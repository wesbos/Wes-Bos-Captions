00:00:01.369 --> 00:00:03.450
<v Tutor>All right, let's talk about writing styles</v>

2
00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:05.470
in our react project.

3
00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:07.330
So there's all kinds

4
00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:10.900
of different ways that you can write CSS in a reacting.

5
00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:12.120
You could literally

6
00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.470
just add classes to elements

7
00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:16.680
and then pop a CSS file in there

8
00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.400
and call it a day.

9
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.350
You can do the same thing with SAS.

10
00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:23.440
You could use utility framework.

11
00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:24.670
One way that I like

12
00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:29.180
to write all my CSS is via scoped CSS.

13
00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:31.500
And the package that we're gonna be using today

14
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:32.700
is stout components.

15
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.150
But the ideas behind stout components

16
00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:39.280
they are relevant in almost all

17
00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.680
of the react base

18
00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:46.080
and even angular and whatnot based scope CSS.

19
00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:49.160
So all of these ideas will translate.

20
00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.220
So the idea behind style components

21
00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:54.760
or CSS in JS as we call it

22
00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.050
is that you define all of your CSS

23
00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.876
in components as well.

24
00:00:59.876 --> 00:01:03.010
And those things have a number of benefits.

25
00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:06.540
First, we're gonna be able to scope our CSS really easily.

26
00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.130
And I'll show you what I mean about that in just a second.

27
00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:13.070
Second, you can use JavaScript values inside of CSS.

28
00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:14.530
So if you have a variable,

29
00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.250
that's part of your state

30
00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.410
or any part of your react application

31
00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:22.230
you can actually use that variable inside

32
00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:23.690
of your your react component.

33
00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:25.620
So rather than get too much into it,

34
00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:27.170
let's just start writing some,

35
00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:28.860
and we'll explain along the way.

36
00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.940
So open up your header.JS

37
00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:34.790
And I think the first thing that we should do

38
00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:38.870
is we wanna apply some styles to this sick fits logo.

39
00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:40.660
So I'm gonna go to the sick fits here

40
00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:42.870
and actually that should be wrapped in h1.

41
00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:44.710
So wrap it in an h1 tag

42
00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:45.670
and then we pop it there.

43
00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:47.800
So let's see...

44
00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.470
There we go sick fits right there.

45
00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:53.280
If I wanted to apply styles to this,

46
00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.113
you might think,

47
00:01:54.113 --> 00:01:55.100
okay, I'll give it a class

48
00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.690
of like header or a class of like logo.

49
00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:02.830
And then you'll go into some other part

50
00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:05.810
of your application and define.logo

51
00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:07.590
But instead of applying classes

52
00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.260
to things and going elsewhere,

53
00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.110
what we're gonna do is we're gonna create

54
00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:15.660
an h1 component with the styles already attached to it.

55
00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.210
And then that will immediately

56
00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:21.250
scope all of the styles to that h1 tag

57
00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:22.270
and make sure that like

58
00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:26.650
if I write like a link inside of this logo component

59
00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.670
and it's not gonna apply to any other links on the page

60
00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.500
or if I say like,

61
00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:33.750
I have a common class,

62
00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.590
like, how many times have you given something

63
00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:38.240
a class of new or special or something like that.

64
00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.340
And then accidentally you use that class

65
00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:41.640
somewhere else on the website

66
00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.710
and that broke it then.

67
00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:45.840
So the idea here is that

68
00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:46.673
we're gonna go up here

69
00:02:46.673 --> 00:02:50.003
and we're to make a variable called Logo.

70
00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.830
And that is equal to a styled.

71
00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.650
And then here is where you will tell it

72
00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:59.620
what type of component you want it to be.

73
00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:00.453
So in our case,

74
00:03:00.453 --> 00:03:01.900
we want it to be a styled.h1

75
00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:05.680
and then we use back techs.

76
00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.840
So don't use quotes, double quotes.

77
00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.210
We wanna use back techs.

78
00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:11.920
And this is what is referred

79
00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.680
to as a tag template literal,

80
00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:18.090
it's kind of like just running a function called styled.h1

81
00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.750
then we'll go ahead and we'll import styles.

82
00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:23.620
So start import styles from style components.

83
00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.300
And then let's start writing our CSS inside of here.

84
00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:29.103
So we'll say background is red.

85
00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:34.590
Then what we do to apply the CSS, right?

86
00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:37.560
This CSS has not been applied to anything just yet

87
00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:38.650
is that we're going to go

88
00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:43.010
to where we have used our h1

89
00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:45.330
and we are gonna replace the h1

90
00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:48.030
with our new component that we just made.

91
00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:49.870
We'll call it Logo.

92
00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:51.400
And then when I give it a save here

93
00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.844
you'll see that this Logo

94
00:03:53.844 --> 00:03:57.200
it's still being rendered as an h1

95
00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:58.200
but it's got this like

96
00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.240
sort of pseudo random or not pseudos,

97
00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:03.850
it's totally random ID attached to it.

98
00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:06.470
And then that is associated with whatever styles

99
00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:07.340
we write on.

100
00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:11.080
Now, actually let's change that up a little bit.

101
00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:14.980
This Logo should encompass the entire link tag.

102
00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:16.483
So let's make sure we do that.

103
00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:20.500
Okay. So we've got our Logo

104
00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.060
and then we have the Lincoln side of it

105
00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:24.610
and that translates to an h1 tag

106
00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:26.300
with an a inside of it.

107
00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:31.100
Now, if I go in here and I select the link, like a

108
00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:36.100
and I maybe say color is equal to white

109
00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:39.630
you'll see that it turns white

110
00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:41.452
and that doesn't turn the rest

111
00:04:41.452 --> 00:04:43.310
of the links on the page white.

112
00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:45.488
It only turns the links inside

113
00:04:45.488 --> 00:04:48.100
of the style that h1 white.

114
00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:49.260
And that's really, really nice

115
00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:50.580
because now I don't have to go adding

116
00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:53.060
like you still can add classes to things, I did

117
00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:55.120
and we'll look at how to do that,

118
00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:58.320
but I no longer have to think of a class name

119
00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:01.080
a very specific class to add to this link

120
00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:03.229
and oh! It accidentally applied to something else.

121
00:05:03.229 --> 00:05:04.780
All of the styles

122
00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:06.560
that I write inside of here,

123
00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:08.110
first of all the top level ones

124
00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:10.780
will be applied directly to the h1.

125
00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:13.370
And then you can also have descendant selectors

126
00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:17.300
inside of each of these style components.

127
00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:21.160
So let's start writing a little bit of CSS on here.

128
00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:22.530
We haven't done like a reset

129
00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:24.760
or global styles or fonts or anything just yet.

130
00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:26.480
That'll come in the next video,

131
00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:28.220
but for now let's get some base styles

132
00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:29.590
on this h1 going.

133
00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:32.260
So we'll say font size is 4rem,

134
00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:37.260
margin left 2rem, position relative, Z index 2

135
00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:41.940
and by the way these completions

136
00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:44.700
that I'm doing here again is z2.

137
00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:46.320
And I just open it up and say,

138
00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:49.260
expand abbreviation.

139
00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:53.350
If you don't have a keyboard shortcut hooked up to that,

140
00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:56.460
you can do so in your vs code settings,

141
00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:00.660
I added control E to that one myself

142
00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:02.280
so that it will expand.

143
00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:04.150
And that's how I write CSS so quickly

144
00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:06.510
as I use these Emmet expansion.

145
00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:08.820
And then we want transform,

146
00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:11.923
we'll say skew(-7deg), okay.

147
00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:16.420
Text decoration none on that link.

148
00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:17.740
Okay. Looking good.

149
00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:19.610
Text transform uppercase

150
00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:24.610
and padding is 0.5rem and 1REM.

151
00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:28.230
Okay. So that's very basic CSS.

152
00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:29.530
We're gonna make it look a lot better

153
00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:30.790
than that in just a second,

154
00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:33.360
but that's our basics for now

155
00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:35.430
in terms of how do we create a style component.

156
00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:39.090
Now, if this logo here was to be reused

157
00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:42.420
in other portions of the website

158
00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:43.340
then what I would do is

159
00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:45.710
I would stick this in its own file

160
00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:47.150
or its own component

161
00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:49.260
and then import it as I needed it.

162
00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:52.230
So we can take a look real quick at our components.

163
00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:54.720
Our styles folder here has a list

164
00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:56.380
of all these different styles

165
00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:58.230
that I have provided for you.

166
00:06:58.230 --> 00:07:01.030
So, some form styles.

167
00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:01.890
So here we go,

168
00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:04.700
const Forms = styled.form.

169
00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:06.809
It's got the box shadow, the font size

170
00:07:06.809 --> 00:07:10.810
and anywhere I want to apply these form styles

171
00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:12.590
I simply just need to import it.

172
00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:15.230
And in place of using a regular form tag

173
00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:18.370
I can use a style component form tag

174
00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:20.600
and it still takes all the regular attributes

175
00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:22.290
and props that you're used to.

176
00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:23.240
What else do we have here?

177
00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:25.006
Pagination, we'll go through all these

178
00:07:25.006 --> 00:07:26.360
as we need them

179
00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:29.410
but just know that these are all reasonable styles

180
00:07:29.410 --> 00:07:31.440
that we use throughout the website.

181
00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:33.740
So some people say,

182
00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:38.130
yeah, always put your styles in a separate file.

183
00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:41.080
My sort of mantra or my way of approaching this

184
00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:44.220
is I don't like to have too many files

185
00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:45.270
because that gets confusing.

186
00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:47.910
I get overwhelmed with all the files,

187
00:07:47.910 --> 00:07:48.760
too many files for me.

188
00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:51.400
So I'll just define the styles

189
00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:53.660
in the component where I use it.

190
00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:55.810
And then as I find either,

191
00:07:55.810 --> 00:07:56.850
it's getting too big

192
00:07:56.850 --> 00:07:58.300
in this one component

193
00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:00.710
or I need to reuse this style

194
00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:04.430
in six or seven or even two different places in the website

195
00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:07.680
then I'll stick it in its own file, export it

196
00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:08.879
and then import it

197
00:08:08.879 --> 00:08:10.530
like a regular old component

198
00:08:10.530 --> 00:08:12.600
into any other place

199
00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:14.463
that I specifically need it.

200
00:08:15.310 --> 00:08:17.880
Okay. So we got our styled h1

201
00:08:19.090 --> 00:08:20.070
that's looking pretty good.

202
00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:21.920
Let's make another one

203
00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:23.730
for this header right here.

204
00:08:23.730 --> 00:08:25.240
So what we'll do here

205
00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:27.160
we wanna style this header.

206
00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:30.223
So we'll say const Headerstyles

207
00:08:31.161 --> 00:08:31.994
And sometimes I like to put

208
00:08:31.994 --> 00:08:34.750
or usually I like to put header styles on the end

209
00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:37.710
just so that it notes to me that it is a stalled component

210
00:08:37.710 --> 00:08:40.987
and not a regular react component.

211
00:08:40.987 --> 00:08:43.990
And that is this styled.header''

212
00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:45.820
it's a header component, right?

213
00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:46.900
And then we'll go in here

214
00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:51.900
and let's just a background red again on that.

215
00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:55.720
And just triple check that it's working

216
00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:57.370
kind of one funny thing about this

217
00:08:57.370 --> 00:09:00.090
is I'm going to show you how to put variables

218
00:09:00.090 --> 00:09:02.100
like red variable in here,

219
00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:04.250
but the the red that I've chosen

220
00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:06.860
is actually just red.

221
00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:07.730
So it's kind of nice.

222
00:09:07.730 --> 00:09:10.200
You can just use the word red if you want.

223
00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:11.110
But what we're going to do here

224
00:09:11.110 --> 00:09:14.230
is where our place the open and close tag

225
00:09:14.230 --> 00:09:15.260
with our header styles.

226
00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:16.870
And now I give it a save.

227
00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:18.110
It doesn't change the markup

228
00:09:18.110 --> 00:09:21.520
but it does change which CSS is being applied to it.

229
00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:23.040
So we don't want background red

230
00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:27.920
but we do want to grab the bar inside of it.

231
00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:30.720
That's why I've popped that class there.

232
00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:32.393
It'll say border bottom.

233
00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:35.943
There we go.

234
00:09:35.943 --> 00:09:40.350
That one, 10px solid black,

235
00:09:40.350 --> 00:09:41.910
and that black is actually going

236
00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:44.270
to be a variable black.

237
00:09:44.270 --> 00:09:47.970
So let's do this var(--black,black)

238
00:09:49.930 --> 00:09:50.763
And what we'll do

239
00:09:50.763 --> 00:09:53.070
is we'll set a CSS variable called black.

240
00:09:53.070 --> 00:09:56.290
That's slightly different in just a bit,

241
00:09:56.290 --> 00:09:57.700
but for now we'll just set it

242
00:09:57.700 --> 00:09:59.350
to fall back to regular old black.

243
00:09:59.350 --> 00:10:01.870
That's what the second argument of Varas.

244
00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:02.910
If you've never seen this before,

245
00:10:02.910 --> 00:10:04.450
this is part of CSS.

246
00:10:04.450 --> 00:10:07.290
This is not a specific JavaScript thing.

247
00:10:07.290 --> 00:10:09.270
Stock components does have the ability

248
00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:11.470
to do like theme variables,

249
00:10:11.470 --> 00:10:13.300
but with CSS variables,

250
00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:15.820
I haven't found a necessary

251
00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:18.180
or a need for that specific thing.

252
00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:19.570
So I've just been doing that.

253
00:10:19.570 --> 00:10:22.530
We'll display a grid on that

254
00:10:22.530 --> 00:10:23.880
grid template columns.

255
00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:27.890
GTC is going to be auto 1fr

256
00:10:27.890 --> 00:10:32.890
justified content is space between aligned items center.

257
00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:40.390
Is looking pretty good.

258
00:10:40.390 --> 00:10:45.390
And then we'll grab the other one .sub-bar display grid.

259
00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:48.550
We're not adding mobile styles right now.

260
00:10:48.550 --> 00:10:49.980
We will come back to that.

261
00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:52.920
So if it's looking a little funky on your phone

262
00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:57.920
that's why grid template columns is 1fr auto border bottom.

263
00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:05.230
Actually, let's just don't duplicate that one up here

264
00:11:07.390 --> 00:11:11.023
Looking good, that should just be 1px not 10.

265
00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:15.800
All right. So that's the very basics of our styles.

266
00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:17.350
That's how we're going to be writing all

267
00:11:17.350 --> 00:11:19.330
of the styles in this project.

268
00:11:19.330 --> 00:11:20.670
I personally use this on,

269
00:11:20.670 --> 00:11:23.400
I dunno, probably three or four different projects

270
00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:24.610
I have in production.

271
00:11:24.610 --> 00:11:26.480
And I am a big fan of it

272
00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:29.610
because it doesn't get you too far away

273
00:11:29.610 --> 00:11:33.296
from what regular CSS looks like

274
00:11:33.296 --> 00:11:36.360
but it does still give you all of the benefits

275
00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:38.767
of being able to scope it.

276
00:11:38.767 --> 00:11:40.400
Last thing you're gonna notice is

277
00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:42.160
that if you refresh the page here,

278
00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:43.750
you're gonna see that it does this

279
00:11:43.750 --> 00:11:45.110
like flicker where you get

280
00:11:45.110 --> 00:11:47.600
like the unstyled page for just a second.

281
00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:49.050
We're gonna look at how to fix that

282
00:11:49.050 --> 00:11:50.380
with server-side rendering

283
00:11:50.380 --> 00:11:52.313
in a coming video.
