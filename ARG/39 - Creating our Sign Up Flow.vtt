1
00:00:00.151 --> 00:00:01.166
(whooshing)

2
00:00:01.166 --> 00:00:01.999
<v Instructor>All right, next,</v>

3
00:00:01.999 --> 00:00:03.600
we need the sign up feature.

4
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.540
So I'm gonna go ahead and sign out,

5
00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:07.448
go to the sign in page

6
00:00:07.448 --> 00:00:10.840
and we are going to add a new block here

7
00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:12.940
that says sign up for an account.

8
00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:16.250
And I'm gonna duplicate the sign in

9
00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:19.230
because the component is gonna be very similar.

10
00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.600
So what we'll do is we'll go to our signin component,

11
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.990
which is, why am I looking for it right here?

12
00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:28.830
Let's just look in here.

13
00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.870
Signin, there we go.

14
00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:34.097 line:15% 
I'm gonna save a copy of that as SignUp.

15
00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:38.823 line:15% 
Capital S, capital U, .js.

16
00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:45.070
Then let's just quickly replace the SignIn to SignUp.

17
00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:52.630
And we'll go to the SignIn page, right?

18
00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:54.180
This one right here.

19
00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.707
Duplicate SignIn.

20
00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:58.917
That's just gonna be SignUp.

21
00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:01.600
And then duplicate this

22
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.833
and this will be SignUp as well.

23
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.300
Okay, so now we have two of our components.

24
00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:11.580
Let's do a quick little grid

25
00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.810
so these things can go side by side.

26
00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:15.790
So we'll say const Grid

27
00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:18.363
is equal to styled.div.

28
00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:21.363
Gotta import styled.

29
00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:24.203
Boom.

30
00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:28.890
Let's actually get it going first.

31
00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.590
Or maybe GridStyles we'll call it.

32
00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.100
Okay and then display: grid,

33
00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.253
grid-template-columns: repeat.

34
00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:46.443
We're gonna auto-fill it.

35
00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.520
A minmax of minimum, I don't know, 300px,

36
00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:54.633
maximum 1fr.

37
00:01:55.997 --> 00:01:56.830
There we go.

38
00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:59.153
We need a bit of gap, a grid-gap: 2rem.

39
00:02:01.354 --> 00:02:02.543
There we go.

40
00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:05.260
So at a certain point,

41
00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.280
they should, yeah, see, at a certain point they go down

42
00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:08.750
to one grid.

43
00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.760
I like that because actually when it's that big,

44
00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.373
we need auto-fit.

45
00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.130
There we go, that'll stretch 'em all the way across.

46
00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:22.290
Not auto-fill, auto-fill will just do them the auto size

47
00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.423
and they won't stretch to the bigger but auto-fit will.

48
00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.070
Okay, let's go into our SignUp component

49
00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:30.980
and start replacing things.

50
00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.540
First, let's do the inputs.

51
00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.570
Then we'll go back and switch up the mutation here.

52
00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:41.240
So first thing is this one.

53
00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:43.523
Sign Up For An Account.

54
00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.353
Then we also have our useForm just here.

55
00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.137
So we have our email, our password.

56
00:02:54.137 --> 00:02:56.890
We also want to collect the user's name.

57
00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:59.420
So we'll do a name there.

58
00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.030
Then we'll go down to where we have the email.

59
00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:04.910
We'll just duplicate that

60
00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:08.073
and change one of them to be Your Name.

61
00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:10.780
Type is text.

62
00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.130
Name is name.

63
00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:14.993
Placeholder is Your Name.

64
00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:18.523
autoComplete equals name.

65
00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:20.633
Is it?

66
00:03:20.633 --> 00:03:22.073
Let's check that one out real quick.

67
00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:26.033
autoComplete mdn.

68
00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.220
Give me a list of them, here we go.

69
00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:33.053
Name.

70
00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:35.270
Okay, so it just could be name

71
00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:38.550
but it also could be any of these more specific ones.

72
00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:41.103
Honorific-prefix, that's very nice.

73
00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:43.823
Value: inputs.name.

74
00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:48.800
Okay, so now if we type in here.

75
00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:50.293
Good, that's looking good.

76
00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:56.550
So when somebody submits this form here,

77
00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:00.713
we want to create a user.

78
00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:06.793
So we can delete everything.

79
00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:13.696
Let's keep none of it.

80
00:04:13.696 --> 00:04:14.530
(instructor laughing)

81
00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:15.870
let's keep none of it.

82
00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:20.413
So const SIGNUP_MUTATION is equal to gql.

83
00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:28.143
There, mutation, we'll take the name of that.

84
00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:30.610
And there are three things

85
00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:32.130
that will need to be passed here.

86
00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:35.747
The first one is email, which is a string.

87
00:04:41.135 --> 00:04:42.182
It's required.

88
00:04:42.182 --> 00:04:44.525
Second one is a name,

89
00:04:44.525 --> 00:04:45.840
which is a string that's required

90
00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.751
and the third one is a password,

91
00:04:48.751 --> 00:04:50.200
which is a string

92
00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:55.033
that is required.

93
00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:57.920
Oops, I need a capital S on that

94
00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:01.163
and a dollar sign in front of the variable name.

95
00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:04.190
Then inside of that,

96
00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:06.710
we will use the createUser API

97
00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:09.280
that's part of Keystone that exposes to us

98
00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:12.680
and if we take a look at our mutation here,

99
00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:14.310
it is createUser.

100
00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:17.430
That then takes in a data object

101
00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:19.035
and then in the data object,

102
00:05:19.035 --> 00:05:22.190
you need any of these options here.

103
00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:24.273
So we are going to be running createUser.

104
00:05:25.939 --> 00:05:27.283
That passes data.

105
00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:33.110
And then in there, we have the email,

106
00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:37.683
the name, the password, properties,

107
00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:45.163
and those are going to be the variables of the same name.

108
00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:51.330
Okay, looks like I put that all on one line for us.

109
00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:54.000
So let me make this a bit wider

110
00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.350
so we can see what we're doing here.

111
00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:56.220
Cool.

112
00:05:56.220 --> 00:06:01.220
And then back from that, we wanna grab the id,

113
00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:04.513
the email and the name of the actual user.

114
00:06:05.599 --> 00:06:06.550
Okay.

115
00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:08.760
So that is our mutation.

116
00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:11.050
Now let's go here

117
00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:15.380
and this method here, signin, we can rename it

118
00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:20.870
to signup and you see why renaming it like that,

119
00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:24.423
it also changed the value of me using it right here.

120
00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:28.520
Then we pass the SIGNUP_MUTATION.

121
00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:30.320
The variables are still the inputs

122
00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:32.743
that get typed in there.

123
00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:38.083
And the refetch of the CURRENT_USER is valid as well.

124
00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:42.890
Actually, we, no, we don't need that one

125
00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:47.250
because signing up will not log the user in.

126
00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:49.570
Singing up will just make the user in the backend

127
00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:50.820
and then we have to ask the user.

128
00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:53.070
So we can actually get rid of that refetch.

129
00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:54.720
I'll just comment it out for now.

130
00:06:55.570 --> 00:06:57.330
Next, we've got this error here.

131
00:06:57.330 --> 00:06:59.210
So this error's a little bit funky the way

132
00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:00.300
we had to handle that.

133
00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:05.270
I would imagine it's the same thing if we submit some data

134
00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:07.170
that's not correct.

135
00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:12.170
Like let's try create a user with an email of no.

136
00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:14.010
Like not a real email.

137
00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:17.120
And then get back from it, we want the id of the user.

138
00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:21.330
So if I run that, we get, yeah, we get an errors reply here

139
00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:22.163
and then data.

140
00:07:22.163 --> 00:07:27.150
So we'll have to see if it actually throws a 404 error

141
00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:29.140
or if we have to do this little song and dance.

142
00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:34.023
So let's destructure the error from this as well.

143
00:07:36.161 --> 00:07:39.253
And when we submit it,

144
00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:45.520
let's just console.log out all that data.

145
00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:49.890
See what we're working with.

146
00:07:49.890 --> 00:07:52.230
So that should be the basics of singing up.

147
00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:55.023
So we'll go back to our sign up page.

148
00:07:56.350 --> 00:07:57.840
Identifier error has already been,

149
00:07:57.840 --> 00:07:59.040
oh, it's 'cause of this.

150
00:08:00.015 --> 00:08:01.373
We've gotta comment that out.

151
00:08:03.850 --> 00:08:05.673
All right, so test,

152
00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:09.510
test@example.com.

153
00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:12.660
Always use example.com when you're testing things

154
00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:17.180
because even if you are using a mail trapping account,

155
00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:18.401
which we'll get into in a second,

156
00:08:18.401 --> 00:08:21.020
you don't accidentally wanna send somebody an email.

157
00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:25.317
And example.com has been set aside for stuff like that.

158
00:08:25.317 --> 00:08:26.863
And then password.

159
00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:29.233
Anything you want.

160
00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:32.690
Ready, open up the dev tools.

161
00:08:32.690 --> 00:08:33.563
Sign in.

162
00:08:35.060 --> 00:08:39.420
Okay, so we got on line 38

163
00:08:43.410 --> 00:08:47.100
data, loading, error is undefined.

164
00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:50.560
37, this is the data, createUser.

165
00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:53.800
Good, so that actually worked.

166
00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:57.700
If we go back to our backend here, now go to Users,

167
00:08:57.700 --> 00:09:00.040
look, there's that user now it has been shown up.

168
00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:01.137
Okay.

169
00:09:01.137 --> 00:09:04.550
Now my question is how do we let the user know

170
00:09:04.550 --> 00:09:05.440
that it worked?

171
00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:06.925
And then second, how do we,

172
00:09:06.925 --> 00:09:11.925
let's make sure we're handling any errors properly

173
00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:13.010
and showing them to the user?

174
00:09:13.010 --> 00:09:16.380
So there are a couple of ways

175
00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:18.760
you could successfully let the user know

176
00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:23.760
that they have been signed up.

177
00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:26.320
You could just check if the user's in the response here

178
00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:27.260
and throw up an alert.

179
00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:28.820
But likely what you wanna do

180
00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:31.000
is show something in here.

181
00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:32.080
So what I'm gonna do

182
00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:35.830
is right inside this fieldset right here,

183
00:09:35.830 --> 00:09:38.410
we're gonna check for the user.

184
00:09:38.410 --> 00:09:40.750
So I'll say data dot, what was it?

185
00:09:40.750 --> 00:09:45.750
createUser, so if we have both of them,

186
00:09:46.098 --> 00:09:51.098
then we'll give it a paragraph tag,

187
00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:57.100
signed up with data.createUser.

188
00:09:57.890 --> 00:09:59.740
We don't need that dollar sign there.

189
00:10:01.117 --> 00:10:01.950
.email.

190
00:10:03.820 --> 00:10:06.883
Please Go Ahead and Sign in.

191
00:10:09.090 --> 00:10:11.120
Okay, cool, so what we did here

192
00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:14.790
is now that we're successfully in the signup state,

193
00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:15.623
it's kind of nice

194
00:10:15.623 --> 00:10:17.322
that I didn't have to try sign up again.

195
00:10:17.322 --> 00:10:20.110
We see this right here.

196
00:10:20.110 --> 00:10:24.950
You could also do that up here.

197
00:10:24.950 --> 00:10:26.070
You can say if

198
00:10:29.390 --> 00:10:30.223
data.createUser,

199
00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:37.550
then we could return what we just were doing.

200
00:10:37.550 --> 00:10:38.390
Right here, this paragraph.

201
00:10:38.390 --> 00:10:39.350
Maybe we'll do that in a sec

202
00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:42.010
because there's no reason to show them the signup form

203
00:10:42.010 --> 00:10:45.760
if they've successfully signed in or signed up.

204
00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:47.363
So let's do that there.

205
00:10:48.370 --> 00:10:53.110
Okay, cool, then actually even one further

206
00:10:53.110 --> 00:10:58.110
is we could probably show the sign in form as well

207
00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:01.150
but it's right next to each other,

208
00:11:01.150 --> 00:11:02.330
so we don't really wanna do that.

209
00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:06.430
So I think I like it the other way better

210
00:11:06.430 --> 00:11:07.390
now that I think about it

211
00:11:07.390 --> 00:11:08.820
just 'cause now this is weird.

212
00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:11.640
You've taken away the form entirely.

213
00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:14.630
So we'll do that.

214
00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:15.860
Okay, give it a refresh.

215
00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:17.640
Let's try once more.

216
00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:22.440
So testyyy, test@example.com.

217
00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:23.940
Actually, just gotta be test2.

218
00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:27.673
And a password.

219
00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:33.170
Nothing was returned.

220
00:11:33.170 --> 00:11:34.850
This usually means this statement.

221
00:11:34.850 --> 00:11:36.303
Okay, something went wrong.

222
00:11:39.580 --> 00:11:40.490
Nothing was returned.

223
00:11:40.490 --> 00:11:43.663
Oh, it's 'cause I forget to delete this that's why.

224
00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:47.723
Let's try it one more time.

225
00:11:50.791 --> 00:11:52.657
Test3@example.com.

226
00:11:55.730 --> 00:11:56.563
Good.

227
00:11:56.563 --> 00:11:58.020
Okay, so that works.

228
00:11:58.020 --> 00:11:59.090
Now my question is what happens

229
00:11:59.090 --> 00:12:02.860
if I sign up with that email again?

230
00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:05.500
That should error and we should display it to the user.

231
00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:08.693
So test, that's the email.

232
00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:10.853
Sign in.

233
00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:12.653
There we go.

234
00:12:14.110 --> 00:12:15.520
Error: duplicate key.

235
00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:18.182
This is fine that this has popped up

236
00:12:18.182 --> 00:12:21.380
because it's showing us in development

237
00:12:21.380 --> 00:12:24.740
and our error here, oh, there we go,

238
00:12:24.740 --> 00:12:28.730
the error is being thrown as a proper error.

239
00:12:28.730 --> 00:12:30.710
So we don't need to do this weird song and dance

240
00:12:30.710 --> 00:12:32.240
that we did before.

241
00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:36.160
We can just get the error from useMutation.

242
00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:37.430
And then grab it.

243
00:12:37.430 --> 00:12:38.800
I think

244
00:12:40.810 --> 00:12:45.810
the reason why it is actually saying an uncaught error

245
00:12:46.470 --> 00:12:51.470
is because we are doing it, is our onSubmit right here.

246
00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:53.730
It's not actually catching it.

247
00:12:55.370 --> 00:12:57.160
Right here, this right here.

248
00:12:57.160 --> 00:12:58.210
This is throwing an error

249
00:12:58.210 --> 00:12:59.440
but we're not catching it

250
00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:02.360
because it's also being put into this value here

251
00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:06.000
but in order to stop this uncaught error from happening,

252
00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.182
we can catch it and just say console.error.

253
00:13:09.182 --> 00:13:11.440
So that might seem like cheating

254
00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:13.860
but don't worry, we've got the value here

255
00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:17.343
and we are appropriately handling it right here.

256
00:13:19.130 --> 00:13:22.770
Beautiful, all right, so that's the sign up flow.

257
00:13:22.770 --> 00:13:25.913
Next, I believe we need to do the password reset flow.
