00:00:01.459 --> 00:00:03.100
<v Wes>All right, let's talk about CRUD.</v>

2
00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:05.860
CRUD means create, read, update, and delete.

3
00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:10.833
And most, I would say almost everything in the world

4
00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:15.170
of programming can be simplified into CRUD.

5
00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:18.620
Maybe put one on the end as well, CRUDS,

6
00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:20.220
which would be for subscribe,

7
00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.500
but if you've got a database and you're saving information,

8
00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:25.300
you're either creating it, you're either reading it,

9
00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:26.720
you're updating it, you're deleting it,

10
00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:31.480
or you're subscribing to all of the above.

11
00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:33.640
And we are going to be talking about,

12
00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:34.780
right now is the second one.

13
00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:37.110
We created them, then we're gonna read them,

14
00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.010
a single product.

15
00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.210
We click on one of the products, 404,

16
00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:42.010
so we're gonna fix that right now.

17
00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:44.170
And then we're going to focus in

18
00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:46.870
on the updating and deleting of the items.

19
00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:49.360
So let's get on into that.

20
00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.490
The thing about these URLs here

21
00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:56.443
is that it's /product/ the actual product ID.

22
00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.780
And if you remember, if you've taken this course,

23
00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:01.600
the last time we did it, last time,

24
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.200
what we did is we did product ID is equal to that.

25
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.100
And that's because Next.js used to not have

26
00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:13.130
like file base routing, but now it does.

27
00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.260
So we're able to put things

28
00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.170
like the product ID right into the URL,

29
00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:19.930
or you could go even one step further

30
00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:22.810
and you could generate a slug for the product,

31
00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:26.350
like nice-chair.

32
00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:28.103
When somebody, when you create the product,

33
00:01:28.103 --> 00:01:31.100
you create a slug and you could use that to look it up.

34
00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:32.790
So whatever this is,

35
00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.160
we're going to use that to look it up in the database.

36
00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:36.650
So the way that we do that

37
00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:40.340
is we're gonna go into our pages here,

38
00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.943
and we're gonna create a folder called product.

39
00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.160
So we're gonna go into our pages directory,

40
00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:49.800
and we're gonna make a new file.

41
00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.190
And I'm gonna show you how to make a folder

42
00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:52.840
and a file at once in VS Code.

43
00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.720
We can say product/,

44
00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.420
and then the name of the file we're gonna create

45
00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.770
is gonna be square brackets, id.js.

46
00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:04.390
So there's a couple of things going on here.

47
00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.520
So it made the folder called product,

48
00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.240
and then we made a file called id.js inside of there.

49
00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:13.150
Now, inside of here, this is going to match,

50
00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.500
this syntax here with the square brackets,

51
00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.660
that is specific to Next.js,

52
00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.590
and what it will do is it is saying,

53
00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:24.853
use this template for anything that has,

54
00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.690
that matches this sort of layout.

55
00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:31.120
So /product/ anything,

56
00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.210
and then what we're gonna do

57
00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:36.140
is it's going to give us a query param called id,

58
00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.070
which we can then use to look up the item in our database.

59
00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:45.070
So if we go in here and we say, export default function,

60
00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:50.120
we'll call it SingleProduct, and then let's just return a p,

61
00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:54.227
says, "Hey, I'm a single product."

62
00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:58.237
Now, if we refresh this page, we say,

63
00:02:58.237 --> 00:03:00.030
"Hey, I'm a single product,"

64
00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:01.980
then if we would go into our rack dev tools

65
00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.760
and go to components, we should see, here we go,

66
00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:06.920
here's our single product component.

67
00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:08.850
And you see that the query,

68
00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:12.880
we now have the ID being supplied to us, why?

69
00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:17.130
Because we name the file square bracket id.js.

70
00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.930
And then what that does is match anything

71
00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:23.060
of this URL product/ whatever.

72
00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:26.320
And then give me that whatever

73
00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:29.960
in a query param and we have access to it,

74
00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:32.350
and you could nest those very much deeper.

75
00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:37.350
If you go to syntax.fm, and you go to one of our episodes,

76
00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:42.360
you'll see that the URL is /show/ show number,

77
00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:46.250
forward slash slug of the actual show.

78
00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:47.780
And if you were to inspect that,

79
00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:50.120
you would see that there is a query param

80
00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:54.680
both for the show number as well as for the slug of the URL.

81
00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:55.860
And if you look at the syntax,

82
00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:58.620
the syntax is built on Next.js as well.

83
00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.100
If you look at the source code,

84
00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:02.150
it's online, it's at GitHub, you can check it out.G

85
00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:03.073
You'll see, oh, let me show you,

86
00:04:03.073 --> 00:04:08.073
GitHub, Wes Bos, syntax, and we'll go into pages.

87
00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:11.970
And then you look at this, we have a folder called show,

88
00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:14.630
which is /show, and you go into there.

89
00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:18.270
And then we have a folder called number.

90
00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:21.640
And then we have a file called slug.js.

91
00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:23.320
And it gives us both the show number

92
00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:26.110
and the slug via the query params.

93
00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:30.000
So we can take that in here

94
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.760
and we can restructure that ID

95
00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:33.950
because it comes in via props.

96
00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:35.780
Remember, this is where props comes in,

97
00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:37.350
but we want props.id.

98
00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:40.380
So we'll the structure the prop id here,

99
00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:42.560
and then we'll go ahead and use it

100
00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:45.270
just by popping id into there.

101
00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:48.690
And it's not showing up.

102
00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:50.180
Oh, you know why?

103
00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:52.370
It's not id, it's query.

104
00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:55.900
And then here we say, query.id.

105
00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:56.733
There we go.

106
00:04:56.733 --> 00:04:58.570
Now the id is showing up,

107
00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:02.535
and we can then hot potato that on to a query.

108
00:05:02.535 --> 00:05:03.883
Let's do that now.

109
00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:07.220
So if I, look, copy this ID,

110
00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:10.670
and go to your API Explorer in the backend,

111
00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:12.420
and let's just write a quick little query

112
00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:14.500
to grab that single item here.

113
00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:17.123
So, man, I got a lot of tabs here.

114
00:05:17.123 --> 00:05:19.500
Well, I'll use this one.

115
00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:24.500
We'll say query as a single, or not single price,

116
00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:29.560
it's just product, where the id is equal to that.

117
00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:37.960
So in here, we are now passing it a filter,

118
00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:42.005
and you wanna ask where the id is equal to that.

119
00:05:42.005 --> 00:05:47.005
There are no other options for the thing here.

120
00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:50.270
So here, we're asking you for a product

121
00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:52.840
where the id is equal to that.

122
00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:55.520
We couldn't say find me a product

123
00:05:55.520 --> 00:06:00.310
where the name is like Yeti.

124
00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:02.660 line:15% 
And I'll show you how to do that in just a second

125
00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:04.030 line:15% 
if that's what you want,

126
00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:06.160 line:15% 
but in our case, just say id, what is that.

127
00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:07.340
And then when that comes back,

128
00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:10.790
we wanna grab the name, the price, the description.

129
00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:12.740
You can go ahead and run that.

130
00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:15.810
What if you wanted to find a product

131
00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:18.030
where it had the name Yeti in it?

132
00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:19.380
Well, if that was the case,

133
00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:23.250
you'd have to look for all products.

134
00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:25.030
And the difference between product

135
00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:29.140
is that it returns one and all products returns multiples.

136
00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:33.290
And if you are ever returning one item from a query,

137
00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:36.360
it must be query based on a unique field.

138
00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:39.910
And the only unique field we have on product is id.

139
00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:42.290
Everything else could be duplicated.

140
00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:45.360
So here we can say, give me all products where,

141
00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:48.110
this is how you do filtering in Keystone.

142
00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:49.700
Most GraphQL clients

143
00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:52.370
will have the very similar filtering though.

144
00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:54.010
I've used maybe six or seven of them.

145
00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:56.000
And they're all very similar to this.

146
00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.890
So we say where, see, look at this, (purrs)

147
00:06:58.890 --> 00:07:03.890
look at every possible input in here and not just id.

148
00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:06.200
So we could say name

149
00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:11.413
contains and there's name_contains, and name_contains_i,

150
00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:14.550
the is for insensitive.

151
00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:18.070
So we'll say where the name contains insensitive Yeti.

152
00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:21.030
And then from that, give me all of the names

153
00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:24.573
and the prices of the product that it finds.

154
00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:26.263
There we go.

155
00:07:26.263 --> 00:07:28.610
All products, look at it, brings us back three things.

156
00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:33.160
Now, sometimes I find myself needing to find one item

157
00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:35.430
based on something that is not unique,

158
00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:36.570
and if that's the case,

159
00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:39.210
I usually just grab the first item

160
00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:40.670
that comes back in that case.

161
00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:41.630
But let's back this up.

162
00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:43.060
We don't necessarily need that right now.

163
00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:44.750
We'll hit that when we get into search.

164
00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:45.680
I thought I would just show you

165
00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:47.250
while we're in the headspace.

166
00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:49.290
So give me a product where the ID is this,

167
00:07:49.290 --> 00:07:51.090
and then we query everything that we want.

168
00:07:51.090 --> 00:07:56.090
So we should be able to take that query and go in here.

169
00:07:56.110 --> 00:08:00.453
And we'll say, let's say const, what is it?

170
00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:06.600
Data, loading, error is equal to useQuery.

171
00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:08.190
And we actually got to write the query.

172
00:08:08.190 --> 00:08:09.023
So go up here,

173
00:08:09.023 --> 00:08:13.667
we'll say const SINGLE_ITEM_QUERY is equal to gql.

174
00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:16.023
Now we're gonna have to back,

175
00:08:16.023 --> 00:08:16.856
we're gonna have to import

176
00:08:16.856 --> 00:08:18.740
a bunch of stuff in just a second.

177
00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:21.530
And then we'll paste our query in there.

178
00:08:21.530 --> 00:08:26.313
Now, we need to import gql, that's from GraphQL tag.

179
00:08:27.450 --> 00:08:29.633
We need to import useQuery.

180
00:08:31.810 --> 00:08:33.720
Okay, and then that's just underlined,

181
00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:35.670
'cause we don't have a prop types for it.

182
00:08:35.670 --> 00:08:38.370
That's totally fine, same with this one.

183
00:08:38.370 --> 00:08:41.240
All right, then we can go back to our useQuery

184
00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:43.953
and pass it our SINGLE_ITEM_QUERY.

185
00:08:44.890 --> 00:08:47.780
And we should be able to console.log

186
00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:50.440
data, loading, and error.

187
00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:53.250
One little tip I like to use in this case

188
00:08:53.250 --> 00:08:57.790
is if you want to know what the values are,

189
00:08:57.790 --> 00:09:00.120
you can wrap it in curly brackets.

190
00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:04.373
So if we go to here and go to our console,

191
00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:11.290
you'll see we get like an object, false and undefined.

192
00:09:11.290 --> 00:09:13.100
If you don't know what these are,

193
00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:15.200
you can wrap them in curly brackets,

194
00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:18.150
and what that does is it logs it as an object

195
00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:19.930
where there's property names

196
00:09:19.930 --> 00:09:21.850
that associate with the variables.

197
00:09:21.850 --> 00:09:23.860
And then we get this nice little object here

198
00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:26.140
where you say data, error, and loading.

199
00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:28.660
And I love that little debugging tip,

200
00:09:28.660 --> 00:09:32.770
because it's easy to see what things are called.

201
00:09:32.770 --> 00:09:35.133
So in our case, if we refresh the page,

202
00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:38.480
we immediately get the data.

203
00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:40.670
No error and loading is false.

204
00:09:40.670 --> 00:09:43.770
But if we were to go back to the homepage

205
00:09:43.770 --> 00:09:46.950
and click on another one, like these Air Max 270's,

206
00:09:46.950 --> 00:09:50.780
you'll see that you might get loading true first,

207
00:09:50.780 --> 00:09:53.800
and then you'll get the data on the second re-render.

208
00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:54.930
And the reason that's happening

209
00:09:54.930 --> 00:09:58.570
is because it's fetching it from the browser.

210
00:09:58.570 --> 00:10:01.000
Whereas if I were just to refresh this page,

211
00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.160
we only get it once.

212
00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:04.280
And the reason behind that is because the first render

213
00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:07.240
is actually happening on the server,

214
00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:09.500
so there is no loading state, which is really nice.

215
00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:12.930
You will also sometimes get that if you click on here

216
00:10:12.930 --> 00:10:15.270
and you click onto a product you haven't been to,

217
00:10:15.270 --> 00:10:17.010
you see, I only got one.

218
00:10:17.010 --> 00:10:22.010
And the reason is that the first load did happen on,

219
00:10:22.510 --> 00:10:24.478
you can see it's right here.

220
00:10:24.478 --> 00:10:25.630
Here we go, loading true.

221
00:10:25.630 --> 00:10:26.810
You can see the first render

222
00:10:26.810 --> 00:10:28.160
actually happened on the server.

223
00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:29.710
The server is our terminal here.

224
00:10:29.710 --> 00:10:32.040
And the second render happened on the client side.

225
00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:34.650
That's a bit of a delicate, not delicate,

226
00:10:34.650 --> 00:10:37.950
but you need to know that some of the renders happen

227
00:10:37.950 --> 00:10:40.970
on the server and some of them happen on the client.

228
00:10:40.970 --> 00:10:42.620
All right, so now that we have that,

229
00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:43.780
look at it, we've got our object,

230
00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:45.280
we've got our data, we've got our product,

231
00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:47.940
and then we get everything that we want in there.

232
00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:51.400
What I wanna do now is let's actually move this,

233
00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:53.170
all of this to its own component.

234
00:10:53.170 --> 00:10:54.330
And the reason behind that

235
00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:56.410
is because this is not very flexible right now.

236
00:10:56.410 --> 00:10:58.690
We just made a single product component,

237
00:10:58.690 --> 00:11:02.140
but it's at a page level, right?

238
00:11:02.140 --> 00:11:03.750
So what we could do is we can make

239
00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:05.650
a single product component

240
00:11:05.650 --> 00:11:07.680
that we could use it wherever we want.

241
00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:10.400
As long as we pass an ID, it will do the querying for us.

242
00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:12.500
So we'll go to our components folder here

243
00:11:13.667 --> 00:11:14.850
and make a new file,

244
00:11:14.850 --> 00:11:19.850
and we'll call it capital S, SingleProduct.js.

245
00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:27.560
And let's move over all of this into SingleProduct.

246
00:11:32.380 --> 00:11:37.380
And then let's also move that over.

247
00:11:38.990 --> 00:11:43.760
So export default function SingleProduct,

248
00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:48.760
that takes in an id of which product you want to query.

249
00:11:49.610 --> 00:11:52.290
And then in here, we'll use that query.

250
00:11:52.290 --> 00:11:55.507
And then we'll return "Single Product."

251
00:11:56.640 --> 00:12:00.500
I'm gonna go back to this one and get rid of that.

252
00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:03.750
And then here, we can simply just return

253
00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:08.670
our single product component where the is

254
00:12:09.620 --> 00:12:11.803
is going to be equal to the query.id.

255
00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:14.970
All right, so I know we did a lot there.

256
00:12:14.970 --> 00:12:18.070
We made a function called SingleProduct.

257
00:12:18.070 --> 00:12:22.390
Oh, this should be called SingleProductPage instead,

258
00:12:22.390 --> 00:12:25.530
that takes in the query, which comes from the browser,

259
00:12:25.530 --> 00:12:28.600
then from that, we return our single product component

260
00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:30.730
which we need to import now.

261
00:12:30.730 --> 00:12:32.670
Okay, that was important there.

262
00:12:32.670 --> 00:12:36.180
And then you pass in the id,

263
00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:40.200
then we'll go into single product here and we can say,

264
00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:45.200
if loading, then return paragraph loading dot, dot, dot,

265
00:12:46.890 --> 00:12:51.890
if error, then return, we have our error,

266
00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:56.113
what was that called?

267
00:12:56.113 --> 00:12:58.633
Error message component.

268
00:13:02.290 --> 00:13:03.123
What did we call that?

269
00:13:03.123 --> 00:13:07.293
I know, DisplayError, okay.

270
00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:12.713
There we go, and then you pass it, your error,

271
00:13:15.930 --> 00:13:18.670
and then otherwise, if we do have data,

272
00:13:18.670 --> 00:13:23.500
so we can return a div where there's like,

273
00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:27.140
let's do an h2 tag with the

274
00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:30.380
data.product.name.

275
00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:35.363
Let's try that.

276
00:13:36.510 --> 00:13:40.720
Cannot access property name, data.product is undefined.

277
00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:43.483
Oh, okay, maybe it is, is it a capital P?

278
00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:48.353
There we go.

279
00:13:48.353 --> 00:13:49.930
So now what we did is we just created

280
00:13:49.930 --> 00:13:54.640
a single product component that all it needs is an ID

281
00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:57.970
and it will be able to display it wherever we want.

282
00:13:57.970 --> 00:14:01.380
So that's pretty cool because what you can do

283
00:14:01.380 --> 00:14:06.250
is you can take the single product component and we could,

284
00:14:06.250 --> 00:14:08.930
let's put it, let's go into our page component.

285
00:14:08.930 --> 00:14:09.810
You don't have to do this,

286
00:14:09.810 --> 00:14:12.010
but let me just show you really quickly.

287
00:14:12.010 --> 00:14:13.440
If you go into your page component,

288
00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:16.290
and let's just go to the footer here.

289
00:14:16.290 --> 00:14:19.050
If I were to want to put a single product

290
00:14:19.050 --> 00:14:22.430
into the component and pass it an id

291
00:14:24.090 --> 00:14:27.453
of, I don't know, let's go find a product.

292
00:14:29.570 --> 00:14:31.180
The Nike VaporMax.

293
00:14:31.180 --> 00:14:34.070
So the ID of this product,

294
00:14:34.070 --> 00:14:36.507
we'll just pass it in right there,

295
00:14:36.507 --> 00:14:37.407
you can import it,

296
00:14:40.460 --> 00:14:41.293
and watch this.

297
00:14:44.238 --> 00:14:47.710
It's showing me Yeti Hondo, why? (laughs)

298
00:14:50.510 --> 00:14:52.020
Did we hard-code the ID?

299
00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:54.820
I think we did, oh, Wes, Wes, Wes.

300
00:14:54.820 --> 00:14:56.950
Okay, so obviously, we hard-coded the ID

301
00:14:56.950 --> 00:14:59.500
of the product to be this.

302
00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:01.220
We need to make that dynamic.

303
00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:04.070
So what we'll do here is we'll modify this,

304
00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:05.129
we'll just call it SINGLE_ITEM_QUERY

305
00:15:05.129 --> 00:15:08.046
or SINGLE_PRODUCT_QUERY.

306
00:15:08.046 --> 00:15:13.046
You pass in id that has a type of ID and is required.

307
00:15:14.490 --> 00:15:18.880
And then in here, we can just pass the id variable.

308
00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:20.510
So that's the first part of it.

309
00:15:20.510 --> 00:15:25.347
And then when we run this query, so here we go, useQuery,

310
00:15:26.281 --> 00:15:27.114
and make this a little bigger

311
00:15:27.114 --> 00:15:28.560
so we can see it all in one line,

312
00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:31.210
you can pass a second argument to useQuery,

313
00:15:31.210 --> 00:15:32.503
which is the variable.

314
00:15:33.530 --> 00:15:35.650
We wanna say the variable id

315
00:15:35.650 --> 00:15:38.070
is going to be equal to whatever ID

316
00:15:38.070 --> 00:15:40.890
got passed in as a prop to this component.

317
00:15:40.890 --> 00:15:42.540
So it's just id as well.

318
00:15:42.540 --> 00:15:43.373
Now, give that a save.

319
00:15:43.373 --> 00:15:46.380
It's going to just shorten it to just id.

320
00:15:46.380 --> 00:15:48.960
And now, whatever ID gets passed in

321
00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:50.960
will be sent to the query, here we go.

322
00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:55.160
Now, whatever product we're on, see KITH Hoodie,

323
00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:59.830
and then Nike VaporMax shows up in the footer, why?

324
00:15:59.830 --> 00:16:00.860
Because we can literally

325
00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:02.830
put this component anywhere we want,

326
00:16:02.830 --> 00:16:05.680
and as long as we pass it an ID of the product,

327
00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:10.490
it will know how and where to get the data from

328
00:16:10.490 --> 00:16:13.570
as well as how to display that actual data.

329
00:16:13.570 --> 00:16:14.840
And that's really cool.

330
00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:18.960
I was making these flexible components that are not so rigid

331
00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:21.910
that they need like a parent data

332
00:16:21.910 --> 00:16:24.620
or they only can be viewed on a specific page,

333
00:16:24.620 --> 00:16:26.260
but you can put them wherever you want.

334
00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:28.050
So obviously, we don't wanna do that in the footer,

335
00:16:28.050 --> 00:16:30.460
so I'll bring that out there.

336
00:16:30.460 --> 00:16:31.780
But now we have our single product.

337
00:16:31.780 --> 00:16:32.700
Okay, so that's that.

338
00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:36.550
Let's do a little bit more styling

339
00:16:36.550 --> 00:16:39.500
so this will show up a little bit neater.

340
00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:42.420
So let's first make this product variable

341
00:16:42.420 --> 00:16:46.243
a little bit shorter, so we'll say const Product,

342
00:16:47.124 --> 00:16:49.040
that's equal to, it's kinda weird

343
00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:50.370
that there's a capital P on it,

344
00:16:50.370 --> 00:16:55.000
but that's just how it comes back from the GraphQL API.

345
00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:56.510
So there's not a whole lot,

346
00:16:56.510 --> 00:16:59.010
well, there is something we could do, I could show you.

347
00:16:59.010 --> 00:17:02.110
If you want it to rename something in your GraphQL query,

348
00:17:02.110 --> 00:17:04.990
you could rename it like items.

349
00:17:04.990 --> 00:17:09.270
And then when they come back, it's gonna be data.items

350
00:17:09.270 --> 00:17:12.542
instead of whatever comes back from the API.

351
00:17:12.542 --> 00:17:14.420
I very rarely need to use that,

352
00:17:14.420 --> 00:17:17.680
just because I just use whatever comes back from the API.

353
00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:21.150
But there's rare cases where if you're trying, not Googling,

354
00:17:21.150 --> 00:17:24.030
if you're querying two different products

355
00:17:24.030 --> 00:17:25.810
with a single item query,

356
00:17:25.810 --> 00:17:27.940
then they both can't be named product.

357
00:17:27.940 --> 00:17:28.773
So what you have to do

358
00:17:28.773 --> 00:17:31.930
is you have to rename them in the query.

359
00:17:31.930 --> 00:17:34.030
But I'm just gonna call it Product here.

360
00:17:34.030 --> 00:17:36.870
I'll say that const Product is equal to data.

361
00:17:36.870 --> 00:17:38.960
And you could also rename them

362
00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:41.990
in the de-structuring like that as well.

363
00:17:41.990 --> 00:17:44.310
Again, I'm not gonna confuse you,

364
00:17:44.310 --> 00:17:45.990
just gonna put a capital on it.

365
00:17:45.990 --> 00:17:47.703
And then we say Product.name.

366
00:17:52.790 --> 00:17:55.713
Let's wrap that in a div with a class of details.

367
00:17:58.360 --> 00:18:01.463
And then below it, we'll do the Product.description.

368
00:18:07.870 --> 00:18:09.840
We do need to go back up here

369
00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:11.850
and modify our query a little bit

370
00:18:11.850 --> 00:18:14.547
because we need the name, the price,

371
00:18:14.547 --> 00:18:17.990
the description, the id, we need the photo.

372
00:18:17.990 --> 00:18:22.090
And inside of that, we need the linked image and the public,

373
00:18:22.090 --> 00:18:24.563
lowercase publicUrlTransformed.

374
00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:33.280
Doesn't look like the description is showing up.

375
00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:35.230
Maybe that one just doesn't have a description.

376
00:18:35.230 --> 00:18:36.320
Let's go to the Yeti Hondo.

377
00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:39.250
No, all right, let's debug that real quick.

378
00:18:39.250 --> 00:18:44.250
We'll go and try to log out the product here.

379
00:18:49.447 --> 00:18:52.670
There we go, product descriptions right there,

380
00:18:52.670 --> 00:18:53.803
did I spell it wrong?

381
00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:04.300
I did, yeah, there's your problem.

382
00:19:04.300 --> 00:19:06.433
Above it, we'll do an image tag.

383
00:19:10.090 --> 00:19:11.470
The source is equal

384
00:19:11.470 --> 00:19:16.470
to the Product.photo.image.publicUrlTransformed.

385
00:19:22.450 --> 00:19:27.450
And then the alt is equal to the Product.name.

386
00:19:30.030 --> 00:19:32.520
You could also take the alt

387
00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:34.440
from the image as well if you wanted,

388
00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:38.700
because we have another one there, so we could do that,

389
00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:41.843
Product.photo.image.alt.

390
00:19:47.150 --> 00:19:49.780
Oh, look at this, so we've got a bit of an error here.

391
00:19:49.780 --> 00:19:51.860
Cannot query field alt on type

392
00:19:51.860 --> 00:19:53.993
CloudinaryImage field, location.

393
00:19:56.360 --> 00:19:58.180
Oh, I think the alt goes up here.

394
00:19:58.180 --> 00:19:59.033
Is that why?

395
00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:03.463
And then here, it's just photo.alt.

396
00:20:06.850 --> 00:20:10.480
No, see, our error component is kicking in there.

397
00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:12.380
It didn't that first time because of hot reloading,

398
00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:14.630
but that won't happen in production.

399
00:20:14.630 --> 00:20:16.870
So that is good.

400
00:20:16.870 --> 00:20:18.300
Why did that not work?

401
00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:20.053
Let's go back to this here.

402
00:20:21.650 --> 00:20:23.173
Let me say our photo.

403
00:20:24.530 --> 00:20:28.693
Oh, altText, come on now, altText.

404
00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:31.693
That's why.

405
00:20:36.940 --> 00:20:39.253
There we go, and hover over top of it.

406
00:20:45.086 --> 00:20:46.260
There we go.

407
00:20:46.260 --> 00:20:47.510
That's looking good.

408
00:20:47.510 --> 00:20:49.610
So we have our image, we've got our details

409
00:20:49.610 --> 00:20:51.690
with our name and our description.

410
00:20:51.690 --> 00:20:53.140
One other thing and this is something

411
00:20:53.140 --> 00:20:57.210
we haven't covered yet is, what about the title tag?

412
00:20:57.210 --> 00:20:59.820
So far, the title tag, they're just saying random stuff

413
00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:02.170
like this page could not be defined.

414
00:21:02.170 --> 00:21:06.310
So if you wanna be able to define the title tag

415
00:21:06.310 --> 00:21:09.770
in your Next.js application, it's pretty simple.

416
00:21:09.770 --> 00:21:12.420
What you do is anywhere you want

417
00:21:12.420 --> 00:21:16.060
to modify items that are in the head,

418
00:21:16.060 --> 00:21:20.063
we simply just embed a capital H Head tag,

419
00:21:21.610 --> 00:21:24.100
and then import that from,

420
00:21:24.100 --> 00:21:25.870
oh, it looks like it's not gonna auto import.

421
00:21:25.870 --> 00:21:28.010
So we'll have to go back up to the top here.

422
00:21:28.010 --> 00:21:33.010
Say import capital H Head from next/head.

423
00:21:36.690 --> 00:21:40.270
And what we'll do there is anything

424
00:21:40.270 --> 00:21:44.250
that gets stuck in here will be injected

425
00:21:44.250 --> 00:21:45.987
into the head of the document.

426
00:21:45.987 --> 00:21:48.520
There is another, if you're not using Next.js,

427
00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:52.000
in my Gatsby tutorial, we use something called helmet.

428
00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:54.180
It works the exact same way.

429
00:21:54.180 --> 00:21:56.760
So in here, we're just gonna call it Sick Fits |,

430
00:21:57.710 --> 00:22:01.073
and we'll put the Product.name in there.

431
00:22:02.130 --> 00:22:06.160
And then you see that the title tag of the tab

432
00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:09.970
is changed when you go to an item.

433
00:22:09.970 --> 00:22:13.420
So we'll have to go through and update those

434
00:22:13.420 --> 00:22:15.030
on every single page,

435
00:22:15.030 --> 00:22:17.040
just so that they all have the correct SEO.

436
00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:19.610
But that's the first time we've used that there.

437
00:22:19.610 --> 00:22:21.860
And we also need a little bit of styling

438
00:22:21.860 --> 00:22:23.500
to get this to look nicely.

439
00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:25.610
We'll write that one together.

440
00:22:25.610 --> 00:22:28.427
Let's go up here, we'll say const ProductStyles

441
00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:35.610
is equal to styled.div.

442
00:22:35.610 --> 00:22:39.023
We will import styled from styled-components.

443
00:22:41.450 --> 00:22:45.120
And we'll just say, background red,

444
00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:46.840
and then take that ProductStyles

445
00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:51.593
and replace it with that wrapping div we have here.

446
00:22:53.730 --> 00:22:56.540
This Head tag can go anywhere you want, by the way.

447
00:22:56.540 --> 00:22:58.280
And that's kind of the cool thing is that,

448
00:22:58.280 --> 00:23:00.740
if you can use it wherever you have your data,

449
00:23:00.740 --> 00:23:02.340
and it isn't like you would have to query

450
00:23:02.340 --> 00:23:05.560
this single product at a page level and pass it down,

451
00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:09.120
you can just pop it in the product where you have it.

452
00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:11.400
Okay, so that looks like it's working.

453
00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:13.973
We'll go back up here and start writing some CSS.

454
00:23:15.974 --> 00:23:17.523
You wanna say display grid.

455
00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:23.030
grid-auto-columns is 1fr,

456
00:23:23.030 --> 00:23:27.160
and grid-auto-flow is column.

457
00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:30.170
That means it will add the items

458
00:23:30.170 --> 00:23:33.580
to the right-hand side in columns,

459
00:23:33.580 --> 00:23:36.393
rather than the default of grid, which is rows.

460
00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:40.063
We'll give it a min-height of 800px,

461
00:23:44.580 --> 00:23:47.663
a max-width of our variable maxWidth.

462
00:23:52.249 --> 00:23:53.630
Then we got to grab this image here.

463
00:23:53.630 --> 00:23:58.083
Let's say width is 100%.

464
00:23:59.020 --> 00:24:01.560
And it's looking better.

465
00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:05.440
Also say height is 100%.

466
00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:07.190
And then we do this.

467
00:24:07.190 --> 00:24:10.190
Let's see, I love doing this with,

468
00:24:10.190 --> 00:24:11.640
that looks like a kid's shoe.

469
00:24:13.690 --> 00:24:16.690
What happened here is depending on how much room we have,

470
00:24:16.690 --> 00:24:19.053
it's obviously gonna get smushed.

471
00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:25.090
And we can use something in CSS called object-fit,

472
00:24:25.090 --> 00:24:27.533
and there is something called contain,

473
00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:31.140
and that will just obviously contain it.

474
00:24:31.140 --> 00:24:35.660
There's also cover, which it will stretch it to fit,

475
00:24:35.660 --> 00:24:36.960
which is not what we want.

476
00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:39.120
We want contain to show,

477
00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:40.920
and that way you don't have to figure out,

478
00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:43.480
okay, is it a wide and short image

479
00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:47.480
or is it a a tall and skinny image?

480
00:24:47.480 --> 00:24:51.210
Contain will just figure it all out for you.

481
00:24:51.210 --> 00:24:54.960
Let's also put this text here in the middle.

482
00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:58.193
So justify-content center, maybe?

483
00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:01.633
No, align-content.

484
00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:04.330
No, it's vertical.

485
00:25:04.330 --> 00:25:09.330
So vertical is items, align-items center.

486
00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:11.910
There we go.

487
00:25:11.910 --> 00:25:14.500
We'll probably put a little bit of gap on there.

488
00:25:14.500 --> 00:25:16.463
I should probably use rems for that.

489
00:25:19.750 --> 00:25:20.750
Actually, you know what?

490
00:25:20.750 --> 00:25:21.863
It should be top.

491
00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:26.223
Take that,

492
00:25:28.770 --> 00:25:30.400
take the height off of there.

493
00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:31.510
I'm not sure why I had that.

494
00:25:31.510 --> 00:25:33.770
That's probably something to do with SEO,

495
00:25:33.770 --> 00:25:35.783
same with this min-height.

496
00:25:37.010 --> 00:25:38.840
Yeah, we don't need those.

497
00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:40.420
Maybe we'll come back when we make sure

498
00:25:40.420 --> 00:25:43.030
that it's all mobile-friendly and add those back in,

499
00:25:43.030 --> 00:25:44.790
but I'm not sure why I had that initially.

500
00:25:44.790 --> 00:25:47.930
Okay, that is looking good.

501
00:25:47.930 --> 00:25:49.120
All right, that is looking good.

502
00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:52.020
That's obviously querying and displaying a single item

503
00:25:52.020 --> 00:25:55.140
on a single page with routing and SEO and all of that.

504
00:25:55.140 --> 00:25:57.853
Let's get into the next one where we update the products.
