1
00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:02.480
We got a real quick problem

2
00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:04.590
with stock components that we need to fix.

3
00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:05.590
It's it's two part

4
00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:06.990
but they're both related to the same thing.

5
00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:08.170
First, when you load the page

6
00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:09.720
you see that you get this.

7
00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:13.310
Warning Prop class name did not match server SCHB

8
00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:14.190
blah, blah, blah.

9
00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:15.590
And the client got this.

10
00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:18.390
You you'll see this a lot in, in react.

11
00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.520
When you're doing server side react

12
00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.110
that also gets re rendered in the browser.

13
00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:26.510
And what's happening here is that the server renders

14
00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:29.850
it one way, and then the client renders it another way.

15
00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:31.090
And there was a difference

16
00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:33.070
between those two

17
00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:35.790
and in this case it's because we're creating random

18
00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:36.623
stock moes

19
00:00:36.623 --> 00:00:38.930
creating random IDs for each of our components.

20
00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:41.310
And then when it hits the, the front end

21
00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:43.830
it re renders it and it gives you another random ID.

22
00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:47.070
So we need to, we need it to be consistently random.

23
00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.177
If that's a thing, if you ever see this error ever again

24
00:00:51.177 --> 00:00:53.210
that's because something is different

25
00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:56.350
on your server then on your client.

26
00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:57.850
So let's go ahead and fix that.

27
00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:00.690
The other issue that we have is that when you reload it,

28
00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.700
sometimes you can see it. Right now

29
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:03.610
It's not showing up for me

30
00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:08.610
but remember earlier we were getting like the blue styling

31
00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:10.910
and just a second later, it would kick in.

32
00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:13.240
And the reason behind that is because

33
00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.910
it wasn't actually rendering the styles

34
00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:18.680
on the server for us, which is what we need.

35
00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.950
Otherwise you get that flicker, flash of unstyle text

36
00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.780
or flash of unstylish content folk.

37
00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.980
So to fix it, we opened up our underscored document file.

38
00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:30.840
And we're actually just going to add some stuff

39
00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.440
from the style components docs.

40
00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:36.920
So if you Google server style sheet styled components,

41
00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.820
you're going to see a link to advanced usage.

42
00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:42.950
And then if we look for the server style sheet

43
00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.950
you see that it has the docs for that right here.

44
00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:51.430
And if we want to use it with next JS,

45
00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:54.280
we need to hook it up to one of their hooks.

46
00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.230
That's called getinitialProps.

47
00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:58.010
And what getinitialProps will do,

48
00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:03.010
is it will wait until that method has been resolved

49
00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:07.970
before it sends the data off from the server to the browser.

50
00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:09.250
So it let's go ahead and do that.

51
00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.940
Let's go to this, my document extends document

52
00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.550
and then above it will say static,

53
00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:17.283
get initial props.

54
00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.430
And in that there's a argument

55
00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:24.069
that we destructure called a render page.

56
00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:25.040
Okay.

57
00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:26.050
And then in it

58
00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:31.050
we say cons sheet is equal to new server style sheet.

59
00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:33.962
Boom, look at that!

60
00:02:33.962 --> 00:02:36.350
I know that I keep getting surprised,

61
00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:38.200
but this like auto import,

62
00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.810
it keeps getting better in vs code.

63
00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.874
I feel like it's gotten better in the last like month or so.

64
00:02:42.874 --> 00:02:44.030
And it's awesome.

65
00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:48.540
And then we say Cons page is equal to render page

66
00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.910
and that takes a callback method,

67
00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:58.410
which gives us our app, which has props.

68
00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:59.540
This is a bit weird.

69
00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.140
I quite honestly, you just take this from the examples.

70
00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:05.440
This is not necessarily something that you'll be

71
00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.820
coding yourself every single time, but we say sheet

72
00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:10.970
which is our stock component

73
00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:12.593
dot collect styles.

74
00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:14.590
And we want to

75
00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:16.400
so what that will do is it will go ahead

76
00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.110
and go through every single component

77
00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:20.070
that needs to be rendered

78
00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:21.220
out to the page.

79
00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:23.870
And it will see if there's any style components

80
00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:25.250
in those components.

81
00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:28.010
And it will rip out the CSS that it needs

82
00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:30.230
and render it out to the server.

83
00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:31.700
And then inside there,

84
00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:35.290
we simply just render out our app tag

85
00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:37.240
and we spread our props

86
00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:38.920
dot, dot, dot props out.

87
00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:40.740
Probably give us a red underline.

88
00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:43.210
That's fine about spreading the props.

89
00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:46.180
Cool. So that gives us an error.

90
00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:49.373
I think we probably need to restart the sucker.

91
00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:52.700
By the way sometimes if you see

92
00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:54.720
an error like that and like there's nothing

93
00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:55.810
in the console here.

94
00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:57.130
You gotta go to your terminal

95
00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:59.850
and you'll be able to see what the error is.

96
00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:02.250
First, just restart it just to make sure.

97
00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:03.690
All right, we have a bit of an error.

98
00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:05.030
Let's dig through it ourselves.

99
00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:07.900
So, if you get an error like this

100
00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:10.700
don't freak out, is a little overwhelming

101
00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:13.180
what I like to do ais to bring it into

102
00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:19.860
a new editor and just kind of look at it here.

103
00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:22.490
So error, document again initial PO should resolve

104
00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:26.250
to an object, but found undefined.

105
00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:28.000
Oh, that's cause we forgot something here.

106
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.070
We forgot to actually grab the style tag.

107
00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:34.910
So Cons style tags is equals to sheet dot

108
00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:36.653
get style element.

109
00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:39.080
Let's just console log that.

110
00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:40.700
I want to see what's in there.

111
00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:41.740
I'm also curious.

112
00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:44.240
Sometimes you take these, these examples from the docs

113
00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:47.620
but it's helpful to know exactly what's going on in here

114
00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:51.660
and then return an object with the page inside of it.

115
00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:54.890
And then we add the style tags

116
00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:55.723
along with it.

117
00:04:55.723 --> 00:04:57.498
And what this essentially is doing

118
00:04:57.498 --> 00:05:01.970
it's taking whatever the page had to initially get.

119
00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:04.440
And then adding on one more step,

120
00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:06.540
which is gathering all of the CSS.

121
00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:09.763
Now I believe a restart that sucker.

122
00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:12.960
There we go, we got our things shown up.

123
00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:14.510
We can look at that console log.

124
00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:16.360
It looks like it's just logging a bunch

125
00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:19.780
of react elements that have CSS inside of them.

126
00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:21.370
So we'll get rid of that.

127
00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:23.250
And then the other thing is we're still getting

128
00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:24.083
this issue here.

129
00:05:24.083 --> 00:05:26.250
Prop class name did not match server.

130
00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:27.104
Okay. So this happens to me sometimes with the same issue,

131
00:05:27.104 --> 00:05:31.170
and am like, what I did the thing, I did it.

132
00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:33.700
Why is it broken still?

133
00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:35.940
And I found

134
00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:36.773
On here.

135
00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:41.680
In 15 days ago, this is the biggest threat ever.

136
00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:43.830
Deleting the next folder solve the problem for me.

137
00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:45.050
So I bet that's it.

138
00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:47.240
Any time that you have you fix something

139
00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:49.380
it doesn't seem to actually have taken effect

140
00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:51.180
probably as a caching issue.

141
00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:53.530
So what we can do here is I'm gonna kill the build

142
00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:55.770
and open it in my finder.

143
00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:57.800
And you'll see in front end

144
00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:01.040
there is a doc next folder in this has all the cache

145
00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:02.880
from everything that we've been building.

146
00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:05.600
So sometimes you just need to kill that

147
00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:09.023
delete it and start that sucker up again.

148
00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:11.580
I bet money!

149
00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:12.713
This will fix it.

150
00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:20.160
Ah, yeah, it's working.

151
00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:20.993
Okay, cool.

152
00:06:20.993 --> 00:06:24.240
So that's how you get a server-side rendered style sheets

153
00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:28.070
and consistent random ideas working

154
00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:29.927
in style components and (mumbled).
