00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:02.950
<v Wes>Let's talk about GraphQL.</v>

2
00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:04.510
Why is it so good?

3
00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:05.570
Why do people like it?

4
00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:07.260
Why are we even taking this course?

5
00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:12.260
So GraphQL is what I call a specification

6
00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:17.460
for requesting data and pushing data updates

7
00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:18.720
to and from a server.

8
00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.410
So GraphQL is not a library in itself.

9
00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:23.360
It's just a, it's an idea.

10
00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:26.800
It's a whole bunch of ideas in a specification.

11
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.220
And then what happens is that library maintainers

12
00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:33.890
people that build Keystone, people that build Apollo

13
00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:38.350
they go and implement that as a layer on top of a database

14
00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:40.200
which is exactly what Keystone is.

15
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.470
So if we want to be able to create products,

16
00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:45.510
push products, get a list of the product,

17
00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.650
get a list of users and their products.

18
00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:49.630
We will use GraphQL for that.

19
00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:51.690
So you're not gonna be able to do this

20
00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.000
because you probably don't have the finished version running

21
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.680
but I'm just gonna give you a quick visual

22
00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.700
of what GraphQL looks like.

23
00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.450
So when I'm in my Keystone here

24
00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:01.630
I can go to the API Explorer.

25
00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:03.460
And this brings up,

26
00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.590
sometimes this is referred to as graphical.

27
00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.850
This is a sign called a GraphQL Playground, actually.

28
00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:13.540
And you could see I've got all kinds of

29
00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:15.480
interesting stuff going on in here.

30
00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:16.910
I'm just gonna open up a new tab.

31
00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:18.050
Let's bump that up.

32
00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:20.290
So the way that it works is

33
00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:23.950
that we write these things called queries and mutations

34
00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.220
to either queries we'll pull data down from the API

35
00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:29.270
and mutations will either create data

36
00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.180
or update existing data.

37
00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:33.130
So let's write our first query here.

38
00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:34.710
And I open up curly brackets.

39
00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.780
Now GraphQL is its own syntax.

40
00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.850
And we're gonna have to get a little bit used to that

41
00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.620
but it very much looks like JavaScript objects

42
00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:44.120
just without the actual values.

43
00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:45.330
It's just the properties.

44
00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:49.430
So the query that we want is we can say, oh, look at this.

45
00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:52.820
So the nice thing about GraphQL is it is typed.

46
00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.270
Meaning that everything is specified beforehand,

47
00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.770
as well as if it's a string or a number

48
00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:03.650
or a relationship to a user or anything like that.

49
00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:04.880
So as you start typing

50
00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.810
and you get this really nice auto-complete dropdown

51
00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.860
and these are all the queries that we have right here.

52
00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.110
So we can take a look here.

53
00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:15.450
Let's take a look at all products.

54
00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.528
And then the idea with GraphQL is you can't just say

55
00:02:18.528 --> 00:02:20.350
give me all the products

56
00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:22.310
and it will give you every single field,

57
00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.920
every single the name, the image, the price

58
00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:25.850
it'll give you everything about it.

59
00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:27.370
It won't do that actually.

60
00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.130
You have to explicitly ask

61
00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.470
for the parts of the thing that you want.

62
00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.450
So for the product we want the name,

63
00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:37.970
let's, and the description, and maybe the price.

64
00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:40.150
Then when I hit go,

65
00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.080
what it does is it brings back to us.

66
00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:43.690
You see how, like I said, it was like,

67
00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:47.130
it looks like an object but without the actual values,

68
00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:48.330
it's just the properties.

69
00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:49.850
What it will do is it will bring back

70
00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:51.450
to you what you asked for,

71
00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:56.370
but with the data filled in on all the properties,

72
00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:57.850
which is really, really nice.

73
00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:01.300
So no longer do you have to create a whole bunch

74
00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:04.210
of different rest end points that specify,

75
00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:07.251
like give me the products with their name and description

76
00:03:07.251 --> 00:03:10.670
or give me the products with all the information.

77
00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:13.470
You just have to ask for the thing that you want

78
00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:16.280
along with what fields you want.

79
00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:20.360
Another kind of cool thing is that there is docs for this.

80
00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:22.650
So we could say like, let's look for all products.

81
00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.160
You click that, then it will tell you

82
00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.870
all products, it takes these arguments

83
00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:31.210
so you can filter them or search or sort them or order.

84
00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:32.980
We'll certainly get into all of that

85
00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:35.180
when we do searching and things like that.

86
00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:37.600
And then it tells you what are the possible fields.

87
00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.370
So you get the ID, the name, the status, the description,

88
00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:43.600
the price, and the photo of each of those.

89
00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.820
Okay, let's close that down here.

90
00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:47.690
One kind of other cool thing

91
00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:51.200
is you can do multiple queries in one go.

92
00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:52.520
So we want all the products

93
00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:54.880
but maybe we want all the users.

94
00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:58.210
So it can be the name and the email of that user.

95
00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:59.220
So now I run this

96
00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:01.661
and we get all the products that we wanted

97
00:04:01.661 --> 00:04:02.860
but we also in the same requests

98
00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:07.420
we'll get a list of all of the actual users that we want.

99
00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:10.100
And furthermore, it is relational.

100
00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:13.170
Meaning that if you have data that is related to each other

101
00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:16.960
you can say, give me all the users and give me their cart.

102
00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:20.070
And for each item in their cart

103
00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:24.333
give me the ID and the product, let's run it.

104
00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:26.830
Oh, it's cause product is relationship.

105
00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:27.930
Let's just get the ID.

106
00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:31.440
So a relationship we have here

107
00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:34.820
is a user has a cart which has a relationship

108
00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:37.830
to another piece of data called cart items.

109
00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:40.150
And inside of that cart, it has a relationship

110
00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:45.150
to a product that has a name and a description.

111
00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:46.930
So go ahead and run that.

112
00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:50.240
And now what we've done is we've queried every single user,

113
00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:52.620
their email, what's in their cart

114
00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:56.450
and then for each item in their cart we grab the name

115
00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:59.170
and description and the price of it.

116
00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:04.170
And as long as you set up the relationships

117
00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:08.240
in Keystone or in whatever you're working with,

118
00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:11.430
you're able to write these really slick single queries

119
00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:16.430
that will go and grab just the data that you need

120
00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:18.550
but all in a single request.

121
00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:20.250
So GraphQL is really, really cool.

122
00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:22.130
So that is queries.

123
00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:24.040
There's a whole flip side to that

124
00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:27.050
which is things like mutation.

125
00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:29.320
So a mutation might be as simple

126
00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:31.430
as I need to reset my password.

127
00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:33.990
So you run a mutation called a request reset

128
00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:35.840
and then it return to you something

129
00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:39.190
or updating a specific user.

130
00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:41.800
Here I was updating a password.

131
00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:44.320
And the idea is like, obviously we're gonna hook all this up

132
00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:47.390
to buttons and forms and stuff in our react application

133
00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:49.700
but the whole API is available

134
00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:52.170
via this little playground that you can play with it.

135
00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:54.940
So that's a very high level of what GraphQL is.

136
00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:56.270
We're gonna be using it throughout the rest

137
00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:58.030
of this course and get a little bit more

138
00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:01.440
into the nitty gritty of the different things.

139
00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:03.060
But at a very high level, you need to know that

140
00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:05.490
GraphQL is queries and mutations

141
00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:08.560
that either pull down the data and relational data

142
00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:11.800
that you need or it pushes data to your server

143
00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:15.700
where it then updates or create new products, users,

144
00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:17.800
carte items, things like that.

145
00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:20.660
So that is GraphQL, big fan of it.

146
00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:23.060
It takes a little bit more work to get setup

147
00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:25.660
than a traditional rest API endpoint

148
00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:30.600
but the work is primarily done for us

149
00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:32.230
under the hood with Keystone JS.

150
00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:33.670
And especially if you're taking this course

151
00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:34.510
for the second time

152
00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:36.660
because I have rerecorded it

153
00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:38.960
you'll notice that this is a lot easier

154
00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:41.090
than the way that we did it previously.

155
00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:44.340
And that's just because the ecosystem is maturing

156
00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:45.990
and a lot of the tooling around this

157
00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:47.640
is getting much, much better.

158
00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:49.090
So I'm really excited about it.

159
00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:51.653
Let's jump into the next video and get Keystone going.
