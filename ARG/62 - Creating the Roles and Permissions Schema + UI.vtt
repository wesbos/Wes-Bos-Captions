00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:02.470
<v Instructor>What we're gonna be doing right now</v>

2
00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:05.310
is making the schema type for our role,

3
00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:06.880
because the way that we're gonna manage

4
00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:08.580
who has what role,

5
00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.160
is we can go into the side here

6
00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:11.680
and click on roles,

7
00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:14.310
and then we can both add people to that role

8
00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:17.850
as well as add individual permissions.

9
00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.050
So what we'll do here

10
00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.960
is we'll go into our schema folder

11
00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.773
and make a new file and we'll call that capital Role.ts.

12
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.323
And then in here,

13
00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.130
we'll say export const Role = list,

14
00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:39.460
let's see if we can auto import list from Keystone.

15
00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:41.060
Boom, there it is.

16
00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:44.100
Then inside of that, we have,

17
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.440
we just have fields right now.

18
00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.480
We will have a lot more related to Access Control,

19
00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.000
once we get this up and running.

20
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.410
This is kinda a chicken and the egg here. (chuckles)

21
00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.300
We need to make the roles so we can apply

22
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.710
to who can manage the roles.

23
00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:59.010
Inside of there we have a name field,

24
00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.900
which is a text field from keystone,

25
00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:06.620
that is imported from keystone forward slash fields,

26
00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:09.563
and say isRequired is true,

27
00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:14.750
then underneath that we'll have assignedTo

28
00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.723
that will be a relationship,

29
00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:25.320
that is reference to a User.role,

30
00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:31.010
we'll put a quick little TODO: Add this to the user,

31
00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:32.403
'cause we gotta,

32
00:01:32.403 --> 00:01:36.120
if anytime you do like a two way relationship,

33
00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:37.910
you have to reference,

34
00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:41.623
create the reference on the other item as well.

35
00:01:43.852 --> 00:01:46.410
And also say many is true.

36
00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:47.616
Why?

37
00:01:47.616 --> 00:01:49.640
Because many people can have this specific role.

38
00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.333
And then the ui is itemView,

39
00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:57.030
fieldMode is only gonna be read

40
00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.850
and I'll show you why we do that in just a second.

41
00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.050
So that's the very basics of that.

42
00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:04.270
Let's go ahead and create the role field

43
00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:05.610
on our user as well.

44
00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.170
So open up our user in the schema folder

45
00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:11.860
and we will go right below orders

46
00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:15.713
and we'll add a new field which is called role.

47
00:02:17.615 --> 00:02:18.448
And that is again,

48
00:02:18.448 --> 00:02:22.710
a relationship with a reference to

49
00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:24.363
the Role.assignedTo,

50
00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.983
let's just triple check we got that capital T on there.

51
00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:33.140
Yeah, assignedTo is equal to Role.assignedTo.

52
00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:34.300
Okay, good.

53
00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:35.200
Also along with that,

54
00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:40.200
we'll need a TODO: Add Access Control,

55
00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:42.980
once we have it up and running.

56
00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.450
All right, so we just went ahead and created our role here.

57
00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.540
Now we can go into our,

58
00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.270
I believe it's our keystone.ts

59
00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:54.230
and where we create all of our schemas,

60
00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.703
we will also put a new one called Role,

61
00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:02.080
that should have auto imported from our schema file, good.

62
00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.140
And then we'll just give a quick restart

63
00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:09.140
of our backend and we should see the role showing up.

64
00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:12.210
While that's happening,

65
00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:15.790
we're gonna need a bunch of additional fields

66
00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:20.470
on here that are going to be our actual permissions.

67
00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:23.670
And this is just gonna be a lot of typing,

68
00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:25.540
so what I'm gonna get you to do is to go

69
00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:29.820
and grab this file from the finished files folder.

70
00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:31.450
Just because again,

71
00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:34.290
this is not typing practice so real quick,

72
00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:36.800
you can see here now we have roles here

73
00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:38.510
and you can create a role

74
00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:41.780
and you can basically say like

75
00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:45.200
we can make this an admin role and assign it to Wes

76
00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:49.360
but there is no additional check boxes

77
00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:51.650
for what sort of permissions they have.

78
00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:53.113
So we're gonna do that now.

79
00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:57.370
So go to the finished files and grab the file

80
00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:02.250
in the backend schemas folder called field.ts

81
00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:03.810 line:15% 
or fields.ts.

82
00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:05.850 line:15% 
And I'm gonna go ahead and make it myself here,

83
00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:06.793 line:15% 
new file,

84
00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:10.223 line:15% 
this one is lowercase fields.ts.

85
00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:13.640 line:15% 
And inside of that,

86
00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:14.610
we just have this code.

87
00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:16.960
So again, go and grab this from the finished files.

88
00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:19.360
I'm gonna explain it to you real quickly.

89
00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:21.750
Here we are just making a bunch

90
00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:24.060
of different permissions fields

91
00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:26.890
for things that the user may or may not be able to do.

92
00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:28.630
So can they manage the product?

93
00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:29.880
Can they see other users?

94
00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:31.040
Can they manage users?

95
00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:32.100
Can they manage roles?

96
00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:33.720
Can they manage the cart?

97
00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.233
Can they manage orders?

98
00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:39.360
And then each of those will have a default value of false

99
00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.330
as well as a label that gives us a bit more

100
00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:44.250
of a description as to what this thing is.

101
00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:46.427
Finally, we're just generating some custom types here

102
00:04:46.427 --> 00:04:51.030
and a list of all of the permissions, which is canManage.

103
00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:54.650
And we'll go into why we did that in just a sec as well.

104
00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:57.100
What we do now is we need to import all

105
00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:01.030
of these permission fields into our role here

106
00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:03.050
and the reason why I'm not putting it,

107
00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:05.610
I'm just not directly putting it in this file is

108
00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:09.550
because we also want to reference these lists of fields

109
00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:11.130
in a couple other files.

110
00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:13.500
And by putting it in its own file,

111
00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:16.530
make sure that we don't have circular dependency issue.

112
00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:19.640
So we'll go into our top here,

113
00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:22.363
and what we do is just ...permissionFields,

114
00:05:25.219 --> 00:05:28.550
and we should be able to auto import that permissionFields

115
00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:32.180
from our fields folder or our file.

116
00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:33.730
And yeah, we're in good shape there.

117
00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:35.360
So what that will do is it basically

118
00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:39.230
is just taking all of these copy

119
00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:41.210
and pasting it in right here.

120
00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:45.270
The fact that it did it in between doesn't really matter

121
00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:47.360
but it's basically just adding them all in here

122
00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:50.000
programmatically with a spread.

123
00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.400
So now for your restart that sucker,

124
00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:55.000
we should see the ability

125
00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.840
to add different roles

126
00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:59.433
to this specific user.

127
00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:02.603
So here we go,

128
00:06:02.603 --> 00:06:04.164
we'll create a role,

129
00:06:04.164 --> 00:06:05.630
there we go, admin,

130
00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:07.110
and then we'll say user can update

131
00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:08.520
and delete any product,

132
00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:09.353
user can query,

133
00:06:09.353 --> 00:06:10.186
so in our case,

134
00:06:10.186 --> 00:06:13.890
we're going to check box all

135
00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:16.150
of these and then go ahead

136
00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:17.880
and assign it to me,

137
00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:19.370
and click on Create Role.

138
00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:22.610
You can additionally go to a specific user,

139
00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:24.260
and edit that user

140
00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:25.670
and you should be able to select

141
00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:27.890
from a list of roles on there.

142
00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:32.040
So again, a role is going to be a,

143
00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:36.100
let's go back to my crude layout here,

144
00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:39.170
permissions, those are the check boxes that we've created,

145
00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:43.330
then our role is going to be a collection of permissions

146
00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:46.070
that we sort of sweep into one like,

147
00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:50.310
one sort of giant role called can manageUser,

148
00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:52.100
and then what we're gonna do

149
00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:55.020
in the future is we're going to start working

150
00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:57.380
on these access functions,

151
00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:00.280
which will go into each of our schemas

152
00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:03.143
and decide whether or not we can do something.
