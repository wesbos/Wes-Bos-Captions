00:00:00.063 --> 00:00:01.576
(swooshing music)

2
00:00:01.576 --> 00:00:03.290
<v Instructor>All right now that we've got the items</v>

3
00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:06.050
being removed from the cart, we need to now update the UI.

4
00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:07.670
Now there's kind of like a couple options

5
00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:08.503
we could have here.

6
00:00:08.503 --> 00:00:11.900
We could pass a re fetch queries to this and say,

7
00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:13.310
all right, when you delete the item,

8
00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:17.730
make sure you go and re fetch all of the users cart

9
00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.470
and we can re render it

10
00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.110
but a little bit faster than that.

11
00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:23.630
So we don't need to make a second trip to the server

12
00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.080
is simply just a pop that item out of the cache

13
00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:27.760
or to evict it from cache.

14
00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:31.080
So what we do is you pass it an update function.

15
00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.003
And I usually like to put my functions up here called,

16
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.920
I like to put them outside update

17
00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:38.070
because the things that you need

18
00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.590
are the cache and the payload

19
00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.950
that get passed in when that function is running.

20
00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:48.920
So it's not necessary to be inside of the component itself.

21
00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.920
So when somebody removes an item from the cache

22
00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:58.340
and it comes back, it's going to run the update

23
00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:00.130
and it's gonna give us both access

24
00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:03.850
to the entire Apollo cache as well as the information

25
00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:05.350
that came back from the API

26
00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:08.530
which in our case is just gonna be ID.

27
00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:09.700
So it's actually a really simple,

28
00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.560
we just run cache.evict,

29
00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.760
and then we need to identify the item.

30
00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.630
Normally you could just say like cart, item, six,

31
00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.190
whatever, whatever, whatever.

32
00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:22.810
And that's what it's using to evict the item.

33
00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:27.303
But it's better to use the cache to identify API

34
00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:31.390
because it will generate these IDs for you.

35
00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.223
So we can say cache.identify,

36
00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.490
and then you pass it the payload.data.delete cart item.

37
00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.500
So that is this thing that's gonna be passed back.

38
00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.190
It's both going to have an ID

39
00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:48.380
as well as every response will have

40
00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.880
an underscore underscore type name passed along with it.

41
00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.850
It's not something you have to request explicitly

42
00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.630
from the API, it will just give it to you.

43
00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.140
So with that in place now,

44
00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:01.830
I believe we should be able to click it.

45
00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:03.680
And when that comes back from the API

46
00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.930
it then remove the item from our list.

47
00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.960
There is one more step that you could take

48
00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:10.660
to make that even faster.

49
00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.720
And that's a concept of an optimistic response.

50
00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.337
And an optimistic response will say,

51
00:02:15.337 --> 00:02:18.077
"Okay, I pretty sure I know what's gonna come back

52
00:02:18.077 --> 00:02:21.437
"from the server, so what I'm gonna do is immediately

53
00:02:21.437 --> 00:02:23.527
"give you sort of a fake response

54
00:02:23.527 --> 00:02:25.877
"that will match what the server will give me."

55
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.270
And then if the server comes back

56
00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:29.960
with something different we can roll that back,

57
00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:32.970
but it looks like this optimistic response.

58
00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.270
And right now I'm not sure why,

59
00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:38.270
but this is not working in correlation with the evict

60
00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:40.990
and I'll show you what the problem is.

61
00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:43.570
And if I find a solution to this,

62
00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:45.430
I'll be sure to tack it on to this video,

63
00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:48.550
but basically the optimistic responses, what comes back,

64
00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:51.900
well, we are expecting it to return

65
00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.940
a delete cart item object.

66
00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.650
And on that we are expecting a underscore underscore

67
00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:00.590
type name to be a cart item.

68
00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:05.590
And we are expecting the ID of the item to be,

69
00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:08.160
the ID of the cart item that's passed in right here.

70
00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:09.670
So we can just put that there.

71
00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:13.170
And what will happen is this updater function

72
00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.550
will run immediately once you press that button

73
00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:18.700
with the optimistic response

74
00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.870
and then it will run a second time

75
00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:25.520
when it actually comes back from the API.

76
00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:28.420
And if those values are any different, it will roll it back.

77
00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:30.300
But in our case, it will just run it twice.

78
00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.660
And the second time it's, there's no,

79
00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:34.250
there will be no item of that ID.

80
00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:38.430
So it will, it'll just, it would just ignore it.

81
00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:41.030
So that is how it's supposed to work.

82
00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:42.650
It's not working right now.

83
00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:45.380
Watch (beep) for some reason,

84
00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:48.140
it's getting totally unrelated,

85
00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:50.800
data to all products is not defined.

86
00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:53.800
And I did dig into this and for a split second data

87
00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:58.150
is undefined and those loading and error states are not,

88
00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:59.750
don't have any values in them.

89
00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:03.403
I did look a little bit deeper and to my network tab.

90
00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:09.470
When this happens, and you can add an item to your cart.

91
00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:11.480
You can look at your car and you can delete it.

92
00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:13.590
And when you delete an item

93
00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:15.580
and all of the items that are JSON in here,

94
00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:17.230
and if I went and fixed that,

95
00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:19.970
like I checked if data was undefined or whatever,

96
00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:21.250
it looks like it's re fetching

97
00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:22.910
every single query on the page.

98
00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:24.730
So all the products, all the pagination,

99
00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:27.500
the user and everything, and I'm not sure why it would

100
00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.750
because the whole point of updater function

101
00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:31.590
is to not have to re fetch the query.

102
00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:34.940
So unfortunately, I will comment this out for now

103
00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:37.910
just because there's an issue with it.

104
00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:41.270
And I will tack onto this video if I do find a solution.

105
00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:43.430
And if you wanna dig into it as well,

106
00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:45.560
by all means, please, please shoot me an email.

107
00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:48.280
But in our case that cache out evict

108
00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.380
is a pretty fast turnaround.

109
00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:52.660
It only takes a couple of milliseconds

110
00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:54.230
from the server and back

111
00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:56.590
because we are just sending very small payloads

112
00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:59.630
of a couple pieces of texts with the ID.

113
00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:02.230
That's it for this one, let's catch in the next one.
