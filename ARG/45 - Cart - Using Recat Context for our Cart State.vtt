00:00:00.115 --> 00:00:01.486
(whooshing)

2
00:00:01.486 --> 00:00:02.440
<v Instructor>All right, this video's gonna be</v>

3
00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:05.340
about local state and context in React.

4
00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:08.260
So let's just understand what those are real quick.

5
00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:10.630
So local state in a React application

6
00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:13.710
is state that exists just inside of the browser.

7
00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.950
A lot of our state so far exists in the database

8
00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:19.140
and it gets sent over.

9
00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.687
And we have done a little bit of local state

10
00:00:20.687 --> 00:00:22.600
and that is when we use our forms

11
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.040
and you type into those input boxes,

12
00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:27.910
that stuff is mirrored to state and it's only there

13
00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:30.190
until you actually send it off to the backend.

14
00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:32.930
Another piece of local state that we need is this cart needs

15
00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:35.090
to be either open or closed.

16
00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:37.340
It's probably the most imply local state ever,

17
00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:38.890
which is just gonna be is it open?

18
00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:41.177
Yes or no? True or false?

19
00:00:41.177 --> 00:00:45.740
And that state needs to be changed

20
00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:48.170
in a number of different places, right?

21
00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:50.510
Like right now, I need to be able

22
00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.290
to close the cart when I'm in the cart itself.

23
00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:55.885
But then I need to be able to open the cart

24
00:00:55.885 --> 00:00:57.580
when the cart is closed.

25
00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:59.830
So there can't be a button inside the cart to open it.

26
00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:01.270
And so we wanna put like maybe a button

27
00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:02.600
in our navigation

28
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.550
or maybe you also want it to open the cart

29
00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:08.670
when somebody adds an item to their cart, right?

30
00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.740
So you can show them that it's in here.

31
00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.410
So when you click on the add to cart.

32
00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:17.410
So in that case, the piece of state needs to exist

33
00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.260
in the cart but the updater function

34
00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.970
that will turn the cart open Boolean to true or false,

35
00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.690
that needs to exist wherever we want it in our application.

36
00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:31.448
So with that functionality,

37
00:01:31.448 --> 00:01:35.350
you generally in React need to define that functionality

38
00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:38.350
at a very high level and then you can pass it down

39
00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:42.330
because if I go into my header right here

40
00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:45.330
and I define that functionality inside of this cart,

41
00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:46.770
there's no way for me to get

42
00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.530
that functionality up a couple levels,

43
00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.210
over a couple levels to the actual page,

44
00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:57.110
down a couple levels to maybe this product component

45
00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:58.490
and then get it in there.

46
00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:02.420
So what we do with local state

47
00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.210
is we put it in what's called context.

48
00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:10.000
And context in React allows us to define data,

49
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.270
which is local state or really anything

50
00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:15.849
and functionality, which is updater functions,

51
00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:18.100
at a very high level.

52
00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.760
In our case, it's gonna be at the top of our application.

53
00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.117
And then you can access that data and functionality

54
00:02:24.117 --> 00:02:27.280
at much lower levels without having

55
00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.330
to pass it down via props

56
00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.710
like we normally would pass data in.

57
00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:33.940
Passing via props is a great way to get data

58
00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:35.920
and functionality into a component

59
00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.760
but it's really hard to do that

60
00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.220
when your component is say seven or eight levels deep.

61
00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:43.830
You have to pass it down all the way.

62
00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:47.114
So that's exactly what we're gonna be doing right now.

63
00:02:47.114 --> 00:02:49.340
And we're going to be doing that

64
00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.000
in a file called cartState.

65
00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.740
So we can stick that either in a,

66
00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:58.690
it is technically going to be both a component,

67
00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:00.010
which is a provider

68
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.900
and it's going to be a custom hook as well.

69
00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.410
So we can stick that into components

70
00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:08.450
but to me it seems more like a lib thing.

71
00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:10.340
It's more just custom JavaScript.

72
00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.040
So we'll put it in there.

73
00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.817 line:15% 
And we're going to call that cartState.

74
00:03:16.365 --> 00:03:18.203 line:15% 
cartState.js.

75
00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:21.920 line:15% 
So there's gonna be two parts to creating our cartState.

76
00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.137
We have one thing that's called a provider

77
00:03:24.137 --> 00:03:27.000
and the provider's gonna live at a high level

78
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.060
in your application.

79
00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:32.370
And the provider will store things like pieces of states,

80
00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:34.120
as well as updater functions.

81
00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.437
And then in order to access those pieces of states

82
00:03:36.437 --> 00:03:39.370
and updater functions anywhere else in your application,

83
00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:40.920
you call a consumer.

84
00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:44.000
And the consumer is able to talk to the provider

85
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.420
and get those things from the provider

86
00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:48.740
without having a direct link to them.

87
00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:51.210
So it sort of just floats through the air

88
00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:52.670
and they somehow can talk to each other

89
00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:55.660 line:15% 
without having to have props or something like that.

90
00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:57.920 line:15% 
So we are going to make our own provider

91
00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:59.570 line:15% 
called the cartState provider

92
00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:00.960
that has all that data in it.

93
00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:03.150
So first thing is we need to create a context.

94
00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.510
So I'll say const LocalStateContext

95
00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:08.267
is equal to createContext

96
00:04:09.507 --> 00:04:12.080
and createContext is a method that is in React.

97
00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:13.890
So I'll just go ahead and import that.

98
00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:15.050
There we go.

99
00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:18.500
And then we also wanna put the LocalStateProvider

100
00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:20.110
in its own variable as well.

101
00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:24.400
So I'll stay const LocalStateProvider

102
00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:26.680
is equal to LocalStateContext dot

103
00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:28.677
and look, you can see there's a Provider

104
00:04:28.677 --> 00:04:31.322
and a Consumer, so we want the Provider here.

105
00:04:31.322 --> 00:04:33.600
This variable is not necessary

106
00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:36.140
because you can just use that as a tag

107
00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:39.110
but people get confused when there's dots inside of a tag.

108
00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:41.700
So I like to put it in its own variable.

109
00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:44.920
Next up, what we wanna do is to make a function

110
00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:46.780
called CartStateProvider

111
00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:50.993
that takes in one prop, which is children.

112
00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:53.920
And then inside of here,

113
00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:58.403
we're going to say this is our own custom provider.

114
00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:05.750
We will store data,

115
00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:07.280
which is state

116
00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:14.150
and functionality, like updaters in here

117
00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:17.400
and anyone can access it

118
00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:20.663
via the consumer.

119
00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:29.010
So let's do a really simple value here.

120
00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:33.600
We'll just say const cartOpen is equal to true.

121
00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:34.630
Right?

122
00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:37.160
And then from this CartStateProvider,

123
00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:41.103
we'll return our LocalStateProvider

124
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.050
and in the middle of that, you simply just put children.

125
00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:50.950
Now, here is how you take data

126
00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:53.810
and sort of open it up to the world

127
00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:55.720
so other people can consume it.

128
00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:57.680
We say value is equal to,

129
00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:01.630
and any value that gets passed to your provider here

130
00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:05.290
will then be accessible anywhere else in your application.

131
00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:09.100
So you could pass just like a straight up number here

132
00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:11.670
if you wanted but if you need to pass multiple things,

133
00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:12.880
you have to pass an object.

134
00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:15.600
So double set of curly brackets here.

135
00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:19.130
And we wanna pass the cartOpen variable

136
00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:20.640
that we have created.

137
00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:25.640
Finally, what we'll do is you export the CartStateProvider

138
00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:33.360
and we'll have to add a couple more things.

139
00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:35.660
That's the very basic of creating a provider.

140
00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:37.270
Now, what you do with this provider

141
00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:39.560
is you stick somewhere in a high level

142
00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:41.580
of your application and most likely,

143
00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:45.320
that's gonna be in your _app.js

144
00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:48.370
or it's gonna be in your like page.js.

145
00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:50.410
Likely we'll put it in our app.js

146
00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:51.520
and the reason we do that

147
00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:53.520
is so that this data will persist

148
00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:56.650
from page to page without resetting itself

149
00:06:56.650 --> 00:06:58.100
every time we change the page.

150
00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:01.580
So look, we already have a provider in here

151
00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:03.300
and that's the ApolloProvider, right?

152
00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:06.040
Because the data for Apollo lives at a very high level.

153
00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:10.320
So we wanna go ahead and add in our own provider as well.

154
00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:13.460
So you can put it inside or above.

155
00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:14.950
It doesn't matter in this case

156
00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:18.160
but we're gonna go ahead and say CartStateProvider.

157
00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:20.020
So we wrap it and then go ahead

158
00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:22.343
and import that sucker.

159
00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:24.930
There we go.

160
00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:29.533
Now, I believe if we open up our Dev Tools here for React,

161
00:07:32.066 --> 00:07:34.820
we should see, there we go, CartStateProvider.

162
00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:37.260
It doesn't actually show us that data just yet

163
00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:39.550
but if we wanna be able to access that data,

164
00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:41.070
we will write a custom hook.

165
00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:43.560
So let's go ahead and do that now.

166
00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:46.390
We'll go back to our cartState here

167
00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:49.610
and we'll make a custom hook for accessing the cart.

168
00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:54.610
So make a custom hook for accessing the cart local state.

169
00:07:58.766 --> 00:08:00.377
This'll say function useCart

170
00:08:02.669 --> 00:08:05.780
and this is gonna be a very, very simple hook.

171
00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:09.080
Basically what we do is we say const all

172
00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:12.340
is equal to useContext LocalStateContext

173
00:08:15.055 --> 00:08:16.130
and then we return all.

174
00:08:16.130 --> 00:08:17.670
So what just happened there?

175
00:08:17.670 --> 00:08:18.623
Well, useContext is,

176
00:08:20.130 --> 00:08:22.503
we need to make sure we're importing that,

177
00:08:25.016 --> 00:08:25.849
there we go.

178
00:08:25.849 --> 00:08:28.230
useContext is the consumer end of it.

179
00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:31.170
Remember, we have our provider and we have our consumer.

180
00:08:31.170 --> 00:08:35.590
We use a consumer here

181
00:08:35.590 --> 00:08:38.330
to access the local state

182
00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:43.150
and the reason why we put this into its own custom hook

183
00:08:43.150 --> 00:08:45.830
is simply so that when you want to be able

184
00:08:45.830 --> 00:08:47.310
to access the cart data,

185
00:08:47.310 --> 00:08:49.680
you don't have to both import useContext

186
00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:51.400
and the context itself,

187
00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:53.750
we can simply just use this nice little hook

188
00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:57.520
and it will internally access these values for us,

189
00:08:57.520 --> 00:08:58.870
which is really slick.

190
00:08:58.870 --> 00:09:01.570
So this cart here, now we can go ahead

191
00:09:01.570 --> 00:09:04.953
and export that useCart value.

192
00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:08.740
Now we can go anywhere in our application

193
00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:11.140
and get access to that data.

194
00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:13.683
So let's go back into our cart here.

195
00:09:14.830 --> 00:09:17.710
And right below useUser, we'll say const,

196
00:09:17.710 --> 00:09:20.800
just call it data is equal to useCart.

197
00:09:23.550 --> 00:09:24.383
Boom.

198
00:09:25.930 --> 00:09:28.853
And then just console.log data.

199
00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:33.133
Now I refresh.

200
00:09:35.010 --> 00:09:36.760
We've got a lot of consol.logs

201
00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:38.820
we should probably get rid of right here

202
00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:41.360
but you see, the first thing that logs

203
00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:45.380
is this cartOpen is equal to true value.

204
00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:49.910
So what we did is we defined our CartState here

205
00:09:49.910 --> 00:09:51.563
at a very high level.

206
00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:55.840
And then we can use it anywhere we want

207
00:09:55.840 --> 00:10:00.230
by simply saying useCart, right?

208
00:10:00.230 --> 00:10:02.610
And then we can take that data

209
00:10:02.610 --> 00:10:06.233
and let's destructure it now into cartOpen.

210
00:10:07.890 --> 00:10:09.430
Get rid of that console.log.

211
00:10:09.430 --> 00:10:13.593
We can pass that cartOpen value to this.

212
00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:18.860
And now we should be able to go in here

213
00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:20.513
and just make that false.

214
00:10:22.957 --> 00:10:23.910
And you see it's hidden, right?

215
00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:28.600
True, it's shown, false, it closes itself.

216
00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:30.410
So what we can now do

217
00:10:30.410 --> 00:10:33.630
is not just expose this cartOpen variable

218
00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:36.170
but we can also expose any other functions

219
00:10:36.170 --> 00:10:38.370
that will change this variable from true to false.

220
00:10:38.370 --> 00:10:40.780
So we don't actually wanna make this a straight up variable.

221
00:10:40.780 --> 00:10:42.940
This should actually live in a piece of state.

222
00:10:42.940 --> 00:10:45.540
So what we'll do is we'll get rid of that

223
00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:48.090
and I'm going say const, square bracket,

224
00:10:48.090 --> 00:10:49.813
cartOpen and setCartOpen

225
00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:53.620
is equal to useState

226
00:10:55.570 --> 00:10:57.810
and the default is gonna be false, right?

227
00:10:57.810 --> 00:11:00.450
By default, the cart will be closed.

228
00:11:00.450 --> 00:11:04.090
Now we need to import useState from React, good.

229
00:11:07.530 --> 00:11:12.530
And we also want to expose this setCartOpen function

230
00:11:13.810 --> 00:11:14.800
to our local state.

231
00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:15.690
So anyone that wants

232
00:11:15.690 --> 00:11:19.880
to explicitly set the cart open, totally can.

233
00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:22.790
Also, you can create little helper functions, like this.

234
00:11:22.790 --> 00:11:24.440
Function toggleCart.

235
00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:30.103
We'll simply setCartOpen to be whatever the opposite

236
00:11:30.103 --> 00:11:33.120
of the current cartOpen Boolean is.

237
00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:35.590
So the bang, bang in JavaScript

238
00:11:35.590 --> 00:11:37.440
will just give us the opposite of true or false.

239
00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:39.940
So if a cartOpen is true, then it is false.

240
00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:41.480
If it's false, it is true.

241
00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:42.600
You can make another one.

242
00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:44.840
Function called closeCart.

243
00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:46.490
So if you wanna explicitly closeCart,

244
00:11:46.490 --> 00:11:48.340
whether it's open or closed,

245
00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:49.910
you just wanna make sure that it's closed,

246
00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:54.170
you say setCartOpen false.

247
00:11:54.170 --> 00:11:57.360
And then you can have another one, which is openCart

248
00:11:58.300 --> 00:11:59.870
and that will be true.

249
00:11:59.870 --> 00:12:02.030
And obviously, these are just very, very simple

250
00:12:02.030 --> 00:12:04.580
but you could see how you might have a lot more logic

251
00:12:04.580 --> 00:12:06.600
inside of these little helper function

252
00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:08.440
that you can simply now take them

253
00:12:09.620 --> 00:12:13.327
and expose them to your LocalStateProvider.

254
00:12:18.170 --> 00:12:20.300
And I can go back into my cart now

255
00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:27.440
and we can have a button that will close it.

256
00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:28.923
So we'll say go here.

257
00:12:30.350 --> 00:12:31.647
Let's say closeCart.

258
00:12:33.490 --> 00:12:35.973
And we can give ourselves a little button.

259
00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:41.607
I'll say right here onClick is equal to closeCart.

260
00:12:45.237 --> 00:12:46.163
&amp;times.

261
00:12:49.050 --> 00:12:51.760
And I guess we need to default the cart to be open right now

262
00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:54.330
'cause we don't have an open button just yet.

263
00:12:54.330 --> 00:12:56.483
So let's just default that to be open.

264
00:12:58.612 --> 00:13:00.470
There we go, and see there's a little button right there

265
00:13:00.470 --> 00:13:01.883
and as soon as I click it,

266
00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:06.530
it flips that variable and then our CSS kicks in

267
00:13:06.530 --> 00:13:08.370
and close the whole thing for us.

268
00:13:08.370 --> 00:13:11.930
So there's that and then we also should have a button

269
00:13:11.930 --> 00:13:13.890
that will open the cart for us.

270
00:13:13.890 --> 00:13:15.780
So where do we wanna open it?

271
00:13:15.780 --> 00:13:17.460
Well, let's go to our nav

272
00:13:17.460 --> 00:13:19.520
and right below our SignOut button,

273
00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:21.920
let's just give ourselves another button

274
00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:24.770
that has a type of button

275
00:13:26.270 --> 00:13:29.070
and that should just say My Cart

276
00:13:31.250 --> 00:13:34.010
and when somebody clicks that, we wanna open it, right?

277
00:13:34.010 --> 00:13:37.150
So okay, now we're not in the cart anymore,

278
00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:38.190
we're in the nav.

279
00:13:38.190 --> 00:13:39.200
How do we open the cart?

280
00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:44.200
Well, go up here, const openCart is equal to useCart.

281
00:13:48.250 --> 00:13:51.060
Boom, now we have that functionality available anywhere.

282
00:13:51.060 --> 00:13:53.120
You see how you can just use this functionality

283
00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:54.190
wherever you want?

284
00:13:54.190 --> 00:13:58.288
And we can link it up onClick of this button.

285
00:13:58.288 --> 00:13:59.610
openCart.

286
00:13:59.610 --> 00:14:01.820
Now I think I should be able to click this.

287
00:14:01.820 --> 00:14:03.120
Boom, opens it.

288
00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:05.340
This one, boom, closes it.

289
00:14:05.340 --> 00:14:07.380
On, off, on, off.

290
00:14:07.380 --> 00:14:12.210
Last thing I think we need to do is to make sure

291
00:14:12.210 --> 00:14:15.850
that that default value is false

292
00:14:15.850 --> 00:14:18.263
'cause we want it to be closed by default.

293
00:14:22.410 --> 00:14:23.243
Good.

294
00:14:23.243 --> 00:14:25.290
And then I believe there's a little bit of styling we need

295
00:14:25.290 --> 00:14:27.393
to do to close this cart here.

296
00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:32.800
Let's go back to our cart here and tick this button.

297
00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:36.200
That button goes inside of the header

298
00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:40.113
and I believe I have a CloseButton component.

299
00:14:41.390 --> 00:14:42.860
Some styles for you.

300
00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:44.230
Let's try to auto import that.

301
00:14:44.230 --> 00:14:48.404
No, but we can import it from here.

302
00:14:48.404 --> 00:14:49.404
CloseButton.

303
00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:54.823
Did I type it wrong?

304
00:14:57.520 --> 00:14:58.353
Yeah.

305
00:15:01.290 --> 00:15:02.750
Ah, there we go.

306
00:15:02.750 --> 00:15:03.980
Look at that nice little button.

307
00:15:03.980 --> 00:15:06.412
Open, close, open, close.

308
00:15:06.412 --> 00:15:09.820
We should, let's get rid of some of these console.logs

309
00:15:09.820 --> 00:15:10.670
before we end here.

310
00:15:10.670 --> 00:15:12.243
So cart.js.

311
00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:15.893
Console.log, I get rid of that product.

312
00:15:17.380 --> 00:15:19.833
Console.log me, let's get rid of that.

313
00:15:20.740 --> 00:15:21.963
Refresh the page.

314
00:15:23.020 --> 00:15:26.763
Let's go to products.js, get rid of that console.log.

315
00:15:31.210 --> 00:15:32.113
Products.

316
00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:35.753
Yeah, there we go.

317
00:15:35.753 --> 00:15:37.790
Too much, too many console.logs.

318
00:15:37.790 --> 00:15:39.863
Make sure you clean up after yourself.

319
00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:42.173
Beautiful.

320
00:15:42.173 --> 00:15:44.200
So that is LocalStateContext.

321
00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:46.070
I really like using LocalStateContext

322
00:15:46.070 --> 00:15:49.370
'cause you can store the data anywhere you want

323
00:15:49.370 --> 00:15:51.896
and then be able to access it at any lower level.

324
00:15:51.896 --> 00:15:53.747
See you in the next one.
