(logo whooshing)

2
00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:03.310
<v Instructor>All right, we've got a little bit</v>

3
00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:06.350
of a bug with our useForm hook that we've written here.

4
00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:11.350
And this is one of my least favorite parts of React.

5
00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:15.400
And it has to do with initial data.

6
00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.100
So, we wrote this useForm hook

7
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.610
and if we open up our useForm hook.

8
00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:24.070
What we do here is we take in our initial value.

9
00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:26.800
And when we create our initial state,

10
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.250
we pass it our initial value.

11
00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.370
And in our case for creating a product,

12
00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:35.613
we just hard-coded the name, price, description, right?

13
00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.730
However, with the update function, the initial state must be

14
00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.340
like the existing data that we've pulled

15
00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:48.460
in from the database, right?

16
00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:53.460
And when you load the page here, it works just fine.

17
00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:55.640
And that's because the initial load

18
00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.400
of that is happening on the server.

19
00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.240
And there is no loading state on the server.

20
00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:02.530
The server simply just waits for the data to come back

21
00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:04.230
from our graph QL API.

22
00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:07.000
However, on the Client, there is a loading state.

23
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.210
So, you have the sort of like

24
00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.880
you load the component, it loads for a quick second.

25
00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.650
And then it gets the data back and then it runs it.

26
00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:20.650
So, you might be thinking, "Okay, well, Wes,

27
00:01:20.707 --> 00:01:25.707
"you just need to wait for the data to come back

28
00:01:26.457 --> 00:01:28.207
"from the single product,

29
00:01:28.207 --> 00:01:30.350
"before you can pass it to useForm."

30
00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:31.660
And we actually...

31
00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:32.650
I actually just tried that.

32
00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:37.650
I just said, if it's loading then return P loading, right?

33
00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.180
And the error that we get from that is that...

34
00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.480
Here, let's take a look at what it is.

35
00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:45.870
So, now we don't get it here

36
00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:47.470
because there was no loading state.

37
00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:51.450
But if you go to another one that gets...

38
00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.150
Like right here, edit, we get the problem.

39
00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:58.930
Rendered more hooks than the previous render,

40
00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:01.300
is if you have...

41
00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:06.050
The hooks must always be rendered every single time

42
00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.883
that happens.

43
00:02:06.883 --> 00:02:08.300
So, if it first renders

44
00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.900
and this is all it's loading and just returns to this

45
00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:12.580
and then loading is no longer false,

46
00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.260
so it creates some more hooks.

47
00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.940
For some reason, React, doesn't like that, I'm not sure why.

48
00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.690
There's probably some complicated deep down thing.

49
00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.100
That is the reason behind that, but that becomes a bit

50
00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.290
of a problem for us because we don't wanna create

51
00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.703
the useForm until we have the data.

52
00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:33.230
So, what we need to do is go into our useForm.

53
00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.210
The solution is pretty, pretty simple.

54
00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:36.570
It's just understanding the problem.

55
00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:41.380
I think it's probably the harder part is that we need to go

56
00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:46.050
into our form and say, when the initial data changes,

57
00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:48.880
like we go from loading to actually having the data,

58
00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.890
then we need to update it.

59
00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:54.462
And the way that you do that is with useEffect.

60
00:02:54.462 --> 00:02:58.450
useEffect will allow us to monitor pieces of state

61
00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:00.280
or monitor variables.

62
00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.660
And when those variables change, we can run some code.

63
00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:08.200
And that's helpful for a whole bunch of stuff, if you're...

64
00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.180
Maybe if you were subscribing to a database

65
00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.100
and you needed to send some data off when a change happens.

66
00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:19.050
But in our case, when the undefined initial state

67
00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:23.410
of loading path changes to an actual object full of data,

68
00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:24.630
then we need to update it.

69
00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:28.830
So, we'll say useEffect here and whew!

70
00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:32.250
Let's not use the boiler plate for that.

71
00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:36.700
Make sure we import useEffect from React, okay?

72
00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:40.520
And then useEffect takes, first thing is,

73
00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:42.820
a function that will run.

74
00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:46.920
So, it we'll just say console log.

75
00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.910
Not console, we'll just put a comment here.

76
00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:53.910
This function runs when the things we are watching change.

77
00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:58.330
And what are the things we are watching?

78
00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:01.620
Will you pass it in an array of things to watch?

79
00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:03.340
And initially I thought, okay, well,

80
00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:06.010
we'll just, we'll watch for initial to change, right?

81
00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:09.440
Because if the thing that we are thinking is changing

82
00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:12.820
is the initial value that's being passed in,

83
00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:15.470
can we not just wait and watch for initial to be changed?

84
00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:16.969
And when that happens,

85
00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:21.969
we simply just run a set inputs initial, right?

86
00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:27.680
And this will work, but it will cause an infinite loop.

87
00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:31.480
And I'm gonna explain why, because what happens is that

88
00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:34.223
when the initial value initially comes in,

89
00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:37.890
we set it to state, right, right here.

90
00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:40.020
Then when the initial value changes

91
00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:43.120
from that first undefined in loading state to the second,

92
00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:45.823
which is the actual item with the name, the price

93
00:04:45.823 --> 00:04:47.920
and the description on it,

94
00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:50.670
what happens is that it triggers a change.

95
00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:52.470
And then we call set inputs,

96
00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:54.630
which then updates our initial state.

97
00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:57.400
But that changes what initial is,

98
00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:01.110
because useState doesn't just update the object.

99
00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:03.200
It actually overwrites the entire object

100
00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:04.610
to a brand new object.

101
00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:06.240
So, what that does is (chuckles)

102
00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:09.780
it updates state to initial object, which causes a change,

103
00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:11.810
which updates state to initial object,

104
00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:13.140
which causes a change,

105
00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:15.870
which updates state to initial object and causes a change.

106
00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:17.760
And then, and then on and on and on and on

107
00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:20.070
and then that will spin out of control

108
00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:22.290
and crash your dev tools and your browser,

109
00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:23.530
because that's an infinite loop.

110
00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:27.810
So, what we need to do is we need something in here,

111
00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:32.180
that we can watch that will basically be trigger the change.

112
00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:34.620
And what I've come up with here is why don't we just

113
00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:39.620
watch the actual values on the, on the object.

114
00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.730
And when the values on the object go from nothing

115
00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:45.210
like the name, the price, and the description go

116
00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:47.040
from nothing to something,

117
00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:48.480
then we know it's actually changed.

118
00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:52.020
And the reason we do that is we can't necessarily check.

119
00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:54.970
Like we could just pass like initial.name here.

120
00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:57.320
And when the initial.name value changes,

121
00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:59.460
then we know it's changed.

122
00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:03.000
But we don't always know if we're gonna have a name value

123
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.930
on our form.

124
00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:06.010
It might be anything.

125
00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:09.330
So, what we can do here is we just say const initialvalues

126
00:06:10.542 --> 00:06:13.540
is equal to object.values.

127
00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:15.610
And we pass it our initial.

128
00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:18.640
And what that will do is it gives us an array

129
00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:20.800
of our actual object.

130
00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:23.090
So, object., let me show you here.

131
00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:26.130
Object.values.

132
00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:28.253
If we have an object that says name.

133
00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:32.823
That's Wes and age is 100.

134
00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:36.120
That gives us an array of the actual values.

135
00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:38.620
And you may think, "Okay, we'll just pass that here."

136
00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:42.210
And that will be, I think that'll be enough.

137
00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:44.880
Another thing you can do here is just put a .join

138
00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:47.560
on the end, and that will just give you a string.

139
00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:49.280
I think I like that approach best.

140
00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:51.800
So, basically, we're taking all the values

141
00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:53.110
and passing it in.

142
00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:55.540
And when it goes, this will only happen once.

143
00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:59.050
It will go from a string of nothing to a string of

144
00:07:00.898 --> 00:07:02.870
the default values that are coming in,

145
00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:05.450
which is the name, the price and the description.

146
00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:07.770
And then that should give us a value.

147
00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:09.090
I do have an Eastland error,

148
00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:11.450
where it tells us to have an exhaustive dependencies,

149
00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:13.960
but because of this set state issue,

150
00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:17.110
I'm gonna let it slide 'cause I think that's the best work

151
00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:18.510
around for that type of thing.

152
00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:20.563
So now, if we go to our products.

153
00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:25.423
And edit one of them,

154
00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:29.941
you see that the value shows up and that bug is gone.

155
00:07:29.941 --> 00:07:30.841
(mouse clicks)
