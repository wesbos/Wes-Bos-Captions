00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:03.360
<v Wes>All right, next up,</v>

2
00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.680
what we need to do is to make an add to cart button.

3
00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.120
So if we go into our components, make a new file

4
00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:13.320
and we will call it capital A, AddToCart.js.

5
00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.147
And we will export default function, AddToCart

6
00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:28.600
that AddToCart is going to take in the ID of the product

7
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.870
that we wish to add to cart.

8
00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:36.277
And from that, we will return a button with...

9
00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:44.300
I wonder, is there a shortcut to having a button

10
00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:45.593
with the type of button?

11
00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.023
Nope, button with the type of button.

12
00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.800
And inside of there, we'll just say add to cart

13
00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:02.983
and do a shopping cart emoji, shopping, okay.

14
00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:08.230
Next we need a mutation.

15
00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:12.200
So const, Add_To_Cart_mutation.

16
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.753
So you go to GQL,

17
00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.940
import that

18
00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.010
and here I say, mutation, actually, we can just take it.

19
00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:29.150
If you still have your tab open from that

20
00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.540
we can just paste what we got so far

21
00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:36.540
and then modify it a little, call it add to cart mutation

22
00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.350
that takes in an ID with the type of ID that is required.

23
00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:46.810
And then we basically will pass that ID variable here

24
00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:50.130
in place of us hard coding it like we did previously

25
00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.780
and we only need the ID value coming back

26
00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:54.790
we don't need the quantity.

27
00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:56.603
Then we'll go here.

28
00:01:58.008 --> 00:01:59.900
Say const, add to cart.

29
00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:02.513
We're gonna make our mutation add to cart.

30
00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:11.193
And we need the loading variable is equal to use mutation.

31
00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.460
That is our add to cart mutation.

32
00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:20.800
And then the variable that needs to be passed

33
00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:30.163
is the ID and that is just the ID that got passed in.

34
00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.370
All right, so we have this loaded up,

35
00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.011
add to cart mutation here.

36
00:02:35.011 --> 00:02:38.690
The other thing we need to do is,

37
00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:40.100
we'll do the loading state in just a second

38
00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:42.280
make sure we don't forget to do the loading state

39
00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.210
'cause that's kind of important,

40
00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:48.360
but now I believe if we go to our product singular

41
00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:52.150
right alongside, we have our edit, our delete

42
00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:53.690
we should also have an add to cart.

43
00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:58.690
We'll put it in the middle, add to cart button and the ID.

44
00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.593
Is that going to be the product of ID?

45
00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:05.090
Need to import the add to cart button.

46
00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:06.803
Yeah, that auto import worked.

47
00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:10.130
No it didn't.

48
00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:11.543
We'll do it one more time.

49
00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.720
Yes, there we go.

50
00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.563
It imported add to cart, good.

51
00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:19.731
Now, if we go back to our thing,

52
00:03:19.731 --> 00:03:21.740
there we go, add to cart.

53
00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:24.131
So we got the button showing up,

54
00:03:24.131 --> 00:03:25.900
but we need to go one step further

55
00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:28.073
and hook up the click of that.

56
00:03:28.073 --> 00:03:33.073
So on click is equal to add to cart,

57
00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.510
that's the method that or the function that is going to run.

58
00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:39.453
So if we open up our cart now,

59
00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:43.430
you see I've got four things for about 5,100 bucks.

60
00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:48.100
And if I click on it, like nothing happened to the button.

61
00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:50.630
And if I opened this, nothing happened either.

62
00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:53.950
But if I manually refresh the page and open it up

63
00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:57.570
you'll see the Yeti Hondo is now in there

64
00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:01.150
and it's gone up by $34, okay?

65
00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:02.940
So next step we need to do is actually

66
00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:06.190
visually show the user that something is happening.

67
00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:11.190
So what we'll do is, we'll say disabled is equal to loading.

68
00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:19.500
And then also if we are in a loading state,

69
00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:23.437
so say loading and end

70
00:04:23.437 --> 00:04:26.740
and then we'll just tack an ING onto the end there.

71
00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:28.323
So we'll say adding to cart.

72
00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:33.880
Now, when I click on this, see,

73
00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:36.390
just for a split second, we see that something is happening.

74
00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:37.340
Now, if I open it up

75
00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:39.970
there still is only one Yeti Hondo in there.

76
00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:43.270
And that's because we have not re fetched the number

77
00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:44.960
of items in the user's cart.

78
00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:46.530
So we can go back to our mutation

79
00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:50.560
and say re fetch queries is an array

80
00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:53.250
or each query has a query property

81
00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:57.983
and it is the current user query.

82
00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:02.980
I've got to import that from our user component.

83
00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:07.533
So import current user, what is it?

84
00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:11.670
It's a named export.

85
00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:13.823
So why is the auto import not working?

86
00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.363
Let's try it one more time.

87
00:05:18.424 --> 00:05:19.257
There we go.

88
00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:26.657
Okay, now let's open it up, 5,187,

89
00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:30.430
actually no, we've got to manually refresh.

90
00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.100
There we go, 5,323.

91
00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:37.580
And then if I add it, you see that that item

92
00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:40.550
that number has incremented

93
00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:42.560
by one every single time that we have it

94
00:05:43.413 --> 00:05:45.150
and the value immediately updates as well.

95
00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:47.130
Last thing I want to do is be able to display how

96
00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:49.890
many items are in the user's cart in the nav

97
00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:54.083
and we will cover that in the next video.
