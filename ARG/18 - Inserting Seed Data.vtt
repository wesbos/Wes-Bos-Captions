00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.470
(air whooshing)

2
00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:03.600
<v Instructor>We need a whole bunch of data in here,</v>

3
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.130
and I could tell you to click and upload all you want,

4
00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:11.360
but it's worth having seed data for when you're working with

5
00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:13.174
especially I found this all the time

6
00:00:13.174 --> 00:00:16.573
when you're debugging things that delete items,

7
00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:18.530
it gets really frustrating

8
00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:21.700
when you spend all this time to upload like 12 items

9
00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:23.490
and then you debug it and delete them,

10
00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.510
and then your bug is not fixed

11
00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:26.910
but you have no more items to delete

12
00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.140
so you have to add more just to test the deletion mutation.

13
00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.180
So we are going to write a little script

14
00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:34.620
or I've already written a little script for you

15
00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.930
but I'm gonna show you how to hook it up with seed data,

16
00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.760
so if we open up our keystone.ts file

17
00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.950
you'll see that we have our,

18
00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:44.813
where's our database connection?

19
00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.010
Here we go, add data seeding here,

20
00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:49.590
okay, we're gonna do that now,

21
00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.170
so the database has an on the connect function

22
00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:58.720
that we can hook into, and we can just console.log

23
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:04.800
connected to the database and now when we run that,

24
00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.970
kill it and started again

25
00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:11.310
we should see as soon as Keystone connects to the database

26
00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.720
we should see that it logs connected to the database,

27
00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.360
there we go, so that means it's successfully connected

28
00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:18.800
to the database, so what we can do,

29
00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.090
is say once you've connected to the database

30
00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.827
just inject all of these items straight away

31
00:01:23.827 --> 00:01:25.820
into the database, so what we'll do,

32
00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.260
is first we'll mark that as a sync

33
00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.160
and then it also gives us access

34
00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.690
to the entire Keystone value here,

35
00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:38.600
and there is, if you take a look at the folder here,

36
00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.250
I think it's in, where is it?

37
00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:44.390
Lib no seed data in data.ts,

38
00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.850
there's just some very basic data

39
00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.810
that I've put in there for you,

40
00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.980
and then in index.ts, this is a function

41
00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:55.530
that here I can all read,

42
00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:56.990
read through it with you really quickly,

43
00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.150
so it console logs, inserting products,

44
00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:04.320
we are grabbing the Keystone MongooseAdapter

45
00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.780
and we're injecting this straight into the database

46
00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.290
and we're not using GraphQL or anything like that,

47
00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:10.730
so if you're using a different database

48
00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:12.310
you might have to adapt that,

49
00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.370
then we do is loop over every single product

50
00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.210
that's in our products

51
00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:20.520
and then we simply just take the product image,

52
00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:21.530
create the image,

53
00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.326
and then create the product for that, right?

54
00:02:24.326 --> 00:02:26.600
We're doing the relationships here,

55
00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.170
then we're done and we exit and we can start it again.

56
00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:35.170
So we can go back to our Keystone here and we will await,

57
00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.293
it's called insert seed data

58
00:02:39.293 --> 00:02:42.233
and we'll have to auto import that sucker,

59
00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:44.483
it didn't work, did it?

60
00:02:46.155 --> 00:02:47.890
Well, that worked, that worked,

61
00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:52.570
why is it telling us expected an argument Keystone

62
00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:53.920
was not provided, oh yeah,

63
00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.330
we forgot to pass the argument Keystone,

64
00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.670
there we go, thank you, TypeScript,

65
00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:00.707
there's another real benefit of using TypeScript,

66
00:03:00.707 --> 00:03:02.384
is it sort of just yelled at you

67
00:03:02.384 --> 00:03:05.430
before we tried to run it,

68
00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.980
now, we don't wanna do that every single time,

69
00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.340
what we wanna do is we only wanna do it,

70
00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.070
when somebody passes an argument

71
00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:16.020
to Keystone when they run it,

72
00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:17.240
so what we'll do here is we'll say,

73
00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:22.240
if process.argv.includes--seed-data

74
00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:32.920
then we will run await insert seed data,

75
00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:34.170
and the way that we run that,

76
00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:36.860
if we take a look at our package json,

77
00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:41.320
if we basically just run npm run seed data

78
00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:45.083
it just runs the same Keystone function here,

79
00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:47.650
but with --seed data,

80
00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:50.400
sorry, if you hear my kids screaming in the background,

81
00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:54.483
hey, guys I'm recording,

82
00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.180
all right, they settled down,

83
00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:01.900
okay, so the way that we run that is just kill your build

84
00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:05.610
and then run npm run, actually before we even do this,

85
00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:08.230
let's take a look at our MongoDB Compass

86
00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:12.200
and I'm gonna go into my database

87
00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:15.710
which is I'm gonna click this little refresh button

88
00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:19.270
and you see that sickfits showed up in the side bar here,

89
00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:21.650
and we see productimages, products and users,

90
00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:23.200
those are our three data types,

91
00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:24.560
you clicked through to products

92
00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:26.980
and you see this as our one test product in there,

93
00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:31.980
so now when we run npm run seed data, there we go,

94
00:04:32.392 --> 00:04:34.500
boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, done,

95
00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:39.140
inserted 12 products, if we refresh on our database

96
00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:42.450
you'll see that the products are all here,

97
00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:45.020
and now if we refresh our Keystone Admin,

98
00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:47.070
oh, obviously won't work 'cause we have to run it,

99
00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:51.526
so npm run dev and we have all of the images showing up,

100
00:04:51.526 --> 00:04:53.760
there was one little issue in that,

101
00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:55.225
they actually aren't showing up,

102
00:04:55.225 --> 00:04:56.420
(laughing),

103
00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:59.440
but it's gonna be fine, I'll explain why it's not working

104
00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:01.080
and this won't be an issue for yours

105
00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:02.700
is that if you click through to one of these,

106
00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:04.610
you'll see that the image is broken

107
00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:08.590
and if you inspect image on that and grab the URL

108
00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:10.590
you'll see it is broken

109
00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:13.177
and that's because I'm doing this tutorial

110
00:05:13.177 --> 00:05:15.010
with Wes Bos tutorial,

111
00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:17.220
what I uploaded it with was Wes Bos,

112
00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:19.900
so likely your name is also gonna be different

113
00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:21.940
and it's gonna be broken for you,

114
00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:23.200
so is that a big deal?

115
00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:27.480
No, and I'll show you why, because it doesn't change it,

116
00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:29.810
how it outputs it in the API Explorer,

117
00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:34.150
so if we click on here and you go to API Explorer here,

118
00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:35.930
and if you want, let's write a query here,

119
00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:40.930
so a query all product images and for each product image

120
00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:44.940
we want the id, let's just run it,

121
00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:46.700
boom, so we've got a list of all the images

122
00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:49.380
that we've uploaded and then inside of that,

123
00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:52.410
we want the, what is it?

124
00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:54.850
The image and inside of the image

125
00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:58.750
you can get all kinds of information, the encoding,

126
00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:01.870
if you're wondering what the possible options are,

127
00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:04.450
you can just hit Control+Space

128
00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:06.080
and it'll show you all of them,

129
00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:11.080
you can also go into the docs look for all product images

130
00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:15.560
or just product image

131
00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:19.940
and it will show you all of the fields that are available,

132
00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:21.340
in our case we want the public URL

133
00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:25.720
or the public URL transformed, so let's try that,

134
00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:30.720
let's just say, public URL and public URL transformed,

135
00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:34.480
run it and look, we got them all here,

136
00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:38.640
and you'll see that they are matching up with Wes Bos

137
00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:41.420
and Wes Bos tutorial

138
00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:43.950
and that's just because the seed data that I've given you

139
00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:45.800
is from two different accounts

140
00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:47.330
and likely it's gonna be a different account

141
00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:49.930
'cause you have your own account, so they still work,

142
00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:51.950
so if you visit one of these,

143
00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:55.360
this is one we uploaded from Keystone, it works

144
00:06:55.360 --> 00:07:00.360
and then if you also wanna pull one from,

145
00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:03.360
from my personal account, that one also works,

146
00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:05.600
so no sweat there.

147
00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:07.910
So that is seed data, that's how get it,

148
00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:12.450
you can certainly also if you're curious yourself

149
00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:15.566
you could upload 15 or 20 product images that you like

150
00:07:15.566 --> 00:07:19.220
and then you could go into MongoDB Compass

151
00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:24.220
and export them, and you can export it right here,

152
00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:28.200
select which fields you want and you could do a little dump

153
00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:30.990
and then put that data in your own thing,

154
00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:32.870
so you can just automate importing that,

155
00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:34.550
but that's a pretty handy thing to have,

156
00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:38.887
that is seed data in Keystone, let's get into the next one.
