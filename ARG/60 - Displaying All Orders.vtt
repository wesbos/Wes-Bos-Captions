1
00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:03.390
<v Instructor>Alright, now we're gonna do this orders page.</v>

2
00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:05.330
We already have an orders page.

3
00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:06.560
So we go ahead and open that.

4
00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:08.470
It should just say something like hello.

5
00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:10.200
What I'm gonna get you to do is,

6
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.810
take the code that we just wrote

7
00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:13.790
for the single order page,

8
00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:16.440
and just like blast it and overwrite that.

9
00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.220
'Cause that's gonna be very similar to what we're doing.

10
00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:20.658
What we do have to do is

11
00:00:20.658 --> 00:00:25.090
clean up these double ups

12
00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:29.863
because they are only needing to go one level up.

13
00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:33.720
Okay, then we'll go in here

14
00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.750
and say replace this single orders query

15
00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.760
with user orders query.

16
00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.747
And the thing that we run is called allOrders.

17
00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:48.170
With an S.

18
00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:49.726
And interestingly enough

19
00:00:49.726 --> 00:00:51.240
we don't need to pass

20
00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:53.270
like where the user's ID is equal

21
00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:55.182
to the currently signed in user.

22
00:00:55.182 --> 00:00:57.930
That's all gonna be figured out for us

23
00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.210
when we get into permissions.

24
00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.230
We are gonna be able to filter that.

25
00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.360
So when somebody just like queries all orders

26
00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:05.380
we can filter it down for the only the orders

27
00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:07.590
that they should be able to see themselves

28
00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.230
which is kind of cool.

29
00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:12.200
Then the things that we are querying

30
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.510
I think are all the same,

31
00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:15.540
ID for each order,

32
00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.010
the charge, the user, the items.

33
00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:20.840
I believe that's all the same stuff

34
00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.760
that we're gonna be querying but for each one,

35
00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:25.550
then we'll go down here

36
00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:30.550
and change this single order page to orders page.

37
00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:33.180
There is no query that gets passed in

38
00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.823
to this one right here.

39
00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:37.830
Then we go ahead

40
00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:40.570
and I guess we take away this variables here,

41
00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:42.070
we don't need to pass that in.

42
00:01:42.913 --> 00:01:44.690
The users orders query.

43
00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:46.460
If there is loading show loading,

44
00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.290
if there's error that.

45
00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:50.613
And then we want allOrders

46
00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.888
is gonna be destructured from data, okay.

47
00:01:56.888 --> 00:02:00.083
Then you can go ahead and delete everything inside of here.

48
00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:05.970
So let's just put a div that says allOrders.length.

49
00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.953
Shoot!

50
00:02:12.953 --> 00:02:15.835
Variable ID is never used in user orders query.

51
00:02:15.835 --> 00:02:18.363
Yeah you're right, we don't need that there.

52
00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:20.900
And actually if this is the case

53
00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.070
you don't even need the name of the query either,

54
00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:24.630
you can delete that.

55
00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.760
I'll leave it in I think it might get better debugging

56
00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.903
if it's in but it's not necessary.

57
00:02:28.903 --> 00:02:30.411
So loading seven.

58
00:02:30.411 --> 00:02:31.244
(chuckles)

59
00:02:31.244 --> 00:02:32.290
Alright, here we go.

60
00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.150
There's seven orders

61
00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.990
and now you probably know the drill by now

62
00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:41.360
is let's just get a writing some markup.

63
00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:46.360
So h2 says you have allOrders.length orders.

64
00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.610
Seven orders okay, good.

65
00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:57.380
Then let's make a little list here,

66
00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:59.433
so we'll say const OrderUL is equal to style.UL.

67
00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:12.090
And that is display grid, grid, template, columns

68
00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:16.093
Repeat.

69
00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:22.143
Auto fit.

70
00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:24.073
Min-max

71
00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:26.483
At a minimum,

72
00:03:26.483 --> 00:03:28.180
you want it, I don't know,

73
00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:31.120
350 PX and a maximum one fr

74
00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.933
and grid gap is for REM.

75
00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:39.200
I'll go here and get the order UL.

76
00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:40.990
And then we'll loop over all the orders.

77
00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:42.650
So allOrders.map.

78
00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:48.730
Order.

79
00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:49.870
Order.

80
00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:51.780
And then for each one,

81
00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:56.780
we want to return order item styles.

82
00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:03.340
And just put something in there, P A.

83
00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:06.093
This order item styles, I believe I've given to you.

84
00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:08.110
Let's try to import it.

85
00:04:17.464 --> 00:04:18.297
There we go.

86
00:04:18.297 --> 00:04:19.253
Order items, styles.

87
00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:22.963
Here we go.

88
00:04:22.963 --> 00:04:25.106
There's just a bunch of boxes showing up.

89
00:04:25.106 --> 00:04:27.540
Then inside of each of those,

90
00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:28.520
the whole thing,

91
00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:29.353
I'm just going to

92
00:04:29.353 --> 00:04:31.360
wrap the whole thing in a link to that specific order.

93
00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:36.360
So link href equals back ticks forward slash order

94
00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:42.683
forward slash order.ID.

95
00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:45.910
And inside of that,

96
00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:48.623
we want a div with a class of order meta.

97
00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:53.580
And let's just give ourselves a paragraph

98
00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:55.543
with the order.total in there.

99
00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:58.890
Link is not defined.

100
00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:00.040
Oh, we gotta import it.

101
00:05:03.697 --> 00:05:05.010
Oh, it didn't auto import.

102
00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:06.280
Let's do it ourselves.

103
00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:10.130
Import link from next link.

104
00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:14.223
And while we're here, we can get rid of order styles.

105
00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:18.453
And I believe that's it.

106
00:05:19.784 --> 00:05:20.617
There we go.

107
00:05:20.617 --> 00:05:23.273
Okay, let's wrap that in a format money.

108
00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:30.740
Okay, let's also pop a head tag in here.

109
00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:36.630
With the title that says your orders,

110
00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:40.170
and then you can just put

111
00:05:41.052 --> 00:05:43.263
how many orders they have in parentheses.

112
00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:48.493
There we go.

113
00:05:48.493 --> 00:05:49.326
You're orders.

114
00:05:49.326 --> 00:05:50.230
We have seven.

115
00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:52.370
Okay, what else do we need in this meta?

116
00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:54.060
Above the price,

117
00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:57.720
we should put how many items they have.

118
00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:58.870
So paragraph,

119
00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:00.460
we need to count how many

120
00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:06.640
items they have in total.

121
00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:08.943
And do we do that on this one?

122
00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:27.780
We did not count how many orders there were in total.

123
00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:30.790
So we can, we can just do it right in line.

124
00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:33.610
Or you could write a little separate function.

125
00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:35.210
Let me show you how to write a separate function.

126
00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:37.700
So what we'll do here is we'll make a function

127
00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:42.700
called count order count items in an order.

128
00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:49.270
It takes in an order,

129
00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:53.130
we return ordered items that reduce,

130
00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:56.400
and we get the tally and the item.

131
00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:57.240
And from that,

132
00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:02.193
we'll return the tally plus the item.quantity.

133
00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:05.510
And we'll start off with zero.

134
00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:08.040
See how that's just a little one-liner.

135
00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:09.730
But we write that so often.

136
00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:11.270
I hate writing reduces anyway.

137
00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:13.390
So it's nice to just put it in its own function.

138
00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:15.310
Then we should be able to go down here

139
00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:17.760
and write count items in an order,

140
00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:20.040
and then just pass it the order.

141
00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:22.950
And it tells us how many items are in that order.

142
00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:24.543
So we'll just say items.

143
00:07:25.816 --> 00:07:26.649
(whistles)

144
00:07:26.649 --> 00:07:27.553
Lookin good.

145
00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:33.580
We can see how many products there are

146
00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:38.580
so ordered items.length products.

147
00:07:41.762 --> 00:07:44.030
So like for example, this one is three items

148
00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:45.040
but one product...

149
00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:45.873
Oh, look at that.

150
00:07:45.873 --> 00:07:47.916
We got our links work.

151
00:07:47.916 --> 00:07:49.070
(chuckles)

152
00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:50.354
That's good.

153
00:07:50.354 --> 00:07:51.187
Let me click through them.

154
00:07:51.187 --> 00:07:53.003
They all of our links work, which is good.

155
00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:56.220
One thing is one product

156
00:07:56.220 --> 00:07:58.400
who we want to conditionally put that S in there.

157
00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:02.560
So we'll say if ordered items.length

158
00:08:03.690 --> 00:08:06.490
is equal to one than nothing.

159
00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:13.233
Otherwise we'll put a S.

160
00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:16.700
They're all one product.

161
00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:18.500
And the rest have S's on them, good.

162
00:08:21.119 --> 00:08:22.640
Below this div here,

163
00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:25.550
we want a div with a class of images

164
00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:29.020
and we'll loop over each of those.

165
00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:32.513
So ordered items.map,

166
00:08:34.011 --> 00:08:36.070
for each item

167
00:08:36.070 --> 00:08:38.250
we want to return an image tag.

168
00:08:38.250 --> 00:08:40.520
Let's put the key on it right away.

169
00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:44.110
This is why I always query the IDs of everything.

170
00:08:44.110 --> 00:08:46.550
We'll use the item.ID.

171
00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:49.710
By the way, sometimes if you're using the ID for something,

172
00:08:49.710 --> 00:08:50.860
and then you're using that ID

173
00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:52.730
somewhere else on the page as well

174
00:08:52.730 --> 00:08:53.990
React is going to yell at you

175
00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:57.450
because it says hey you've used that key twice on this page.

176
00:08:57.450 --> 00:08:59.026
If you ever run into that

177
00:08:59.026 --> 00:09:00.520
just a quick way around that

178
00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:03.280
is you can just tack something unique on the front,

179
00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:07.360
like image-item.id

180
00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:10.280
and that will sort of get around it.

181
00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:11.113
So if you ever do...

182
00:09:11.113 --> 00:09:12.680
I don't think we ran into that in this course,

183
00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:16.130
but it's it's handy to know that that type of stuff.

184
00:09:16.130 --> 00:09:18.130
The source of the image will be...

185
00:09:18.130 --> 00:09:22.160
Gosh, we have to write public URL transformed again.

186
00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:24.760
So item.image.

187
00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:26.693
Oh, we got need curly brackets here.

188
00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:29.623
Item.image.

189
00:09:31.210 --> 00:09:32.343
Oh, no, stock photo.

190
00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:37.843
Image.public url transformed.

191
00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:45.060
That's something we should have read

192
00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:47.986
to help our function for way earlier.

193
00:09:47.986 --> 00:09:48.819
In our case,

194
00:09:48.819 --> 00:09:50.490
let's put a quick little question mark on these,

195
00:09:50.490 --> 00:09:52.870
just in case there is no image associated with that product.

196
00:09:52.870 --> 00:09:54.350
It's not going to break it.

197
00:09:54.350 --> 00:09:57.030
But yeah, if we had a little helper function

198
00:09:57.030 --> 00:09:59.590
that says get image, URL,

199
00:09:59.590 --> 00:10:01.070
and then you pass it in item

200
00:10:01.070 --> 00:10:02.850
and it checks for all of these things

201
00:10:02.850 --> 00:10:04.360
and kicks it out to you.

202
00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:07.700
That would have been a good idea at the start of the course.

203
00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:10.493
The alts is the item.name, okay.

204
00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:15.153
It's given me grief here.

205
00:10:17.270 --> 00:10:22.270
React is only expected to return a single react child

206
00:10:28.170 --> 00:10:29.613
What's the problem here?

207
00:10:32.130 --> 00:10:34.023
Let's just delete that.

208
00:10:35.930 --> 00:10:38.963
Okay, it has actually nothing to do with our images.

209
00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:45.433
It is something to do with our images.

210
00:10:46.743 --> 00:10:50.140
I take that out and just put a paragraph that says

211
00:10:50.140 --> 00:10:52.043
hey, what is wrong?

212
00:10:58.970 --> 00:11:01.063
Oh, I know, I know,I know, I know.

213
00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:05.580
It's because we're stuffing everything in a link.

214
00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:09.363
So you can wrap those in a fragment.

215
00:11:11.740 --> 00:11:12.730
There that works.

216
00:11:12.730 --> 00:11:15.640
And then I put back that, there we go.

217
00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:18.240
Hey, this is actually kind of cool.

218
00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:23.240
I have used a little bit of CSS grid trickery here

219
00:11:26.370 --> 00:11:31.370
and we give it as many columns as we possibly want.

220
00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:32.693
At a minimum,

221
00:11:32.693 --> 00:11:34.240
seeing zero pixels wide

222
00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:38.000
and a maximum a hundred percent wide or one fr.

223
00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.230
And then what's cool about that

224
00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:44.210
is no matter how many images we have,

225
00:11:44.210 --> 00:11:47.700
it will just slice them and show them.

226
00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:49.440
And then each of the images

227
00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:52.240
I gave them a height of 200 PX

228
00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:54.630
and then an object fit of cover.

229
00:11:54.630 --> 00:11:56.620
And then they just cropped them as they needed.

230
00:11:56.620 --> 00:11:58.590
I thought that was pretty cool.

231
00:11:58.590 --> 00:12:02.040
I see if we took that off, then you get stretched images

232
00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:04.560
but by putting object fit cover

233
00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:06.040
they just kind of cropped them.

234
00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:09.890
There's also contained, which would show the entire image

235
00:12:09.890 --> 00:12:11.160
but that doesn't look as cool.

236
00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:12.453
So we'd go back to cover.

237
00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:15.716
So I thought that was worth showing you

238
00:12:15.716 --> 00:12:17.240
I believe that's it.

239
00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:19.010
Now again, let's just triple check.

240
00:12:19.010 --> 00:12:20.483
If we click on any of these.

241
00:12:21.810 --> 00:12:23.810
Oh, they no longer work.

242
00:12:23.810 --> 00:12:27.400
Okay, so know what we should do is...

243
00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:30.650
I think we can do an anchor link in here

244
00:12:30.650 --> 00:12:32.573
as the first child of the link.

245
00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:37.860
There we go.

246
00:12:37.860 --> 00:12:40.090
Now we can hover over these items

247
00:12:40.090 --> 00:12:41.650
and click through to the entire one.

248
00:12:41.650 --> 00:12:43.960
So that is our orders page

249
00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:47.423
being able to click through to each of our order items.
