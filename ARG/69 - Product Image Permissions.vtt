00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:02.340
<v Instructor>Last one we have here is</v>

2
00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:04.140
product image.ts

3
00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:05.820
and this one doesn't require any rules.

4
00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:06.700
It's pretty simple.

5
00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:08.750
We'll go into our fields here

6
00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:10.180
and above the fields,

7
00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:12.560
we give ourselves our access.

8
00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:15.430
So create, who should be able to create?

9
00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:17.090
Well you have to be, is signed in

10
00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:21.320
and anyone who has signed in can create a product,

11
00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.180
so they can also create a product image.

12
00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.430
The read,

13
00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:26.870
anyone can read the image.

14
00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:28.510
So that will be true.

15
00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:30.410
The update

16
00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:32.880
is only we're gonna restrict updating

17
00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.130
of product images strictly

18
00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.760
to people that have the permission.

19
00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.460
So say permissions

20
00:00:40.337 --> 00:00:41.170
.can

21
00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:43.053
manage products.

22
00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:46.663
And if again if we look at our fields,

23
00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:52.930
we have something called

24
00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:55.340
can manage products.

25
00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:57.280
There we go, it's that one.

26
00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.003
And then same for deleting them as well.

27
00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.830
That's it, that is access control for all of our lists.

28
00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:08.470
It's a little bit to get to go through them all

29
00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:10.750
and make sure you've got them all squared away.

30
00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:13.130
But once you start to get the hang

31
00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.530
of this idea of permission check marks

32
00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.790
and then rules that are based on filters or having access

33
00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:21.970
then you sort of get into the groove of it

34
00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:23.330
and you can do a great job with that.

35
00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:25.400
I really like how Keystone implements this.

36
00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:26.600
See you in the next one.
