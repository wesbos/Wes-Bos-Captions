00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:02.493
<v Instructor>All right now, we're gonna flip</v>

2
00:00:02.493 --> 00:00:03.890
to the back end for a little bit,

3
00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:05.830
and start working on the custom mutation

4
00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:06.960
to create the order.

5
00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.970
So when you think about what data types we need

6
00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:11.900
in order to actually create an order.

7
00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:14.460
Well, we obviously need an order.

8
00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.020
And if we think about what will be in the order,

9
00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:21.010
there'll be things like price and like charge,

10
00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:23.920
like they'll get a charge ID from Stripe

11
00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:25.880
and we'll put that in the order,

12
00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.440
but we also need to store reference

13
00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:31.320
to the products that the person bought.

14
00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.153
And you might think well okay,

15
00:00:32.153 --> 00:00:34.940
we'll just have like a reference to the products.

16
00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:36.633
The problem with that is that,

17
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.400
if somebody orders something,

18
00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:43.430
you need to store the photo, the price, the title,

19
00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:47.130
you need to store that information from when they bought it,

20
00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:52.130
because if the product updates or if the price changes,

21
00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:55.380
or any of that information changes in the product,

22
00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:57.810
it can't change in what the user had ordered.

23
00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:59.710
You need to tell them how much they paid

24
00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:01.880
and show them a picture of what they actually bought,

25
00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:03.460
and not the most recent version.

26
00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.020
So, we essentially need to create two new items.

27
00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.330
We need to create an order type, as well as order items,

28
00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.820
in which we'll basically just copy all the fields

29
00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.350
from the product into a order item that will allow us

30
00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:20.880
to go ahead and create that.

31
00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.880
So, we'll go into our schema here,

32
00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.800
and let's just take a look at our, maybe product.

33
00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:33.800 line:15% 
Let's save product.ts as capital O, order, capital I, item.

34
00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.240
And let's go through this here,

35
00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:42.240
say const, order item is equal to a list,

36
00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.563
and then inside of that we have fields,

37
00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:51.710
and we're going to have a name field,

38
00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.040
we'll have a description field, okay.

39
00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.460
We will have a photo field,

40
00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:00.878
now the photo field is going to be

41
00:02:00.878 --> 00:02:04.050
a reference to a product image.

42
00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:06.800
So we'll have a photo field, now the reference here

43
00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.750
is not gonna be product image.product,

44
00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:10.670
it's simply just going to be reference

45
00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:15.110
to a product image itself, it's not a two-way relationship.

46
00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.223
We'll leave all of this stuff to be the same here.

47
00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:24.400
Then the status is not something we need on that product,

48
00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.363
okay, so go ahead and remove that.

49
00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.843
The price is going to stay on there.

50
00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:35.480
And then we need a couple new things added to it as well,

51
00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.797
so we want quantity, so how many did they buy of that item?

52
00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:44.380
That's integer, and then we're also going to have

53
00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:48.120
a relationship to the order that this order item lives in.

54
00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.690
So say order is going to be a relationship,

55
00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:56.900
where the ref is order.items.

56
00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:01.040
And this is not yet created, so if we import it right away,

57
00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.040
it will probably break our build, but that's fine.

58
00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.163
We'll go into our keystone.ts,

59
00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:12.570
and let's just duplicate cart item to order item,

60
00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.913
and then go ahead and import that sucker.

61
00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:19.820
And there it is, it's being imported.

62
00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:22.770
So that's the first one, the next thing we need to do

63
00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:26.420
is actually go ahead and create our order itself,

64
00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:30.723 line:15% 
so go ahead and just save that file, capital O, order.ts.

65
00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:36.210
And the fields that we have for the order

66
00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:38.840
are going to be pretty simple.

67
00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.250
We need, let's just go, do, do, do,

68
00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:42.470
delete everything in here.

69
00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:44.333
The total is an integer.

70
00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:49.783
The items in the order is a relationship,

71
00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:55.830
and the reference is going to be order item.order,

72
00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:57.720
All of that's gonna be in quotes.

73
00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.180
So, we just created our order item

74
00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:04.820
and the reference is this, right?

75
00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:06.850
And then in here we say order item.order,

76
00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:09.170
that gives us a two-way relationship.

77
00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:11.380
We also wanna say many is true,

78
00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:15.720
because an order can have many order items,

79
00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.300
but is not true the other way around,

80
00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:20.340
an order order item will only ever have one order

81
00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:22.330
that it is related to.

82
00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:26.297
We have a user which is relationship, to our user.

83
00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:34.083
So reference to user.orders,

84
00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:38.013
and then the charge is just a text field.

85
00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:41.830
Okay, now last thing we need to do here is that

86
00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:44.580
you notice we just made this relationship right here.

87
00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:46.956
We also need to update our user,

88
00:04:46.956 --> 00:04:50.540
so that they can have a list of their possible orders.

89
00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:53.023
So we'll go back to our user.ts,

90
00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:56.930
and we'll go to the bottom here, look at this,

91
00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:58.890
add roles, cart and order.

92
00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:03.080
We've already added cart, we're adding orders now,

93
00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:05.710
and then roles will come in the next couple of videos.

94
00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:10.710
So say order, what are we, orders is a relationship,

95
00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:17.407
and the ref is going to be order.user, and many,

96
00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:21.620
Mandy, (laughs), can Mandy access this?

97
00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:25.963
Yes, Mandy may, but it's many, which is true.

98
00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:29.287
All right, then we'll go back to our keystone

99
00:05:29.287 --> 00:05:32.363
and import the order as well.

100
00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:37.353
And then you need to, oh, we forgot to rename it.

101
00:05:44.475 --> 00:05:48.240
Boom, nope, didn't boom it.

102
00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:50.420
Boom, that one didn't import either.

103
00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:55.183
All right, let's duplicate it, do, order.

104
00:05:58.280 --> 00:05:59.770
All right, so we just did a bunch of code,

105
00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:02.000
we just touched four different files.

106
00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.700
We need to make sure that that is all still working.

107
00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:06.200
So I'm going to kill my build,

108
00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:08.873
start it up again, for the backend.

109
00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:13.820
And one, if that worked properly,

110
00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:15.700
we should see it show up in the sides,

111
00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:18.110
unable to resolve two-way relationship field,

112
00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:21.770
order.items for order item.order.

113
00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:23.580
Okay, so there's something wrong

114
00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:25.470
with the schema that we just wrote.

115
00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:29.603
So unable to resolve the relationship order items, okay.

116
00:06:34.116 --> 00:06:36.450
So we're referencing, that means our order

117
00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:38.803
should have an items field on it.

118
00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:44.423
So we'll go to our order and oh, I forgot an S here, right?

119
00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:48.600
That's nice that Keystone will check all that stuff for us.

120
00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:50.990
There we go, we have our order items showing up

121
00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:53.600
at the sidebar, as well as our orders.

122
00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:57.290
You could manually create one of these here, like shoes,

123
00:06:57.290 --> 00:06:59.540
obviously these will just be generated for us,

124
00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:04.540
but shoes, photo, price, quantity,

125
00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:10.170
and we don't have an order to associate it with it yet.

126
00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:13.420
So we'll create it, okay, and then we'll go to orders

127
00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:18.050
and we'll create an order, for that much, the items,

128
00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:20.510
look, and now we can select from order items.

129
00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:22.650
I'm gonna select who bought that thing,

130
00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:26.160
and the charge is gonna be something like CH underscore,

131
00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:29.070
something like that, create the order, there we go.

132
00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:30.590
So that is where you can find,

133
00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:33.380
I think now if I edit this thing, there we go,

134
00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:35.210
you see that it now has a relationship

135
00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:37.733
to the actual order that it's in.

136
00:07:40.307 --> 00:07:42.710
One other thing here is you can see

137
00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:46.250
if we take a look at our list of orders,

138
00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:50.420
the ID is not actually a really good thing to look at.

139
00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:55.420
So what we can do, is we can put a label on this field,

140
00:07:55.570 --> 00:07:58.810
so we'll say the label field is going to be a virtual field.

141
00:07:58.810 --> 00:08:01.670
Now, a virtual field is something that is calculated

142
00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:03.960
on demand, it's not actually a value

143
00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:07.083
that's stored in the database, but it's something that is

144
00:08:07.083 --> 00:08:09.130
just generated as we need it.

145
00:08:09.130 --> 00:08:10.433
So we'll say virtual.

146
00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:16.260
And you see it just automatically imported

147
00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:18.800
the virtual field from next fields.

148
00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:21.690
And then in there, there's two things we need,

149
00:08:21.690 --> 00:08:25.140
first is a GraphQL return type, it's saying, all right,

150
00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:30.140
well if you're going to put this thing in your GraphQL API,

151
00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:32.470
and it's not actually in the database,

152
00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:35.780
then you have to specify to me what is it gonna return.

153
00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:37.223
In our case, it's a string.

154
00:08:38.130 --> 00:08:40.314
And then we also have a resolver,

155
00:08:40.314 --> 00:08:45.314
and that is a function that gives us the item,

156
00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:49.913
and inside of there, we can return,

157
00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:52.410
literally anything we want.

158
00:08:52.410 --> 00:08:57.410
Wes is cool, item.total.

159
00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:03.913
Watch this, actually well let's pop format, money,

160
00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:09.183
around that, just so that we can visually see.

161
00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:14.693
Boom, giving me grief here.

162
00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:21.870
Left side of comma operator is unused, what did we do?

163
00:09:23.970 --> 00:09:26.710
Oh, I put a comma here, that should be a semi-colon,

164
00:09:26.710 --> 00:09:27.863
hey, hey, there we go.

165
00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:35.293
Now, watch, we restart that thing.

166
00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:40.330
And this is really helpful if you ever want to create

167
00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:45.330
a custom label for your user,

168
00:09:46.030 --> 00:09:48.800
and you maybe wanna format something,

169
00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:50.110
or show it in different way,

170
00:09:50.110 --> 00:09:53.340
or maybe bunch up a couple of fields into one field.

171
00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:55.200
And there we go, Wes is cool, 2000,

172
00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:58.500
so that order now, is showing up there.

173
00:09:58.500 --> 00:09:59.840
Obviously we don't want the Wes is cool,

174
00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:00.760
but I'm just showing you,

175
00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:03.240
whatever you return from this resolver

176
00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:07.290
will be what is shown up as the label.

177
00:10:07.290 --> 00:10:10.600
And then of course, you can go a little bit further

178
00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:14.170
and show a couple other columns, probably users,

179
00:10:14.170 --> 00:10:17.300
charge, items, that's really helpful as well

180
00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:20.453
to see what was actually in that specific order.

181
00:10:22.050 --> 00:10:24.230
So that is a creating of the data types.

182
00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:27.323
In the next one we need to start writing a custom mutation.
