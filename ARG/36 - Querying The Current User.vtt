00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:02.390
<v Instructor>Over the next couple of videos,</v>

3
00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:04.820
we're gonna be working with signing in, signing up,

4
00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:06.770
signing out, resetting password,

5
00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:10.350
all of stuff that revolves around user authentication.

6
00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:13.510
And thankfully for us, Keystone does a really good job

7
00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:16.770
at sort of handling all the logic behind that

8
00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.210
and it's up to us to actually code the UI,

9
00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:21.080
where people can put their password in

10
00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:22.960
or reset it and things like that.

11
00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.120
So, what we're gonna do first

12
00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:28.240
is let's go to the navigation here.

13
00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.624
And we will start to show

14
00:00:30.624 --> 00:00:33.930
the currently logged in user in the navigation

15
00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.970
and if they are not logged in, we're gonna show

16
00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:39.790
a link in here to a sign up or sign in page.

17
00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:42.160
So, we need to go into our components here

18
00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.160
and we're gonna make a user component.

19
00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.200
So, User,

20
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:49.898
and that component is going to contain a query

21
00:00:49.898 --> 00:00:54.110
for the current user, as well as a custom hook

22
00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:56.730
that will allow us to get the current user,

23
00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.840
regardless of which file we're in.

24
00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.800
Because, we're gonna be writing a pretty big query

25
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.980
and any time you want the current user,

26
00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:07.770
it's kind of annoying to have to rerun that single query.

27
00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.240
So, what we can do here is we can just create a custom hook

28
00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.040
that will just return either the current user or not.

29
00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.010
And we don't have to worry about the logic

30
00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.960
that's behind that.

31
00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.490
So, we'll go in here into our user

32
00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:24.030
and we will make a function called useUser.

33
00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:28.130
And we'll export that.

34
00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:30.910
It's not a default here, so just export useUser.

35
00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:33.483
And then inside of that,

36
00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.720
we will write a query.

37
00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.843
So, const { data } is equal to useQuery.

38
00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:46.350
And we need to write a query called current_user_query.

39
00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.990
I'll write that in just a second.

40
00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.970
And I'll go up here and say, const.

41
00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:53.370
We'll take the name of that.

42
00:01:54.523 --> 00:01:57.120
Current_user_query = GQL.

43
00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:00.350
And let's stop a second just import a few things

44
00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:01.183
that we need.

45
00:02:01.183 --> 00:02:03.450
So we need to use query.

46
00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:04.283
Good.

47
00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.980
And then we also need GQL to be imported.

48
00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:10.230
Good, okay.

49
00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:12.110
Then inside of here,

50
00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.480
the query that we need to write

51
00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.070
is it's called authenticated item.

52
00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:20.210
And the reason why it's not user,

53
00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:24.740
because Keystone makes it sort of agnostic as to what

54
00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:26.170
this thing is called.

55
00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:27.510
When we set up our schema,

56
00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.520
we told it to use user as the authenticated item.

57
00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.660
But it could be authenticated company.

58
00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:38.090
It could be authenticated dog.(laughs)

59
00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:39.840
You know what I mean.

60
00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.220
It could be anything, obviously, it's most likely user,

61
00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.820
but we'll call it authenticated item.

62
00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:48.950
And then it's kind of interesting, this one right here,

63
00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:52.614
if we take a look at our graph QL API.

64
00:02:52.614 --> 00:02:55.364
(mouse clicking)

65
00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:58.603
And we were to query that.

66
00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:03.240
AuthenticatedItem.

67
00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:06.143
What is returned from that is like look,

68
00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.410
if you'd start typing, it's like, there's nothing here.

69
00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:11.800
Like name, run.

70
00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.480
Cannot query name, okay.

71
00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.853
Maybe ID, ID is always the one, right?

72
00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:17.523
No.

73
00:03:17.523 --> 00:03:18.670
So look like, what can you query?

74
00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:20.260
I'm logged in, right, I'm logged in.

75
00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:21.093
This is fine.

76
00:03:21.093 --> 00:03:22.630
Like, why can't I query anything on there?

77
00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:24.840
So we'll go to the docs for that.

78
00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.740
And we'll search for AuthenticatedItem

79
00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:32.333
and you see that it will return a user.

80
00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.760
But it doesn't return those values directly.

81
00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.730
It actually returns a type, which is a user.

82
00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:43.580
So close this and you say, okay, Wes.

83
00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:47.683
User.

84
00:03:47.683 --> 00:03:50.157
And then we get the ID, and that work?

85
00:03:50.157 --> 00:03:50.990
(mouse clicking)

86
00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.823
No.

87
00:03:51.823 --> 00:03:54.403
What about this user?

88
00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:59.260
And the interesting thing about that or the important thing

89
00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.470
to note that is that it returns a union.

90
00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:06.650
And a union means it could return multiple types of values.

91
00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:09.260
It could return this or this,

92
00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.950
and in our case it could return a user.

93
00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:17.130
And what we need to do is a special thing in graph QL

94
00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:21.440
that says ... on User.

95
00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:25.520
So, when the authenticated item returns a user,

96
00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:30.070
then on that user we will return the email and the ID

97
00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:31.120
and things like that.

98
00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:32.512
And then it will actually run.

99
00:04:32.512 --> 00:04:34.280
So, why is that?

100
00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:39.280
Well, sometimes you might be like query a media, right?

101
00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:43.330
And on that media,

102
00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:45.570
or you wanna say like

103
00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:50.570
on a TV show I wanna grab the episode count.

104
00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:54.450
But then if it is on a movie,

105
00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:58.180
then I just wanna grab the length

106
00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:01.880
or the length of how long it is or like time.

107
00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:04.580
And that's really important because sometimes we

108
00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:08.270
are querying for things that return two different types.

109
00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:09.840
They both are media.

110
00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:12.050
So, they're still of the type of media,

111
00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:14.530
but they're sort of a subtype.

112
00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:17.000
And in order for us to stop writing

113
00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.330
a whole bunch of if statements and whatnot,

114
00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:22.390
we simply just say when it is a TV show or on a TV show,

115
00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:23.740
give me the episode count.

116
00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:25.560
And when it's a movie or on a movie,

117
00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:26.393
give me this time.

118
00:05:26.393 --> 00:05:29.170
So, in our case, it only does return one thing,

119
00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:30.117
which is user.

120
00:05:30.117 --> 00:05:32.540
But I would imagine that authenticatedItem

121
00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:36.460
could return other things as well for that specific,

122
00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:37.920
because it's not just a user.

123
00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:40.570
Like I said, it could be a company as well.

124
00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:44.090
So, in our case, we say on user, give me the ID and email.

125
00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:48.270
So, we'll go back here and say ... on user.

126
00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:53.270
And for that user, we wanna get the ID, the email, the name,

127
00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:56.463
and then we'll put a little to-do here.

128
00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:00.600
Query the cart once we have it.

129
00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:02.870
We don't have a cart yet but we're going to be querying

130
00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:05.710
the user's cart on this user right here.

131
00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:08.100
So, now that we have that, we can go here

132
00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:13.100
and say const { data } = useQuery(CURRENT_USER_QUERY).

133
00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:17.053
And then we will return data?authenticatedItem.

134
00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:22.110
And what that'll do is to say,

135
00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:25.780
if there is data return the authenticatedItem inside of it.

136
00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:28.070
If there's not data the question mark

137
00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:29.700
will just return undefined.

138
00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:30.770
And that way we'll know

139
00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:32.760
that the user's not currently logged in.

140
00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:36.610
So, this may seem really simple but this is way better

141
00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:39.730
than having to import the query

142
00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:43.140
and useQuery and access the autheticatedItem

143
00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:44.770
and check for the nested values.

144
00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:47.400
So, just tuck it away into its own little hook.

145
00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:49.980
Then what we can do is in our Nav,

146
00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:51.290
we simply use that hook.

147
00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:53.903
So, we'll say, do we export that?

148
00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:55.673
Yes we do.

149
00:06:55.673 --> 00:06:58.850
And we also need to export the CURRENT_USER_QUERY as well.

150
00:06:58.850 --> 00:06:59.793
That's important.

151
00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:01.880
So, in here, we'll just say,

152
00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:04.923
const user = useUser.

153
00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:09.620
And we can import that.

154
00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:14.620
And if you log out the user and you're logged in,

155
00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:19.690
we should see an object.

156
00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:20.523
There we go.

157
00:07:20.523 --> 00:07:23.440
There's the object of the currently logged in user.

158
00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:28.440
If I were to open this up in a incognito tab here.

159
00:07:28.470 --> 00:07:29.850
That should be.

160
00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:31.210
There we go, null.

161
00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:33.760
It returns to us, null, which is great.

162
00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:38.683
So, we can go into our navigation here and say,

163
00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:43.350
like what are the things that we only wanna show

164
00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:44.263
if they're logged in.

165
00:07:44.263 --> 00:07:45.760
These three things right here.

166
00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:47.760
So, what we'll do is we'll say,

167
00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:48.837
user &amp;&amp; ().

168
00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:54.080
And then inside of those parentheses,

169
00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:55.970
we'll put the items that we only want to show up

170
00:07:55.970 --> 00:07:57.120
when they're logged in.

171
00:07:58.078 --> 00:07:59.440
(keyboard clicking)
Okay.

172
00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:01.910
Given me some grief here.

173
00:08:01.910 --> 00:08:03.920
Adjacent JSX elements, obviously,

174
00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:06.080
you can't return three elements right here.

175
00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:10.803
So, you have to use a fragment in React.

176
00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:15.160
So, that looks fine.

177
00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:19.830
And if I open up the...

178
00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:23.090
That in a not logged in state,

179
00:08:23.090 --> 00:08:24.770
we'll only see products showing up.

180
00:08:24.770 --> 00:08:25.603
Okay, good.

181
00:08:25.603 --> 00:08:29.703
Now, what we want is if the user is not logged in.

182
00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:37.710
So, if there is no user then what we wanna do is

183
00:08:37.710 --> 00:08:40.104
we'll have a sign in link.

184
00:08:40.104 --> 00:08:42.603
It'll link them to the sign-in page.

185
00:08:43.870 --> 00:08:46.620
(mouse clicking)

186
00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:52.060
And I'm gonna do this work in a incognito tab,

187
00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:54.880
just so they don't actually have to log out just yet.

188
00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:57.760
And then you click on, that's not a page yet.

189
00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:00.670
So, we'll go ahead and create that page.

190
00:09:00.670 --> 00:09:02.010
So, go to your pages.

191
00:09:02.010 --> 00:09:04.870
Let's just take one that doesn't have anything in it.

192
00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:06.163
What could it be here?

193
00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:07.883
Orders.

194
00:09:07.883 --> 00:09:12.883 line:15% 
Let's just save orders.js as signin.js.

195
00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:15.690 line:15% 
Rename this to SignInPage.

196
00:09:18.209 --> 00:09:19.780
And we'll say sign on in.

197
00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:27.230
All right, so that is the querying the current user.

198
00:09:27.230 --> 00:09:31.370
In the next one, we will code the sign-in form,

199
00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:34.323
then the sign-up form and then there's a couple more.
