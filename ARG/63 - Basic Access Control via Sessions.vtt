1
00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:04.630
<v Instructor>Now that we've assigned roles to users</v>

2
00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:07.560
you can then go ahead and query that data

3
00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.790
on the currently authenticated user

4
00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:11.950
by saying something like this; authenticated item,

5
00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:14.620
and then when it is a user, give me the role

6
00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:16.980
and on each of those, we will have all

7
00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.300
of our can manage, can manage roles, can manage orders

8
00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.440
can see other users, can manage products.

9
00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.210
These are all the check boxes that we created

10
00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:28.400
in our fields.ts value.

11
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.340
Now, part of our sort of permissions array

12
00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:35.260
is we're going to want to have access

13
00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.470
to all of these permissions on the session.

14
00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:41.130
Remember, the session is a little bit of information

15
00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:43.100
about the currently logged-in user

16
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:47.120
that we get access to when we are doing

17
00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:48.620
any sort of server site check.

18
00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:52.370
So Keystone has access to the session when it checks

19
00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:54.990
if you're able to update an item or delete an item

20
00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:59.340
or to create an item or to update a specific field;

21
00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.300
Keystone will check the session for all of those things.

22
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.330
So what we need to do is go back

23
00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.830
to our Keystone.ts and you already see

24
00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:12.250
that we've queried on every single session,

25
00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:15.820
we've queried the ID, the name and the email

26
00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:17.470
of the currently logged in user.

27
00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:20.140
And what that does is every single time there's a request,

28
00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.900
Keystone goes and grabs that data from the database

29
00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.410
and then it uses it in simple things

30
00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:27.690
like our add-to-cart mutation,

31
00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:32.360
we get access to the session and then we check here.

32
00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.340
We check if the user is logged in

33
00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.890
and you can use any information on the session you want.

34
00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:38.670
And that's just a little shortcut

35
00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.010
so that we don't have to explicitly query

36
00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:44.150
the current user every single time that we want to.

37
00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:47.080
So what we want to do is, including the ID,

38
00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.420
the name and the email on every session,

39
00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.110
we also want to query the user's roles

40
00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:56.010
because we're going to need these pieces of information

41
00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:58.960
when we go to give a yes or a no

42
00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.620
to whether somebody should access something.

43
00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:04.430
So what we do here is you could simply just

44
00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.030
write the GraphQL query, which is the role,

45
00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.730
and then curly brackets, and this is on one line.

46
00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:11.900
You could put it on multiple lines if you want

47
00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.670
and then you would just normally

48
00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.380
just type all the fields that you want;

49
00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:20.010
so something like that, can manage cart, can manage users.

50
00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.130
You'd be able to type all of that in there.

51
00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:23.360
Now that's a little bit annoying

52
00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:24.900
and this is actually something that comes

53
00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.850
up a lot for me in GraphQL,

54
00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:30.710
is that often you find yourself typing the same thing

55
00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:32.020
over and over and over again

56
00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:35.130
because GraphQL doesn't have a way just to say

57
00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:36.940
give me everything, everything you got.

58
00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.180
You have to be explicit with each of the fields

59
00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:43.270
and pieces of information that you want from GraphQL.

60
00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:46.030
So, because we've already written

61
00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:50.300
all of these can values here, so what I did

62
00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:54.280
in this file here is we took those permission fields,

63
00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.410
we took the keys from them,

64
00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:58.660
so if you have an object

65
00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:00.893
the keys are just gonna be these values.

66
00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:04.570
And what that will do is it will give us

67
00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:05.880
an array of all of them

68
00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.010
and then we just exported them

69
00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.780
as a variable called permissions list.

70
00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.302
It's an array of type of permissions.

71
00:03:13.302 --> 00:03:17.390
Then what we can do is in here, we can import that array

72
00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:20.950
and then just interpolate it into this user right here.

73
00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:24.210
So what we'll do is we'll leave the curly brackets there,

74
00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:28.030
turn this into backticks so that we can use interpolation,

75
00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:29.310
and then we'll use dollar sign

76
00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:33.710
curly bracket to take the permission list.

77
00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:38.710
And we'll call it .join on that with a space in between

78
00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:41.900
and what that will do is it doesn't matter

79
00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:43.380
if it's on a new line or not,

80
00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.440
but these queries will run if they're all in the same line,

81
00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:47.860
as long as there's a space in between

82
00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:49.620
each field that you want, see?

83
00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.870
It works exactly the same.

84
00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:55.990
Then make sure we imported that permission list.

85
00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:57.723
Let's look for where it is.

86
00:04:02.165 --> 00:04:02.998
There we go,

87
00:04:02.998 --> 00:04:05.630
import permission list from schema, forward slash fields.

88
00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:07.130
Okay.

89
00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:12.130
That looks like it's working really well for us.

90
00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.160
Now, what we want to do is to write

91
00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:18.773
our very first access control function

92
00:04:18.773 --> 00:04:22.060
and an access control function is at the very basics

93
00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:24.823
going to say yes or no, can we access something?

94
00:04:25.707 --> 00:04:26.540
So what I want you to do is go into

95
00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:29.000
your Keystone folder for the backend

96
00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.280
and create a new file just in the root of the folder.

97
00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:35.860
It's gonna be a sibling to Types and Keystone.ts.

98
00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:38.570
We'll go in here and we'll call it access.ts

99
00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:43.330
And then in here we're going to write

100
00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:44.890
all of our access functions.

101
00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:46.990
So we'll write a very simple one now

102
00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:49.540
and get into a couple more complex ones in coming videos.

103
00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:51.790
So we'll write a little comment here

104
00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:53.113
that says at its simplest,

105
00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:59.160
access control is either a yes or a no value

106
00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:01.950
depending on the user session.

107
00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:04.940
So a really good one for that is

108
00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:07.110
is the user signed in or not?

109
00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:10.120
So what we'll do here is we'll export a function

110
00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:12.383
called is signed in,

111
00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:17.710
and then part of that will give us access to the context

112
00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:20.450
or this function will always have access to the context,

113
00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:23.750
just like we did in our add-to-cart function.

114
00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:25.330
You see, we've got the context here.

115
00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:29.470
So inside of context, we have access to the user's session

116
00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:31.940
and what we can do is we can check

117
00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:35.200
if there is even a user session at all.

118
00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:37.500
So what we'll do here is we'll simply say

119
00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:40.120
return bang bang session.

120
00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:44.570
So what that will do is, is if session is undefined,

121
00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:46.500
putting a double bang in front of it;

122
00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:48.040
so let's say we have undefined here;

123
00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:51.230
putting a double bang in front of it will return false,

124
00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:53.460
meaning that they are not signed in

125
00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:56.810
but if the user session is signed in;

126
00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:00.860
so just like something like email is, Hey;

127
00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:04.150
then that will return true because it is.

128
00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:07.270
So the bang bang is not entirely necessary there,

129
00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:10.429
but what it does is it takes these falsey

130
00:06:10.429 --> 00:06:13.800
and truthy values and converts them,

131
00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:16.280
or coerces them is the proper name,

132
00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:20.170
into true booleons of true or false.

133
00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:24.940
So that's the very basics of a function here.

134
00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:26.080
One more thing we can do here

135
00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:30.340
is type this as list access args

136
00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:33.080
and that should import the list access args

137
00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:36.920
from our Types file, which is right here,

138
00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:39.430
list access args and there we go,

139
00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:41.320
has the item ID in the session.

140
00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:45.210
So now that we have that

141
00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:47.710
I'm gonna show you how we can hook that up

142
00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:51.330
to our access control on each of our lists.

143
00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:53.600
So let's open one of our schema lists

144
00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:57.245
which is product.ts, that's a very simple one,

145
00:06:57.245 --> 00:06:59.670
and then every single list

146
00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:02.170
for every single data type that we have

147
00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:04.330
you can add an access value

148
00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:08.910
to either the entire list or an individual field

149
00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:12.240
and each access will tell us if we can crud it;

150
00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:15.110
create, read, update, delete.

151
00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:17.993
So we'll go here and we'll say access.

152
00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:22.190
I got to put a comma there and get rid of this to do

153
00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:23.460
because we're doing it,

154
00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:25.730
and then it'll say access create.

155
00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:27.350
Is the user allowed to create it?

156
00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:29.280
You can just put false there if you want.

157
00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:33.880
Is the create read, update, and delete.

158
00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:37.620
So what this would do is it would stop anybody ever

159
00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:41.300
from create, read, update, delete any of the actual values.

160
00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:44.850
But what you can do is you can replace these

161
00:07:44.850 --> 00:07:47.570
with functions that will figure out

162
00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:49.070
if it should be true or false.

163
00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:51.810
So let's just replace all of them right now

164
00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:55.110
and we'll replace it with our is signed in function

165
00:07:56.020 --> 00:07:57.970
and what that should do is,

166
00:07:57.970 --> 00:08:00.640
we should auto import it as well, it comes in right here;

167
00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:03.310
import is signed in from access

168
00:08:03.310 --> 00:08:05.670
which is the function we just wrote right here

169
00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:10.030
and that function will return true or false for us.

170
00:08:10.030 --> 00:08:12.890
So now if we restart our backend here

171
00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:18.110
and let's just write a little query called,

172
00:08:18.110 --> 00:08:19.190
here, I've got one right here,

173
00:08:19.190 --> 00:08:22.980
query all products, grab the name and the ID on it.

174
00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:24.230
I'm just gonna refresh the page

175
00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:25.880
so I know when Keystone is ready.

176
00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:29.730
There we go, go ahead and run it.

177
00:08:29.730 --> 00:08:31.320
We get a list of all our products, right?

178
00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:34.400
Not a big deal, but if I were to open this

179
00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:37.800
in a private window where I'm not signed in

180
00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:40.063
and try and run the same query,

181
00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:43.910
we will get an authentication error.

182
00:08:43.910 --> 00:08:44.743
Why?

183
00:08:44.743 --> 00:08:46.140
You do not have access to this resource.

184
00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:48.620
So what we've done there is we've limited

185
00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:52.410
being able to query; in our case, we were reading;

186
00:08:52.410 --> 00:08:54.900
products to only people who are signed in

187
00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:56.750
and now that's not actually what we want to do

188
00:08:56.750 --> 00:08:59.530
because we do want people to be able to

189
00:08:59.530 --> 00:09:01.630
read them all the time.

190
00:09:01.630 --> 00:09:03.730
We only want them to create them if they're signed in,

191
00:09:03.730 --> 00:09:06.760
we only want them to update them when they own them,

192
00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:08.620
and we only want people to delete them

193
00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:11.370
when they own them or you are an admin.

194
00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:13.410
So that's a little bit more complicated

195
00:09:13.410 --> 00:09:15.510
and we'll get into that in the next video.
