00:00:00.136 --> 00:00:01.494
(whooshing)

2
00:00:01.494 --> 00:00:03.010
<v Instructor>All right, we are going to get</v>

3
00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:05.950
into Keystone in the back end of things

4
00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:08.730
and in order to do that, we first need a database

5
00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.180
because Keystone, when we create all of our items

6
00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:13.880
and our schemas and saving products to the database

7
00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:14.713
and uploading images,

8
00:00:14.713 --> 00:00:16.900
all that data gets saved into a database.

9
00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.980
Now, Keystone is a layer that sort of sits on top

10
00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:23.220
of a number of different databases.

11
00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.540
You can use MongoDB, you can use Postgres,

12
00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:27.200
or you can use Prisma.

13
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.439
Now, we're gonna be using MongoDB.

14
00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.910
MongDB is one of my favorite databases.

15
00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:33.240
You'll hear people say they love it or they hate

16
00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.930
or it's amazing or it's awful and slow

17
00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:38.890
and I've been using MongoDB for many years.

18
00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:40.360
I run my own course platform on it

19
00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:42.250
and I'm a big fan of it.

20
00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:45.330
So we are getting into that.

21
00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:48.677
Now, you, if you know how to install MongoDB,

22
00:00:48.677 --> 00:00:51.250
and you know ho to make a new database,

23
00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:53.060
you can skip this video.

24
00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:54.040
This video's for people

25
00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:58.240
who don't necessarily have made a database before.

26
00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:01.370
So we have two options for a database.

27
00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.420
We can either run MongoDB locally on our computer

28
00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:09.011
and the benefit of that is it's super fast.

29
00:01:09.011 --> 00:01:11.320
If you have like a slow network connection

30
00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.110
or you're doing this on an airplane

31
00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.201
or something like that,

32
00:01:14.201 --> 00:01:16.842
then you'll be able to do most of it

33
00:01:16.842 --> 00:01:19.500
without having an internet connection.

34
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.770
The downside to that is it can be a little bit difficult

35
00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.660
to get MongoDB installed on your specific computer.

36
00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:28.620
So if you take a look at the MongoDB documentation,

37
00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:33.180
they have some ways to get it installed on Windows.

38
00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.420
Holy, actually the Windows is not too, too bad.

39
00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:39.090
And installing it on macOS

40
00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:41.710
and it's usually what I'll do

41
00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:46.560
is I run MongoDB in a tab

42
00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.710
and that will start it

43
00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:50.500
and sort of run it in the background.

44
00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.440
The other way, and what I'm gonna recommend,

45
00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.340
so if you want to go down the route of installing it locally

46
00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.330
in your computer, you can follow these instructions

47
00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:59.180
to get it up and running.

48
00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:00.990
It's really not too, too bad.

49
00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.330
However, the better way is to use MongoDB Atlas.

50
00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:06.760
And this is a hosted service.

51
00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:09.171
It has a very generous free tier.

52
00:02:09.171 --> 00:02:11.790
And what I like about it

53
00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.720
is that it's from MongoDB themselves.

54
00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.100
They give you a whole layer of like really nice UI

55
00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:22.260
and reporting and analytics on top of your database.

56
00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.520
And when it comes time to deploy this sucker

57
00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.678
to the internet,

58
00:02:26.678 --> 00:02:31.140
you're gonna have to run it on a public database somewhere

59
00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.306
and I use MongoDB myself

60
00:02:34.306 --> 00:02:36.270
on MongoDB Atlas.

61
00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:38.070
So it's really good.

62
00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:39.020
So what I want you to do

63
00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.040
is go ahead and start a,

64
00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:44.390
sign up for an account on MongoDB Atlas.

65
00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:45.950
And I'm gonna go through all the steps

66
00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:47.630
on setting it up for you.

67
00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:49.610
If you've watched some of my other tutorials,

68
00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:51.051
which we use Mlab,

69
00:02:51.051 --> 00:02:54.310
the process is a little bit more involved,

70
00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:56.490
so that's why I'm gonna record this.

71
00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:59.210
So once you're signed into your thing,

72
00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:02.320
you're gonna wanna make a new organization

73
00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:05.040
for what you want.

74
00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.680
And I'm saying this because you don't wanna mix

75
00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:10.990
like production data

76
00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:13.300
or if you ever wanna share this with a friend,

77
00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:14.630
just make a new organization

78
00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:16.840
and get it nice and clean from the start.

79
00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:20.520
So if you just created a brand new account,

80
00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:23.550
you probably can use whatever organization that you have

81
00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:25.963
but I'm gonna create a brand new one here.

82
00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:32.243
And I'm gonna call it Sick Fits Org.

83
00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:35.103
We want MongoDB Atlas.

84
00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:38.202
And add a member.

85
00:03:38.202 --> 00:03:41.120
Permissions, okay, so this is me.

86
00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.660
I've got my, I'm the organization owner.

87
00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:46.210
You can also add additional people.

88
00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:47.990
In my case, I don't need that,

89
00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:49.840
so I'm gonna create the organization.

90
00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.140
Okay, so now we create an organization.

91
00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:54.230
That's not a database yet.

92
00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:57.500
That was just like a governing body over our database.

93
00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:59.330
Now, we wanna make a new project,

94
00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:03.460
which I found very confusing but the word project

95
00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:04.860
is a database.

96
00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:08.023
So create a new project, we're gonna call it Sick Fits.

97
00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:11.373
Click on Next.

98
00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:15.230
And do we wanna add more people to it?

99
00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:16.063
No.

100
00:04:16.063 --> 00:04:17.083
Create the project.

101
00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:20.290
Then once we're in there,

102
00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:22.020
we need to create a cluster.

103
00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:23.710
Click on build a cluster.

104
00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:26.483
We wanna go for the shared free cluster.

105
00:04:28.704 --> 00:04:32.030
It's extremely cheap when you get into running them

106
00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:33.870
but we just want the free one.

107
00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:35.400
So create that.

108
00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:36.233
This is kinda cool.

109
00:04:36.233 --> 00:04:38.590
It asks you where do you wanna put your data?

110
00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:42.410
So in our case, I'm gonna go AWS on us-east-1.

111
00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:44.720
That's the one that always goes down

112
00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:46.993
that most of the internet is hosted on.

113
00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:51.670
Cluster tier, we are on the Sandbox,

114
00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:53.290
which is free forever.

115
00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:55.371
And it doesn't given you any backup.

116
00:04:55.371 --> 00:04:58.830
MongoDB version that you want.

117
00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:01.363
It probably doesn't matter which version you want.

118
00:05:01.363 --> 00:05:03.100
If they set that as the default,

119
00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:04.470
then just go with that.

120
00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:06.250
And then finally, cluster name.

121
00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:08.173
Let's call it SickCluster.

122
00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:12.960
I'm sure you can think

123
00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:15.350
of some other fun names for a cluster.

124
00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:16.890
So go ahead and create it.

125
00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:18.360
Now, this will take, I don't know,

126
00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.660
a couple minutes or so.

127
00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:21.880
While that is going on,

128
00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:25.210
let's open up our Keystone backend

129
00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:27.810
and get to configging this database.

130
00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:30.033
So I'm gonna open up my terminal here.

131
00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:35.390
And I'm gonna go to our Sick Fits directory

132
00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:39.320
and I'm gonna go into the backend folder.

133
00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:41.460
We have already an npm install on this directory

134
00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:43.100
but you should have done that earlier.

135
00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:46.280
And then I'm going to just open up that

136
00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:48.090
in another VS Code window

137
00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:50.265
and you see that it is pink at the top

138
00:05:50.265 --> 00:05:55.080
so that it shows us that this is our backend.

139
00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:58.550
Now, in order to get going on the backend,

140
00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:02.560
we need to put all of the information

141
00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:05.950
about connecting to our database somewhere safe

142
00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:08.940
because if you just put the connection strings

143
00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:10.620
and the passwords and the usernames

144
00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:11.830
and all of that information,

145
00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:14.350
if you just put that in like a JavaScript file,

146
00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:16.277
then what ends up happening

147
00:06:16.277 --> 00:06:19.894
is that that data goes into your version control

148
00:06:19.894 --> 00:06:24.060
and it's not good to have that sort of secret data in there.

149
00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:27.460
So we need to put it in a .env file

150
00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:31.830
and the .env file does not go into your version control.

151
00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:34.830
It is just for local development

152
00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:36.660
and then when we deploy, we'll figure out

153
00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:40.060
how to replicate all of these.

154
00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:42.970
These are called environmental variables in there.

155
00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:46.460
So this is a sample file of all the environmental variables

156
00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:49.260
that we will be using in here.

157
00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:52.130
What I want you to do is to, and this is super important,

158
00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:54.097
we need to rename this, okay?

159
00:06:54.097 --> 00:06:56.780
A lot of people always get tripped up on this part

160
00:06:56.780 --> 00:06:57.613
in my courses.

161
00:06:57.613 --> 00:06:58.490
You've gotta rename it.

162
00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:00.083
Don't leave it as sample.env.

163
00:07:00.083 --> 00:07:05.083
You wanna rename it to just .env.

164
00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:07.360
Okay?

165
00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:08.400
Now let's go through it.

166
00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:09.790
Cloudinary, that's for image uploading.

167
00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:10.807
We'll get that. COOKIE_SECRET.

168
00:07:10.807 --> 00:07:13.760
Go ahead and change this to literally anything.

169
00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:16.670
Literally anything.

170
00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:18.740
This just has to be a random string

171
00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:20.670
because when we sign our cookies

172
00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:21.503
and when we generate them,

173
00:07:21.503 --> 00:07:24.540
they are based on this, what is in here.

174
00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:26.300
So don't do what I did.

175
00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:28.790
Do something, literally any other string

176
00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:31.935
of characters in the human race do that.

177
00:07:31.935 --> 00:07:33.600
DATABASE_URL.

178
00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:34.890
Okay, so this is where we're going

179
00:07:34.890 --> 00:07:37.950
to put the MongoDB URL once we get it.

180
00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:39.290
STRIPE, that's for check out.

181
00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:40.543
We don't need that.

182
00:07:40.543 --> 00:07:43.570
As email, we'll hit that

183
00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:46.230
and then finally, FRONTEND_URL, that's important.

184
00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:47.752
And what are we running?

185
00:07:47.752 --> 00:07:50.040
What are we running our front end URL?

186
00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:50.873
7777.

187
00:07:50.873 --> 00:07:53.080
So that's right, so if you're running on a different port

188
00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:57.143
or whatever, you would change that URL right there.

189
00:07:58.220 --> 00:08:01.500
Okay, looks like it's still being created.

190
00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:02.500
So while we're doing that,

191
00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:05.180
let's open up MongoDB Compass.

192
00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:07.600
That's an app I've had you installed,

193
00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:09.670
and this is a just a nice little tool

194
00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:11.131
that's gonna allow us to connect.

195
00:08:11.131 --> 00:08:14.370
Watch, I'm gonna connect to my local database right now.

196
00:08:14.370 --> 00:08:16.370
I've got all kinds of databases in here.

197
00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:18.210
Let's see, the one that we're working with

198
00:08:18.210 --> 00:08:22.170
is called Sick Fits Keystone

199
00:08:22.170 --> 00:08:24.500
and you'll see that the items are in here.

200
00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:25.333
If I open that up.

201
00:08:25.333 --> 00:08:27.690
Look at it, this is just all the data in our database.

202
00:08:27.690 --> 00:08:29.331
You can view it as a table as well.

203
00:08:29.331 --> 00:08:32.210
And if you ever, for whatever reason,

204
00:08:32.210 --> 00:08:33.680
if the backend ever breaks

205
00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:36.638
or you just wanna manually add or delete data,

206
00:08:36.638 --> 00:08:38.080
you can do that.

207
00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:39.960
This is just a raw database access.

208
00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:43.980
So this is a really nice little database GUI

209
00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:45.800
and big fan of that.

210
00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:49.020
Okay, so it has created our cluster.

211
00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:52.440
Now what we need to do is we need to connect to it.

212
00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:56.713
So we're gonna go ahead and click on Connect.

213
00:08:57.650 --> 00:09:00.650
And it's gonna ask us where do you want

214
00:09:00.650 --> 00:09:03.840
to be able to connect to this database for?

215
00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:08.840
Because by default, MongoDB will only allow connections

216
00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:11.400
from specific IPs that you allow it to.

217
00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:12.620
So normally what would happen

218
00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:16.200
is you would add like IP address from your work machine,

219
00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:17.640
you would add the IP addresses

220
00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:22.640
of the server that you're hosting your application on,

221
00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:24.250
et cetera, et cetera.

222
00:09:24.250 --> 00:09:26.450
And that just stops any malicious actors

223
00:09:26.450 --> 00:09:29.340
who are trying to connect from random IP addresses.

224
00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:32.460
When we're working for this right now,

225
00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:33.990
we just need to allow everybody in

226
00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:35.640
just so you don't get tripped up on it.

227
00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:37.820
Believe me, this is a common problem that we have.

228
00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:40.853
So we wanna click on allow access from anywhere.

229
00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:45.520
And say come on in.

230
00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:48.020
Add an IP address, good.

231
00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:50.750
Then we create a database user.

232
00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:54.280
So we will call that oh,

233
00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:55.610
let's call it sick

234
00:09:55.610 --> 00:09:59.640
and the password is gonna be something good.

235
00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:02.987
Let's just use, 1Password suggested one right here.

236
00:10:02.987 --> 00:10:07.987
I'm gonna call that MongoDB Sick Fits

237
00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:10.500
and I'll save that.

238
00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:14.850
Okay, so save that data just for a second.

239
00:10:14.850 --> 00:10:15.953
I'm gonna copy it.

240
00:10:17.988 --> 00:10:19.810
And I'm just gonna put that in a URL.

241
00:10:19.810 --> 00:10:21.680
Obviously, I'm gonna have to change this

242
00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:24.440
before I deploy this course so you don't see it.

243
00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:28.083
So put those somewhere where you won't lose them

244
00:10:28.083 --> 00:10:30.310
just for a quick second.

245
00:10:30.310 --> 00:10:33.559
And we click create database user, okay?

246
00:10:33.559 --> 00:10:37.170
And then we need to choose a connection method.

247
00:10:37.170 --> 00:10:39.690
So we need a connection string.

248
00:10:39.690 --> 00:10:40.523
So which one?

249
00:10:40.523 --> 00:10:42.986
Mongo Shell, connect your application

250
00:10:42.986 --> 00:10:45.260
or connect using MongoDB Compass.

251
00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:47.910
I think it's connect your application.

252
00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:49.140
Yes, there we go

253
00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:53.850
and then it's gonna give us this URL right here.

254
00:10:53.850 --> 00:10:56.160
So what we'll do is we'll copy that URL.

255
00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:58.810
We'll go back to our .env

256
00:10:58.810 --> 00:11:03.190
and we will paste that into the data URL.

257
00:11:03.190 --> 00:11:05.240 line:15% 
Then what we need to do is we need

258
00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:07.170 line:15% 
to change the username and the password.

259
00:11:07.170 --> 00:11:10.310 line:15% 
It looks like they've already pre-populated the username.

260
00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:11.570
And then the password

261
00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:15.893
that I have here, we need to put that in.

262
00:11:17.190 --> 00:11:20.360
The angle brackets get deleted along with the word password.

263
00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:21.680
So don't leave them in.

264
00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:23.890
And then paste that in there.

265
00:11:23.890 --> 00:11:26.592
The way that we can test if that has worked

266
00:11:26.592 --> 00:11:29.700
is we can go to our MongoDB Compass

267
00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:36.700
and I'm going to connect to a new connection,

268
00:11:39.250 --> 00:11:40.403
paste that in there.

269
00:11:41.390 --> 00:11:44.010
Oh, oh, we forgot one more thing.

270
00:11:44.010 --> 00:11:46.720
The database name, we forgot to replace that.

271
00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:48.800
So let's do that real quick.

272
00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:50.963
We'll name that sickfits.

273
00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:56.210 line:15% 
That's not something we've specified yet, so that is fine.

274
00:11:56.210 --> 00:11:59.080
So again let's paste that in there.

275
00:11:59.080 --> 00:11:59.913
Connect.

276
00:12:01.910 --> 00:12:02.743
And there we go.

277
00:12:02.743 --> 00:12:05.260
So it has connected to our database.

278
00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:07.920
There's obviously nothing in there yet.

279
00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:10.700
But that just shows that we have correctly connected

280
00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:11.870
to the database

281
00:12:11.870 --> 00:12:14.870
and also we've put this into our .env file.

282
00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:18.040
So let's close up here, close

283
00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:20.740
and we have our cluster, you can click through to that

284
00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:23.917
and we'll be able to see our data in here

285
00:12:23.917 --> 00:12:25.840
and all the other information.

286
00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:28.080
The one I really like is the Performance Adviser.

287
00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:30.530
I don't think it comes with it for free.

288
00:12:30.530 --> 00:12:31.980
I pay for it on my own.

289
00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:33.740
Yeah, you've gotta upgrade for that

290
00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:37.870
but I love it because it will tell me when some sort

291
00:12:37.870 --> 00:12:41.024
of thing I'm doing is slow

292
00:12:41.024 --> 00:12:43.620
and it will tell you how to fix it,

293
00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:45.210
which is really cool.

294
00:12:45.210 --> 00:12:47.830
In Keystone, they do most of the database stuff

295
00:12:47.830 --> 00:12:48.663
under the hood for you.

296
00:12:48.663 --> 00:12:50.800
So you likely won't hit those issues

297
00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:53.530
but overall, it's nice to have.

298
00:12:53.530 --> 00:12:56.189
So that's connecting to MongoDB.

299
00:12:56.189 --> 00:12:58.370
Let's move into the next video

300
00:12:58.370 --> 00:13:00.410
where we actually configure Keystone

301
00:13:00.410 --> 00:13:01.810
to hook up to this database.
