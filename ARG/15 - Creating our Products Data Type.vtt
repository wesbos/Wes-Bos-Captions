00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:02.910
<v Wes>Next up, we're gonna be creating products</v>

2
00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:05.090
and while we'll be able to add them via the Dashboard

3
00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:07.130
we're also gonna learn how to actually add data

4
00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:09.950
from the front end of our actual sick Fitz application.

5
00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:12.090
So the, the sort of the process

6
00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.780
of adding a new piece of data is very much the same.

7
00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.780
Now that we have Keystone set up, we have auth done.

8
00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:22.980
We don't have roles and permissions done yet

9
00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.580
but now every time you want to add a new piece of data

10
00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:27.780
it's pretty much the same, same approach.

11
00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:30.040
So what we're going to do here is we're going to go

12
00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:32.850
to our schemas folder, make a new file.

13
00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.700
Let's call it capital P Product.js, no .ts .

14
00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:38.580
See that's what?

15
00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:40.650
Three times I've done it.

16
00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:45.093
Now, next up, what we want to do is export const.

17
00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:52.630
We'll make it a product and that is a list.

18
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.180
Let's see can we auto import that list?

19
00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:57.180
Boom. Sure can.

20
00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.013
Alright.

21
00:00:58.013 --> 00:01:01.737
Inside that list we have, we'll say TODO Access.

22
00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:07.070
So we'll say access is that,

23
00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:08.820
we'll comment that out for now.

24
00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.470
Just cause we don't, we don't have that yet.

25
00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.150
And then we have fields.

26
00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:14.850
So what fields do we want?

27
00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.280
All we want that product is going to have a name

28
00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.570
which is text and it is all we got to import text.

29
00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:22.403
Yep.

30
00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.750
Boom. Oh, that one auto imported.

31
00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:28.440
Good. I don't know what it is.

32
00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:29.310
Sometimes it works.

33
00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.320
Sometimes it doesn't, but it's getting better.

34
00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:33.210
Is it required?

35
00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.560
Yes, it is.

36
00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:35.980
What else do we got here?

37
00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:38.580
We have the description

38
00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:45.460
and that is also text and the not is required.

39
00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:46.743
That's not tr...

40
00:01:46.743 --> 00:01:48.220
We don't have to pass that one cause it's not.

41
00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:50.960
But we do have to pass some information about the UI

42
00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.880
and the UI is displayMode is going to be whoops.

43
00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.100
Look at that input or text area by default is input

44
00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.560
but we can also set it to texture.

45
00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:04.393
That's see.

46
00:02:04.393 --> 00:02:06.840
That's another really nice thing about TypeScript.

47
00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.450
Is like how did I know that? I didn't.

48
00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.160
I didn't even have to go to the docs for that.

49
00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.310
I didn't have to check

50
00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.500
what the spelling of this was I simply just like,

51
00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.360
Oh, I think it's the Description or displayMode.

52
00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:19.193
Get that.

53
00:02:19.193 --> 00:02:21.180
Boom. And what are my options?

54
00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.100
Oh, text area.

55
00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:23.140
I'm off to the races.

56
00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.070
Okay. So we had our Name, our Description.

57
00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:29.310
We also are going to have a Status Dropdown

58
00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.430
but let's make sure this is just working for now.

59
00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.360
So let's go into our Keystone.js

60
00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.430
Well, let's go to our lists where we already have our user

61
00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.860
and we'll duplicate that and say product, boom.

62
00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:44.730
And so we have our product here.

63
00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.090
Did it auto import? It sure did.

64
00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:49.916
We got a bit of a red underline.

65
00:02:49.916 --> 00:02:51.783
Let's deal with that right now.

66
00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.110
Import should occur after Keystone.

67
00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:56.423
Okay. That's fine.

68
00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:00.030
Usually it fixes itself

69
00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.240
but we'll move it down there and that fixes it.

70
00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:06.700
Okay. Maybe we need to pu pu pu there we go.

71
00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.450
Reorder them for it to be happy.

72
00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.850
Okay. And then we can restart the sucker

73
00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:19.400
and we should see products

74
00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.910
in the sidebar with the fields that we've, we've got so far.

75
00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:24.743
Here we go.

76
00:03:24.743 --> 00:03:28.960
Products. You can create a Product Name, Description.

77
00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:30.290
Let's just say, test.

78
00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:32.543
This is a test product.

79
00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:35.180
Go ahead and create it.

80
00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:37.373
Boom. And we'll go to our products.

81
00:03:37.373 --> 00:03:38.800
Here we go.

82
00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:41.670
But we need more than that than just name and description.

83
00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:45.170
We need a Status because sometimes you want to be working

84
00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:47.030
on adding a product, but you don't want it to show up

85
00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:49.300
on the front end until it is right.

86
00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:54.300
So we can say the Status is going to be a select box.

87
00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:59.410
So let's try import the select box.

88
00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:00.650
Did that work?

89
00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:02.260
Yes it did.

90
00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:07.260
um mm inside of that, we have options

91
00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:10.430
which is an array.

92
00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:15.430
And each of those is an object that has a label of DRAFT

93
00:04:19.185 --> 00:04:22.240
And a value of DRAFT Cal caps.

94
00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:26.273
And then duplicate that we'll call it available.

95
00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:32.220
I just like to do this transform uppercase little shortcut

96
00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:33.490
in VS code.

97
00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:37.720
And then here, we'll just call it Unavailable

98
00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:39.283
and put Un in front of there.

99
00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:46.820
We can give it a default value of draft and let's see

100
00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:47.760
let's see where that gets us.

101
00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:49.610
So there's a couple more options we can give it

102
00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:52.890
but I just like to see the, the basics of it running.

103
00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:53.723
All right, it's running.

104
00:04:53.723 --> 00:04:55.150
So click through to this one.

105
00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:57.773
There we go.

106
00:04:57.773 --> 00:05:00.900
I've got our Status; Draft, Available, Unavailable

107
00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:04.020
and other possible options that we have

108
00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:07.150
is we can have a couple more UI options here.

109
00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:09.020
Say displayMode.

110
00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:11.040
It could be equal to a Select box

111
00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:13.483
which it is or segmented-control.

112
00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:18.160
And then you can also hide it from the Create View.

113
00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:22.410
So if you click on here, Create Product, if like

114
00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:25.490
or if you want to have like a nice, quick Create View

115
00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:28.440
you can just hide specific items from here

116
00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:32.430
because I don't know, maybe there's a hundred fields in it.

117
00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:34.850
You just want to quickly create a product and then go in

118
00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:37.020
to this UI while you do it in the way that we

119
00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:41.300
can do that is I would say create view is equal to

120
00:05:42.339 --> 00:05:45.600
fieldMode is hidden.

121
00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:47.870
You can see what all the possible options are edit

122
00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:49.500
or hidden.

123
00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:50.460
Pretty, it's very simple.

124
00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:53.080
We honestly, we aren't using that all that much

125
00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:54.730
because we're going to be doing most

126
00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:58.320
of the data from the front end of react application.

127
00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:00.820
But I thought I would show you that just because it's

128
00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:03.870
it's neat to know that Keystone has such fine grain control

129
00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:06.400
over this whole admin UI.

130
00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:10.130
So last thing we need here is a price,

131
00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:15.130
which is an integer and that auto imported as well.

132
00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:17.120
Look at that, it auto imports it

133
00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:20.870
from the fields and then we will TODO photo.

134
00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:22.280
We're gonna add a photo

135
00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:24.900
but that's going to be a relationship.

136
00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:27.560
So we will come back to that in the next video.

137
00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:30.420
So kill your build restarted again

138
00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:32.810
see how we get this like Status.

139
00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:35.070
This is like a nice little segment of control.

140
00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:38.730
Instead, you can just quickly change it from one to another.

141
00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:41.320
And then the price I'm going to add.

142
00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:42.810
One thing about those courses.

143
00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:44.780
We are doing prices in cents.

144
00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:48.280
I always do my prices in cents for whenever I do something.

145
00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:49.590
So if it's $24,

146
00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:54.470
it's 2400 cents that allows us to never have to deal

147
00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:57.430
with decimals or rounding issues or anything like that.

148
00:06:57.430 --> 00:07:00.040
You simply just give it a, a nice int.

149
00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:02.080
So that's called an integer versus a float

150
00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:03.470
which would have a decimal.

151
00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:06.190
So available, go ahead and save changes.

152
00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:07.493
Go back to our products.

153
00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:10.860
We have our Name and our Status.

154
00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:13.510
And now if you click Create Product, you see how that

155
00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:15.810
what was this field called?

156
00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:18.580
The Status field is not showing up in this Create View.

157
00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:20.520
That's because we have set the Create View

158
00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:22.330
to fieldMode of hidden.

159
00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:24.270
It only shows up when we get there.

160
00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:25.103
Alright.

161
00:07:25.103 --> 00:07:25.960
So don't create too many products yet

162
00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:28.360
because both I have dummy data for you.

163
00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:30.470
