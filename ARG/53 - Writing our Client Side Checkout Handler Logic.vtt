00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:02.984
<v ->Let's talk about this handleSubmit function.</v>

2
00:00:02.984 --> 00:00:05.880
There's a whole bunch of custom logic and flow

3
00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:07.810
that needs to happen inside of here.

4
00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:09.410
What I'm gonna do is I'm gonna write it all out

5
00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:11.560
in pseudocode and over the next couple of videos,

6
00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:13.710
we're gonna go ahead and implement it one by one.

7
00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.800
So, first thing is,

8
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:19.010
we need to stop the form from submitting

9
00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:23.253
and turn the loader on.

10
00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:25.420
Okay, that's good.

11
00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:28.470
And then, second thing we need to do is to,

12
00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.193
start the page transition.

13
00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.607
Third thing we need to do is to

14
00:00:35.607 --> 00:00:38.383
create the payment method via Stripe.

15
00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:45.793
Fourth thing we need to do is handle any errors from Stripe.

16
00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.920
Those are gonna be errors like,

17
00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.930
credit card is not accepted, it's been declined.

18
00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:55.710
There's not enough currency on it.

19
00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.790
Things like Discover card is not accepted in this country.

20
00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:01.340
All the errors that you could possibly get back

21
00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:03.210
from a credit card processor

22
00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.930
are gonna be handled in that number four,

23
00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:08.610
and then we'll display them to the user.

24
00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.840
The fifth thing is we need to send the token

25
00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:13.760
that just came from step four.

26
00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:18.663
Okay, we'll say token comes back here if successful.

27
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.460
Actually that doesn't happen in the error step,

28
00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:23.950
it happens in right here,

29
00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:25.490
create the payment method.

30
00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.353
So, we will send the token from step three,

31
00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:37.100
to our keystone server via a custom mutation.

32
00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:43.470
And number six, what we need to do is

33
00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.203
change the page to view the order.

34
00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:52.030
So, if they have successfully come back

35
00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:53.380
from sending the token,

36
00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:55.240
what will have happened in step five is that

37
00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.400
we've created an order on the backend.

38
00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.610
And then we wanna change the user to the page,

39
00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.160
so they can view that order

40
00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.293
of any information that they might have.

41
00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:05.483
And then seven,

42
00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:07.313
close the cart,

43
00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:10.000
and eight,

44
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.323
turn the loader off.

45
00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:18.430
All right, so first thing.

46
00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:19.760
Stop the form from submitting

47
00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:20.680
and turn the loader on.

48
00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.290
Okay. So we need our own loading state in this case, Why?

49
00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:28.650
Because, normally we would use the loading state

50
00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.130
from our query or our mutation,

51
00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:32.450
which was happening here.

52
00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.690
But in this case, we need to be basically saying

53
00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:36.330
we're doing a whole bunch of work,

54
00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.230
everywhere from this step to this step.

55
00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:43.890
We need to show the user that something is happening.

56
00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.400
So, if that's the case,

57
00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.070
you need to hold your own piece of state,

58
00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:49.840
both for errors and for loading.

59
00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.740
So, at the very top of your checkout,

60
00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:55.820
we'll say const, error and setError

61
00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:58.803
is equal to useState,

62
00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:04.763
and we gotta import useState from React, good.

63
00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:07.960
And then the next one will be

64
00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:09.663
loading and setLoading,

65
00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:12.403
is equal to useState,

66
00:03:12.403 --> 00:03:16.630
and by default loading is in a false state.

67
00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:17.710
While we're up here,

68
00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:21.220
we'll also get access to our Stripe objects.

69
00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:24.490
So const stripe is equal to useStripe

70
00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:29.490
that is shipped via the React JS Stripe library,

71
00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:30.800
and we're going to use that

72
00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:33.150
in one of the steps down here.

73
00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.440
What is it yelling at us for?

74
00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.630
Cannot find the element in context,

75
00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:39.540
you need to wrap the part of your app,

76
00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:42.300
that calls useStripe in an elements provider.

77
00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:44.670
Ah, I see that's a bit of an issue,

78
00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:47.210
we're trying to say useStripe right here,

79
00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:49.370
but it's not until this

80
00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:51.210
that we actually get access to it.

81
00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:53.210
So the provider is at a lower level

82
00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:54.800
than where we're trying to use it.

83
00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:57.020
So, little solution,

84
00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:01.177
let's rename this checkout component here to CheckoutForm.

85
00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:04.720
And then what we wanna do

86
00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:08.193
is make a new component down here called Checkout.

87
00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:13.517
That is simply just going to return these two,

88
00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:16.743
so the Stripe element provider,

89
00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:20.700
and then inside of that

90
00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:22.753
we'll render out the CheckoutForm.

91
00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:28.800
Okay. So what happened there is,

92
00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.020
we redid the Checkout component.

93
00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:33.720
It's still the thing that's exported from this file,

94
00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.753
but because we need access to this useStripe,

95
00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:39.610
this checkout form needs to be wrapped

96
00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:42.500
in that elements provider.

97
00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:44.250
So, we just put it in its own component

98
00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:46.180
and render that with child inside of it,

99
00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:49.720
and therefore, the provider is at a higher level

100
00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:50.553
that we have that.

101
00:04:50.553 --> 00:04:53.730
Okay. So that's not no longer giving us grief,

102
00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:55.210
about any of that stuff.

103
00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:56.960
Good, we can still render that out.

104
00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:02.110
So, we have our loading state.

105
00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:05.020
So, we'll go right here,

106
00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:06.240
stop the form 'cause it ain't good,

107
00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:09.763
and then we'll say setLoading is true.

108
00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:13.960
We gotta start the page transition.

109
00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:14.980
So, we'll go here

110
00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:19.430
and we'll say nProgress.start

111
00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:21.993
and we'll need to import nProgress.

112
00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:25.030
Take a look here, there we go.

113
00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:26.183
It's being imported.

114
00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:32.150
And I think this should start working already.

115
00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:33.890
So, if I go ahead and submit it,

116
00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:36.660
see the nProgress starts going,

117
00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:37.720
it will just inch along

118
00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:40.313
until it eventually decides to stop.

119
00:05:40.313 --> 00:05:42.940
'Cause we're not actually doing anything behind,

120
00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:45.170
but that's working.

121
00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:47.990
Next one, create the payment method via Stripe.

122
00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:51.260
Token comes back here if successful.

123
00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.310
Okay. So this is where we got that

124
00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:55.680
interface with our Stripe library.

125
00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:58.150
So, the method we're gonna be calling is,

126
00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:00.530
stripe.createPaymentMethod.

127
00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:04.620
And that will take a couple options.

128
00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:05.520
Basically just say,

129
00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:07.520
the type is a card

130
00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:09.750
because Stripe will also let you pay

131
00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:11.880
via a couple other options,

132
00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:16.400
AHC, ACH, Automatic Clearing House.

133
00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:17.780
Yeah, we don't have that in Canada,

134
00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:19.710
but that's a very popular way.

135
00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:21.060
Debit cards, things like that

136
00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:22.840
in our case we're doing credit card.

137
00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:25.080
And then the actual card is,

138
00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:30.080
you just give it reference to the actual Stripe elements,

139
00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:32.090
which is available down here.

140
00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:33.930
So we say elements,

141
00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:36.760
and that element is gonna be available via another hook.

142
00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:38.020
So, we gotta go back up here,

143
00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:40.780
const elements is equal to useElements

144
00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:45.620
and that auto imported from the,

145
00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:49.330
again from the Stripe React JS library.

146
00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:51.550
I'll say elements.getElement,

147
00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:53.737
and then you pass it, cardElement.

148
00:06:56.055 --> 00:06:58.490
And it is smart enough to know,

149
00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:00.780
that you're only allowed to render out

150
00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:03.150
one of those card elements on the page.

151
00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:04.730
So, you don't have to actually have a ref

152
00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:07.360
or anything like that, between those.

153
00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:09.130
Now, this is in asynchronous function,

154
00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:10.920
so we'll put an await in front of it.

155
00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:12.140
And from that it,

156
00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:14.680
what is returned is,

157
00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:17.000
so say const error.

158
00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.130
So if there's any errors

159
00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:20.190
they will be returned as a value here,

160
00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:21.140
which is really nice.

161
00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:22.780
So, you don't have to catch them.

162
00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:25.702
And then payment method is going to be,

163
00:07:25.702 --> 00:07:27.900
have the token that's on it.

164
00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:31.523
So, go ahead and console.log the payment method,

165
00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:36.670
Just to see what we're working with.

166
00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:38.830
And we need to,

167
00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:40.653
Oh, it's giving me some grief.

168
00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:46.440
Oh, await is only allowed inside of an async function.

169
00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:47.933
We forgot to make this async.

170
00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:52.750
Oh no, not that one, not the component,

171
00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:54.693
the handle submit needs to be async.

172
00:08:02.879 --> 00:08:06.060
Give it a refresh, open it up.

173
00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:09.330
Now, there is a whole bunch of Stripe test cards

174
00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:10.330
that you can use,

175
00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:13.440
to test successful transactions.

176
00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:16.713
If you just Google Stripe test cards,

177
00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:22.270
you'll see that there's a whole page of different cards

178
00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:26.050
that will say no authentication required,

179
00:08:26.050 --> 00:08:29.790
authentication required, Visa, MasterCard,

180
00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:34.790
Discover, international cards, 3D secure testing cards,

181
00:08:36.410 --> 00:08:38.001
specific responses and errors,

182
00:08:38.001 --> 00:08:40.810
it's nuts how many they can possibly have.

183
00:08:40.810 --> 00:08:44.240
And they also have cards that will throw specific errors,

184
00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:45.543
so you can handle them.

185
00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:48.500
And, but in our case they always just send

186
00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:50.060
a really good message back to the user.

187
00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:51.860
So, I've even in my own website,

188
00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:53.390
i've not needed to use those.

189
00:08:53.390 --> 00:08:56.650
The only one that I need to use is

190
00:08:56.650 --> 00:08:58.790
four two four two, four two four two,

191
00:08:58.790 --> 00:09:00.100
four two four two.

192
00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:05.100
And I have a little keyboard shortcut in my text expander,

193
00:09:05.570 --> 00:09:08.320
is any time i type colon four two,

194
00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:10.456
it'll just expand to four two four two four two four two

195
00:09:10.456 --> 00:09:11.990
four two four two four two.

196
00:09:11.990 --> 00:09:14.010
So, I wonder what the captions were

197
00:09:14.010 --> 00:09:15.330
like when I was saying that.

198
00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:19.190
Four two, and then month, two two two.

199
00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:22.620
So if you're taking this after February 2022,

200
00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:24.290
sorry, you'll have to change that.

201
00:09:24.290 --> 00:09:27.410
Two two two, two two two two two.

202
00:09:27.410 --> 00:09:31.160
And I love that because I can just hold on to my two key

203
00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:32.320
and it will work out.

204
00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:33.970
So, I'm gonna open up my dev tools here

205
00:09:33.970 --> 00:09:35.763
and go ahead and submit that.

206
00:09:36.901 --> 00:09:39.030
It says we gotta do some work and good bam

207
00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:40.840
oh, it just after a split second,

208
00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:43.960
what comes back is this object here.

209
00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:45.337
And this is the information

210
00:09:45.337 --> 00:09:48.740
that comes back from Stripe.

211
00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:51.530
You can tell that it says live mode is false,

212
00:09:51.530 --> 00:09:53.800
object is payment method.

213
00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:56.010
The most important one is this ID.

214
00:09:56.010 --> 00:09:58.770
This is your actual, your token

215
00:09:58.770 --> 00:10:00.630
that we're going to be using.

216
00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:02.460
So, we'll head back to this

217
00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:04.050
and keep going through all of them.

218
00:10:04.050 --> 00:10:06.170
So handle any errors that are from Stripe.

219
00:10:06.170 --> 00:10:09.850
So we'll say, if there is an error, then setError

220
00:10:11.130 --> 00:10:13.960
and then we can go back down,

221
00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:15.680
right above this card element,

222
00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:17.630
and we'll give ourselves a little

223
00:10:17.630 --> 00:10:19.450
if statement that says error.

224
00:10:19.450 --> 00:10:20.840
If there is an error,

225
00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:24.100
then go ahead and give yourself a paragraph

226
00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:26.380
with the error.message.

227
00:10:26.380 --> 00:10:28.770
And I believe we can find one of those test cards

228
00:10:28.770 --> 00:10:32.320
that will give you a, an actual error.

229
00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:37.040
IntegrationError can only create one element of type card.

230
00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:38.380
Oh, sometimes that pops up.

231
00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:41.140
Sometimes it has, I think because of the dance

232
00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:44.080
that we do back and forth between Next JS and whatnot,

233
00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:46.240
but don't sweat about that.

234
00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:48.700
It's probably because of the live reloading

235
00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:51.040
and whatnot, that that pops up.

236
00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:53.320
But let's take a look at these tests and cards.

237
00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:58.320
There should be an error card.

238
00:10:59.430 --> 00:11:00.420
Here we go.

239
00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:03.943
We'll, this one will fail with an error.

240
00:11:05.690 --> 00:11:07.103
So, go back,

241
00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:09.693
try to use that card.

242
00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:14.570
Check it out

243
00:11:14.570 --> 00:11:16.680
and (laughs)

244
00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:18.160
it just says error.message,

245
00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:21.283
because I forgot to put curly brackets around it.

246
00:11:22.543 --> 00:11:23.376
Here we go,

247
00:11:23.376 --> 00:11:24.940
your postal code is incomplete.

248
00:11:24.940 --> 00:11:26.010
So there we go.

249
00:11:26.010 --> 00:11:29.580
Actually in this case, the payment did go through,

250
00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:31.490
but you can see how we can catch errors

251
00:11:31.490 --> 00:11:33.350
and actually display it to the user.

252
00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:37.683
That text is very large.

253
00:11:39.170 --> 00:11:41.150
So, we probably wanna make that

254
00:11:41.150 --> 00:11:42.770
a little bit smaller.

255
00:11:42.770 --> 00:11:45.760
You can, I'm just gonna do a quick little hack here.

256
00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:47.850
You could make a custom stock component,

257
00:11:47.850 --> 00:11:50.253
but I'm just gonna say font size is 12.

258
00:11:51.310 --> 00:11:52.633
There we go, much better.

259
00:11:57.670 --> 00:12:00.830
Next up, send the token from step three

260
00:12:00.830 --> 00:12:01.710
to our keystone server.

261
00:12:01.710 --> 00:12:03.670
Okay, we'll get into that in a second.

262
00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:05.250
Change the page, we'll get into that.

263
00:12:05.250 --> 00:12:06.970
Close the cart.

264
00:12:06.970 --> 00:12:09.890
We'll get into that if it's successful.

265
00:12:09.890 --> 00:12:14.070
So we can, and then finally turn the loader off.

266
00:12:14.070 --> 00:12:18.253
So, we'll say setLoading is false.

267
00:12:21.007 --> 00:12:26.007
And then we also want to say nProgress.done.

268
00:12:28.110 --> 00:12:30.590
Okay, so that's not totally flashed out just yet,

269
00:12:30.590 --> 00:12:32.250
but I think that's enough for this video.

270
00:12:32.250 --> 00:12:33.210
In the next one,

271
00:12:33.210 --> 00:12:35.060
we'll have to start getting into the backend,

272
00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:37.943
and writing some custom mutations for that spot.
