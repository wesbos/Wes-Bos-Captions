00:00:01.690 --> 00:00:03.300
<v Instructor>All right, there's the saying</v>

2
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.280
is the hardest things in computer science

3
00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:08.050
is naming things in cache invalidation.

4
00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:10.470
And we're gonna be going up against the second thing

5
00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:12.010
which is cache invalidation.

6
00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:14.440
What happens when you delete an item

7
00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:16.000
when you have pagination?

8
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.680
So let me show you right away

9
00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.100
how Apollo is currently handling the cache.

10
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.220
If we go over to Apollo DevTools here,

11
00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:23.460
we go to our cache,

12
00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.950
you'll see that when we query some products,

13
00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:28.770
previously they're all just put under all products.

14
00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:32.690
Now, when we query some products

15
00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:35.140
it uses the actual query itself

16
00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:37.970
as a key to store the products.

17
00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:40.250
And if I go onto the next page here,

18
00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.570
of course the DevTools aren't working,

19
00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.770
I got to close it, open it up again,

20
00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:46.320
go back to my cache, there we go.

21
00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.110
You see that now the third and fourth products

22
00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:52.053
are under their own key.

23
00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.550
And this can be a bit of an issue for a number of reasons.

24
00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.360
First of all this product, this one right here

25
00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.570
that's the suitcase right here.

26
00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.460
And if we want it to query this suitcase again

27
00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.160
somewhere else, like if we wanted to put it in that order

28
00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.060
or we wanted to put it in a pop-up

29
00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.950
or put it in a footer or anywhere else

30
00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:16.523
we needed this piece of data,

31
00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:19.230
our query is gonna be like product

32
00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:22.860
with an ID of 5fc95 et cetera, et cetera.

33
00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.540
And that's not the same query as this.

34
00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:27.940
So it's actually not going to

35
00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:30.553
know that it has that item in the cache.

36
00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.000
It's gonna go to the network and grab it again.

37
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.810
So what we could do is we can say, all right,

38
00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.810
we actually don't want to use these first and skip values

39
00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:44.530
as part of the key when storing it in our Apollo cache.

40
00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.610
We wanna stick them all in one big list of products.

41
00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.410
And then we want to control ourselves

42
00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:57.250
how these products are both fetched from the network

43
00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:58.890
as well as return from the cache

44
00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.210
so we can display them on the page.

45
00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:03.370
So I'm gonna say right up front

46
00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:04.650
this is gonna be a hard video.

47
00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:06.720
This is the hard part for me.

48
00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.810
There's still some weird oddities in it

49
00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:10.950
that I couldn't fix myself.

50
00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.400
I had probably six or seven calls

51
00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.580
with various people on the Apollo Dev team

52
00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.250
and they can't figure it out either.

53
00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.703
So I'm just gonna put it out there this this sucks to me.

54
00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.100
But this is how it works

55
00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:26.330
and this is what we gotta do

56
00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:27.820
to make it work in the pagination.

57
00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:32.130
Just know that this is not my half-assed approach at it.

58
00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:35.030
This is just how the library works.

59
00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.970
So the idea here is that when we delete an item, delete

60
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.560
what needs to happen is that

61
00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.350
that item needs to be deleted from the cache.

62
00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:46.060
And when that happens

63
00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.670
all the other items need to come sliding forward, right?

64
00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:52.210
Like if we've got item one, two, three, four, five, six

65
00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:53.850
and we delete item four.

66
00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:55.490
What needs to happen as you delete it?

67
00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:57.100
Now we have an empty spot

68
00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.980
so then it needs to be brought back up.

69
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.350
Now, if we do that with pages like these

70
00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:04.513
let's say these dashes are pages here.

71
00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:08.340
What happens is if you delete item four

72
00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.890
now five needs to go on that page

73
00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:14.000
and six needs to be on this page by itself.

74
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.690
So the question is like, okay,

75
00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:21.570
like what do you do to actually handle that?

76
00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:24.690
There's like one option is you could refresh the queries

77
00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:26.810
but there's a problem with that

78
00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:30.270
because we don't know what all the queries are.

79
00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:34.870
The second option is put all the products in one big list.

80
00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:36.500
And then by doing that,

81
00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.630
we ends up we just delete one item from that product list

82
00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:42.730
and everything will bump itself up.

83
00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:45.793
So there still is a couple of little edge cases around it.

84
00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:51.820
There also is, one more option is when you delete an item

85
00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.940
another option is just go nuclear and delete everything

86
00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:58.830
meaning that, okay, the items or the products

87
00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:00.220
on the page have changed,

88
00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:02.010
just scrub them all from cache

89
00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:04.090
and then as the person pages through,

90
00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:07.390
then we can just fetch them again.

91
00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:09.320
And that's actually quite a good option

92
00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:11.350
meaning like let's just delete all the products

93
00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:13.730
and then get them back from the network.

94
00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:16.140
The only issue with that is that Apollo doesn't have,

95
00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:18.780
they haven't a way to delete one item, which is evict.

96
00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:19.970
We just use that.

97
00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:23.300
And then they have a way to delete the entire cache

98
00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:24.860
which is this entire thing

99
00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:26.870
but they don't have a way currently

100
00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:31.870
to delete all items in the cache of a certain type

101
00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:34.770
meaning that like you can't just delete all the products.

102
00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:38.250
You have to delete the metadata here,

103
00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:40.820
you have to delete who's currently logged in.

104
00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:42.750
You have to delete any other piece of data

105
00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:43.670
in your application.

106
00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:45.340
And that is a bit nuclear to me

107
00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:47.997
because you don't necessarily wanna do that, right?

108
00:04:47.997 --> 00:04:49.297
And then you have to have a huge

109
00:04:49.297 --> 00:04:52.030
you're basically resetting the entire application.

110
00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:55.840
So with that said, buckle up

111
00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:57.880
and we're gonna start writing it ourselves.

112
00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:59.730
So the way that you do that

113
00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:03.700
is with this thing called type policies in Apollo.

114
00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:06.450
Now, Apollo here we have this in-memory cache,

115
00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:08.610
go to your widthdata.js

116
00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:10.480
and we have these different fields.

117
00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:11.530
These are fields in here.

118
00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:16.530
And basically we say when a field comes in

119
00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:19.640
which in our case is gonna be all products

120
00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:21.570
let me manage it myself.

121
00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:23.350
Instead of you doing the default

122
00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:26.020
which is taking all of the variables

123
00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:27.460
that are passed to that query

124
00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:29.860
and using that to sort of split them up,

125
00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:32.320
let me handle it myself.

126
00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:34.770
So what we're gonna do here is let's uncomment that

127
00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:37.810
so all products is going to be handled

128
00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:39.560
by a pagination field.

129
00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:42.730
Then we're gonna go ahead and write that thing ourselves.

130
00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:45.763
So let's go into our lib folder.

131
00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:51.200
Make a new file and call it paginationField.js

132
00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:59.297
and export default paginationField.

133
00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:07.660
Now, from that we're gonna return an object

134
00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:13.700
that has a read function and a merge function.

135
00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:17.390
Give that a save.

136
00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:21.510
I'll go back into our data and import this pagination field.

137
00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:22.583
Boom, okay.

138
00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:25.543
And I think now if we,

139
00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:28.620
Oh, did I forget the word function?

140
00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:29.940
I always forget the word function.

141
00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:32.560
There's a lot of things to pop in here.

142
00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:33.393
There we go.

143
00:06:33.393 --> 00:06:36.540
I think now if we refresh our app, we get nothing, right?

144
00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:41.483
Because we are not returning or merging any products.

145
00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:47.410
So the way that this read and merge works

146
00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:52.140
is that when Apollo tries to query for all products

147
00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:56.720
it is first going to first thing it does

148
00:06:56.720 --> 00:07:01.720
is asks the read function for those items.

149
00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:07.910
Here, we can either do one of two things.

150
00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:14.220
First thing we can do is return the items

151
00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:19.220
because they are already in the cache, okay?

152
00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:21.630
The other thing we can do,

153
00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:26.630
the other thing we can do is to return a false from here.

154
00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:33.600
And what that will do is that will make a network request

155
00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:37.080
meaning that if we run this field here

156
00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:41.360
and Apollo says, "Please may I have the products?"

157
00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:44.220
It will first run a read function.

158
00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:48.470
And then if we figure out by looking at the cache

159
00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:51.040
saying that there are no items in the cache,

160
00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:53.740
then what we're gonna do here is we return false

161
00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:56.030
and what Apollo will do, it says, okay, well

162
00:07:56.030 --> 00:07:57.450
they didn't give me anything.

163
00:07:57.450 --> 00:07:59.660
So I'm gonna go to the network

164
00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:02.430
meaning that I'm gonna go to our Keystone database

165
00:08:02.430 --> 00:08:04.250
and try to fetch the items.

166
00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:07.200
Then when it comes back from the database with the items,

167
00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:11.150
it says, "Hey,I know you told me we didn't have

168
00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:12.430
any of the items.

169
00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:15.040
So I went to the network and got some myself,

170
00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:16.220
here they are."

171
00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:18.370
And you're gonna run a merge function.

172
00:08:18.370 --> 00:08:23.370
It says, this runs when the Apollo client comes back

173
00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:29.663
from the network with our products.

174
00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:31.860
And then basically we're saying

175
00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:33.730
what the merge function is

176
00:08:33.730 --> 00:08:37.320
like how do you wanna put them into the cache?

177
00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:38.680
Like where do you wanna put them?

178
00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:41.000
In what order do you wanna put them?

179
00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.470
All the things like that.

180
00:08:43.470 --> 00:08:46.000
Okay, so let's go into here.

181
00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.793
Above this read function, we need to say keyArgs is false.

182
00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:56.223
And what this will do is it tells Apollo,

183
00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:59.903
we will take care of everything.

184
00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:06.550
Then inside the read function here

185
00:09:06.550 --> 00:09:08.210
it gives us a couple arguments.

186
00:09:08.210 --> 00:09:10.450
It gives us the existing items

187
00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:16.350
and we'll set that to be just a default of an array.

188
00:09:16.350 --> 00:09:18.840
So any items that are already in the cache

189
00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:21.060
it gives us the existing items here.

190
00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:23.880
And then the second argument, it gives us is an object.

191
00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:25.930
So we wanna actually destructure that object.

192
00:09:25.930 --> 00:09:30.177
So curly brackets, and we wanna grab the args

193
00:09:31.290 --> 00:09:33.730
and the cache itself.

194
00:09:33.730 --> 00:09:36.020
and the args and the cache are gonna be,

195
00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:40.200
the args is gonna be the first in the skip values

196
00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:44.640
that we were asking for in our products

197
00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:48.130
and the cache is gonna be the Apollo cache that we have.

198
00:09:48.130 --> 00:09:53.130
So right here, if we log out existing args and cache,

199
00:09:56.950 --> 00:09:58.420
we could probably see what we get here.

200
00:09:58.420 --> 00:10:00.763
Go to our console, give it a refresh.

201
00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:02.433
There we go.

202
00:10:02.433 --> 00:10:05.950
So existing is an empty array.

203
00:10:05.950 --> 00:10:08.930
The arguments is, give me the first two and skip two

204
00:10:08.930 --> 00:10:11.760
that's because we're on page two.

205
00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:16.410
And then the cache is just a reference to the Apollo cache

206
00:10:16.410 --> 00:10:19.653
which we can use to query all of our items.

207
00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:22.520
So let's go on the first line here

208
00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:25.653
and just say, const skip.

209
00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:30.730
And first is equal to args

210
00:10:30.730 --> 00:10:34.490
and that just restructures the skipping first properties

211
00:10:34.490 --> 00:10:37.970
into their own values so that we can have them in here.

212
00:10:37.970 --> 00:10:42.970
And then what we need to do is read the number of items

213
00:10:43.450 --> 00:10:48.450
on the page from the cache const data.

214
00:10:48.990 --> 00:10:52.140
And if you wanna pull data out of your cache,

215
00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:54.033
it looks like this cache.readQuery.

216
00:10:57.310 --> 00:11:00.890
And you actually have to pass a graph QL query.

217
00:11:00.890 --> 00:11:05.500
So what we'll do here is we'll say query

218
00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:09.680
and just a GQL, you could also import this

219
00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:13.663
directly from our pagination field.

220
00:11:17.570 --> 00:11:18.910
Let's take a look here.

221
00:11:18.910 --> 00:11:22.120
This is actually the query that we want.

222
00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:25.940
So what we could do is we pop an export in front of that.

223
00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:28.350
And let's just import that pagination query here

224
00:11:28.350 --> 00:11:31.393
so we actually don't need to do that.

225
00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:38.980
Now we need to import that into this file.

226
00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:41.560
My auto import is not working

227
00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:43.700
so we'll go ahead and import it ourselves.

228
00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:48.050
So import pagination query from up

229
00:11:50.630 --> 00:11:53.543
into components to pagination.

230
00:11:57.890 --> 00:12:00.770
And we can just console.log the data

231
00:12:00.770 --> 00:12:02.093
that comes back from that.

232
00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:10.580
And here we go, object all products meta

233
00:12:11.060 --> 00:12:12.240
and it gives us the count

234
00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:14.790
of the number of items that we have.

235
00:12:14.790 --> 00:12:17.320
So let's say const count

236
00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:22.320
is equal to data dot underscore all products meta.count.

237
00:12:25.430 --> 00:12:27.440
And there's a possibility that

238
00:12:28.550 --> 00:12:31.150
these will not exist just yet.

239
00:12:31.150 --> 00:12:33.270
So by putting question marks on there

240
00:12:33.270 --> 00:12:36.610
what we're doing is we're making sure it doesn't break

241
00:12:36.610 --> 00:12:38.660
by having data as undefined.

242
00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:41.540
That question mark is a new thing in JavaScript.

243
00:12:41.540 --> 00:12:44.700
And what it does it first checks if that value is there

244
00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:46.180
and then it checks if that value is there

245
00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:49.940
and then finally it grabs the count value off of that.

246
00:12:49.940 --> 00:12:52.430
Next we need to calculate what page we are currently on.

247
00:12:52.430 --> 00:12:54.640
So say const page is equal to

248
00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:57.893
skip divided by first plus one.

249
00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:03.633
And how many pages in total is equal to math.ceil.

250
00:13:03.633 --> 00:13:08.260
We already did this once before, say count divided by first

251
00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:11.143
and that will give us how many pages we are on.

252
00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:17.470
Now, we say check if we have existing items,

253
00:13:17.470 --> 00:13:19.400
that's what is next.

254
00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:23.973
So const items is equal to existing.slice.

255
00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:27.610
We'll start at the skip value.

256
00:13:27.610 --> 00:13:30.830
Start at two and then how many do we wanna go for

257
00:13:30.830 --> 00:13:35.570
when we take our skip value and plus the first.

258
00:13:35.570 --> 00:13:37.170
And what that will do is it says

259
00:13:38.180 --> 00:13:41.410
give me start at two and go until you hit four.

260
00:13:41.410 --> 00:13:43.430
And that will give us the two items in our case

261
00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:45.080
because we're doing two per page.

262
00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:50.870
Then we wanna do a quick little filter on them

263
00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:53.240
and that is because it's possible

264
00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:55.380
that these items are going to be undefined.

265
00:13:55.380 --> 00:13:57.240
We'll hit that in just a second

266
00:13:57.240 --> 00:13:59.230
and we'll just return the item.

267
00:13:59.230 --> 00:14:01.880
And if that is undefined it will filter it out

268
00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:04.750
from the list of items that we have there.

269
00:14:04.750 --> 00:14:07.780
Next we wanna check if there are existing items,

270
00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:09.320
oh sorry, if there are not existing items

271
00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:10.530
and we'll send them to the network.

272
00:14:10.530 --> 00:14:13.620
So we'll say if the items.length.

273
00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:17.170
So if the items that we pulled from the existing cache

274
00:14:17.170 --> 00:14:22.170
does not equal the first variable that we have,

275
00:14:23.810 --> 00:14:28.550
that means we don't have any items,

276
00:14:28.550 --> 00:14:32.403
we must go to the network to fetch them.

277
00:14:33.910 --> 00:14:36.910
So here we'll say return false, right?

278
00:14:36.910 --> 00:14:38.770
What that will do is it will say, "Hey"

279
00:14:38.770 --> 00:14:42.520
which we looked, we looked in the cache, there are no items.

280
00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:44.005
Go to the network, go get 'em yourself

281
00:14:44.005 --> 00:14:46.323
'cause I certainly don't have them.

282
00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:51.970
Then here we'll say is, if there are items

283
00:14:51.970 --> 00:14:55.770
just return them from the cache

284
00:14:55.770 --> 00:15:00.160
and we don't need to go to the network.

285
00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:02.573
Say if the items.length,

286
00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:06.633
simply just console log.

287
00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:14.350
There are, and we'll log it out items.length

288
00:15:14.350 --> 00:15:19.350
items in the cache, gonna send them to Apollo.

289
00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:23.623
And then we return items.

290
00:15:24.750 --> 00:15:27.460
Finally, if either of those if statements don't work

291
00:15:27.460 --> 00:15:29.063
we just return false.

292
00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:34.580
And that will just fall back to network

293
00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:38.433
just in case either of those if statements don't work out.

294
00:15:40.380 --> 00:15:42.800
All right, so now if you refresh, the whole thing is broken.

295
00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:43.680
It still doesn't work.

296
00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:46.060
And that's because we're in this state right now.

297
00:15:46.060 --> 00:15:48.440
When you come from a hard refresh,

298
00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:52.330
we're in this state right here where we don't have any items

299
00:15:52.330 --> 00:15:54.300
or we don't have enough items

300
00:15:54.300 --> 00:15:58.280
and what that does is it will send us back to the network.

301
00:15:58.280 --> 00:16:02.470
So what that will do is it'll fetch the network

302
00:16:02.470 --> 00:16:05.050
and then we go to the merge request.

303
00:16:05.050 --> 00:16:06.990
And the merge request is what runs

304
00:16:06.990 --> 00:16:10.000
when we come back from the network with our items.

305
00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.580
So what we do here is you get the existing cache

306
00:16:13.610 --> 00:16:17.060
and we get the incoming new items.

307
00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:20.570
And then we get the args of the query

308
00:16:20.570 --> 00:16:22.120
as well in the third one,

309
00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:24.490
that's part of a property on an object that comes in

310
00:16:24.490 --> 00:16:26.130
so we destructure that here.

311
00:16:26.130 --> 00:16:27.760
So we'll do right here.

312
00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:29.323
Once I console.log,

313
00:16:30.340 --> 00:16:33.840
merging items from the network.

314
00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:37.657
And we could even say incoming.length.

315
00:16:47.530 --> 00:16:50.460
And here we go, look at this merging items from the network.

316
00:16:50.460 --> 00:16:51.870
Why is that happening?

317
00:16:51.870 --> 00:16:56.550
Well, because the read returns false right here.

318
00:16:56.550 --> 00:16:58.100
So it says, all right, go to the network.

319
00:16:58.100 --> 00:16:59.997
And then the network comes back and says,

320
00:16:59.997 --> 00:17:03.020
"All right, I went to the network and I got them.

321
00:17:03.020 --> 00:17:05.930
Here they are, they are incoming." Right?

322
00:17:05.930 --> 00:17:10.293
And if we were to log out the incoming items ourselves,

323
00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:20.140
we should see them somewhere in here.

324
00:17:20.140 --> 00:17:21.923
Here we go. There's the two items.

325
00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:27.880
And they are just refs to the actual products themselves

326
00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:31.000
and the value should be in our Apollo cache.

327
00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:32.340
So what we can do here

328
00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:38.760
is save, const merged is equal to,

329
00:17:42.890 --> 00:17:47.010
if there are existing items in the cache already,

330
00:17:47.010 --> 00:17:51.060
then we will take a copy of the existing.slice

331
00:17:54.290 --> 00:17:56.170
And we grab 'em all.

332
00:17:56.170 --> 00:17:58.933
Otherwise we just want empty array.

333
00:18:02.180 --> 00:18:04.940
Then this is gonna be a little bit weird.

334
00:18:04.940 --> 00:18:07.120
You think you might just be like rest,

335
00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:12.120
just push those new items into the array and call it a day.

336
00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:15.450
But the reason why this doesn't work

337
00:18:15.450 --> 00:18:18.963
is because if somebody, let's go to this blank page again.

338
00:18:20.170 --> 00:18:22.620
Imagine we have one, two, three, four, five,

339
00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:24.680
six, seven eight, nine, 10.

340
00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:27.650
So if somebody starts on page one

341
00:18:27.650 --> 00:18:29.940
and you're gonna fetch items one and two.

342
00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:32.030
And then they go to page two and they get three and four

343
00:18:32.030 --> 00:18:34.510
and then go five and six and seven and eight.

344
00:18:34.510 --> 00:18:35.343
But what happens

345
00:18:35.343 --> 00:18:37.570
if somebody goes to the fourth page directly?

346
00:18:37.570 --> 00:18:38.890
Like someone says, "Hey, check this out,"

347
00:18:38.890 --> 00:18:40.930
and they link them to the fourth page?

348
00:18:40.930 --> 00:18:42.340
Okay, that's a bit of a problem

349
00:18:42.340 --> 00:18:47.070
because we still need these items to exist in these slots.

350
00:18:47.070 --> 00:18:50.660
But since they're coming directly to that page

351
00:18:50.660 --> 00:18:53.330
these items have never been fetched before.

352
00:18:53.330 --> 00:18:55.186
So what we essentially need to do

353
00:18:55.186 --> 00:19:00.186
is put blank spots wherever those items are going to be

354
00:19:04.130 --> 00:19:07.600
like that and then slot in the two merged items

355
00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:08.433
that we have.

356
00:19:08.433 --> 00:19:11.380
And then the forward ones don't really matter

357
00:19:11.380 --> 00:19:12.670
because we're not going forward.

358
00:19:12.670 --> 00:19:15.690
We just need to know about the previous ones.

359
00:19:15.690 --> 00:19:18.540
So the way that we do that is with a four loop.

360
00:19:18.540 --> 00:19:19.940
This is a little bit funky as well.

361
00:19:19.940 --> 00:19:22.790
This is why I'm like I'm sorry

362
00:19:22.790 --> 00:19:24.990
for this part of the tutorial that it's like this

363
00:19:24.990 --> 00:19:27.960
but again, this is how it's done.

364
00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:31.660
We'd say, let i is equal to the skip value that comes in.

365
00:19:31.660 --> 00:19:35.350
Oh, we need to grab our skip and first value.

366
00:19:35.350 --> 00:19:39.740
So const skip and first is equal to args.

367
00:19:39.740 --> 00:19:41.743
We destructure that from our arguments.

368
00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:45.920
So let i is equal to skip.

369
00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:49.970
I, well i is less than skip

370
00:19:51.470 --> 00:19:56.470
plus the incoming.length and then plus, plus i.

371
00:19:58.850 --> 00:20:03.850
Then we say the merged i is equal to incoming

372
00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:07.020
i minus skip.

373
00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:09.560
And I'll show you visually what this is doing

374
00:20:09.560 --> 00:20:10.660
in just a second.

375
00:20:10.660 --> 00:20:12.670
So what we do here is if we were don't,

376
00:20:12.670 --> 00:20:14.370
oh we got to take this push out.

377
00:20:14.370 --> 00:20:16.320
We don't actually need that.

378
00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:20.940
And if we were to console.log are merged now

379
00:20:20.940 --> 00:20:24.810
and then finally underneath that return merged.

380
00:20:24.810 --> 00:20:26.650
And what this will do is

381
00:20:26.650 --> 00:20:31.643
finally we return the merged items from the cache.

382
00:20:35.010 --> 00:20:39.380
And what Apollo will do is when you return from emerge

383
00:20:39.380 --> 00:20:43.570
it will back to the read function and try it again.

384
00:20:43.570 --> 00:20:45.510
So it does a read function.

385
00:20:45.510 --> 00:20:48.120
If it has nothing, it returns false,

386
00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:50.050
then it goes down to the merge.

387
00:20:50.050 --> 00:20:52.700
And then when the merge returns items

388
00:20:52.700 --> 00:20:54.457
the read function runs again and says,

389
00:20:54.457 --> 00:20:58.610
"Hi, I went to the network, let's try this again."

390
00:20:58.610 --> 00:21:00.670
And if you return false from this

391
00:21:00.670 --> 00:21:02.990
then you just have an infinite loop of network request.

392
00:21:02.990 --> 00:21:05.030
But ideally what will happen is you have

393
00:21:05.030 --> 00:21:06.610
you do have items now

394
00:21:06.610 --> 00:21:09.080
and then you can return them from here.

395
00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:11.480
So it goes, read, merge, read.

396
00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:14.100
If there are items in the cache, it's just read.

397
00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:17.220
Otherwise, if it goes to network, it's read, merge, read.

398
00:21:17.220 --> 00:21:19.470
So I'll give that a save us a lotta code we wrote.

399
00:21:19.470 --> 00:21:22.450
Let's see here what we got, give it a refresh.

400
00:21:22.450 --> 00:21:23.513
Got an issue here.

401
00:21:25.150 --> 00:21:29.020
Invalid left-hand side in prefix operation.

402
00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:30.840
What did we do here?

403
00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:33.143
Oh, that should not be one, that's i.

404
00:21:35.509 --> 00:21:37.400
(laughing) Okay, it worked.

405
00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:40.400
Now, what's important about that now

406
00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:45.220
is if we go to our Apollo cache here, go to our cache.

407
00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:50.220
You'll see that the all products is the first two are null

408
00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:54.410
and then the second two are the actual products

409
00:21:54.410 --> 00:21:57.660
that came in and that's because I went to page two directly.

410
00:21:57.660 --> 00:22:00.220
If I go now go to page three,

411
00:22:00.220 --> 00:22:01.490
those items should be in the cache

412
00:22:01.490 --> 00:22:03.950
if the Apollo Dev tools worked.

413
00:22:03.950 --> 00:22:05.423
Open it up again.

414
00:22:07.066 --> 00:22:09.280
Here we go you see those items are in there.

415
00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:11.693
Let me go to the very last page here.

416
00:22:13.380 --> 00:22:15.460
And, the last page has issue.

417
00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:17.330
Let's go to page six.

418
00:22:17.330 --> 00:22:20.030
And then if we go to the Apollo Dev tools and cache

419
00:22:20.030 --> 00:22:23.140
we should see a whole bunch of empty spots

420
00:22:23.140 --> 00:22:25.190
that then will be filled in

421
00:22:25.190 --> 00:22:27.510
when you go to previous page previous

422
00:22:30.820 --> 00:22:32.340
and they will be updating.

423
00:22:32.340 --> 00:22:36.140
It's just that the Dev tools are again, not very good.

424
00:22:36.140 --> 00:22:38.540
And you have to reopen it to get a

425
00:22:40.210 --> 00:22:41.050
fixed version of it.

426
00:22:41.050 --> 00:22:42.213
Come on, Apollo.

427
00:22:43.309 --> 00:22:44.142
There we go.

428
00:22:44.142 --> 00:22:47.030
You see that it's possible that you get into this issue.

429
00:22:47.030 --> 00:22:49.390
Okay, cool, so the very last thing is

430
00:22:49.390 --> 00:22:51.147
there is one more issue.

431
00:22:51.147 --> 00:22:53.690
And when you go to the last page

432
00:22:56.470 --> 00:22:59.460
and it says cannot access property of all products

433
00:22:59.460 --> 00:23:01.510
data is undefined.

434
00:23:01.510 --> 00:23:02.900
And the reason we're getting that

435
00:23:02.900 --> 00:23:07.160
is because if we take a look at our pagination field,

436
00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:07.993
here we go

437
00:23:09.190 --> 00:23:14.190
we are only ever returning the items when there are four.

438
00:23:18.100 --> 00:23:20.500 line:15% 
And in this case, when you're on the last page

439
00:23:20.500 --> 00:23:22.770 line:15% 
there are not there's not four

440
00:23:22.770 --> 00:23:25.590 line:15% 
because there might only be one item on the last page.

441
00:23:25.590 --> 00:23:26.860
So what we need to do

442
00:23:26.860 --> 00:23:29.530
is before we do this one right here,

443
00:23:29.530 --> 00:23:33.473
we need to say if the items.length and

444
00:23:35.370 --> 00:23:37.060
so if there are items,

445
00:23:37.060 --> 00:23:42.060
but the items.length does not equal the first value.

446
00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:47.123
So how many we requested.

447
00:23:48.110 --> 00:23:53.110
And the page that we're on is equal to the number of pages.

448
00:23:55.490 --> 00:23:57.650
So let's write a comment.

449
00:23:57.650 --> 00:24:01.307
If there are items and

450
00:24:09.510 --> 00:24:14.510
there aren't enough items

451
00:24:14.540 --> 00:24:19.540
to satisfy how many were requested.

452
00:24:23.370 --> 00:24:24.930
So in our case two.

453
00:24:24.930 --> 00:24:28.363
And we are on the last page,

454
00:24:30.580 --> 00:24:34.333
then just send it.

455
00:24:35.650 --> 00:24:38.660
So that covers the thing is you want two per page

456
00:24:38.660 --> 00:24:39.710
but we only have one.

457
00:24:40.810 --> 00:24:43.210
And if that's the case, we're just gonna send it

458
00:24:43.210 --> 00:24:45.780
because we are on the last page.

459
00:24:45.780 --> 00:24:48.860
And there's a possibility that we don't have enough items

460
00:24:48.860 --> 00:24:51.540
to fill the last page entirely.

461
00:24:51.540 --> 00:24:56.513
So if then we simply just return items.

462
00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:05.350
There we go and that's one item.

463
00:25:05.350 --> 00:25:07.500
So that's a very up to

464
00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:09.872
if statement, I probably spent an entire day writing

465
00:25:09.872 --> 00:25:14.653
(laughing) to get one item showing up on the last page.

466
00:25:16.950 --> 00:25:18.350
So that works.

467
00:25:18.350 --> 00:25:19.610
So now the question is

468
00:25:19.610 --> 00:25:22.100
is what happens when we delete an item?

469
00:25:22.100 --> 00:25:23.783
So let's go to,

470
00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:30.160
let's go here, so we got belt, jacket, shoes.

471
00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:33.730
So what happens when I delete this item now?

472
00:25:33.730 --> 00:25:35.940
So delete, go ahead and, okay.

473
00:25:35.940 --> 00:25:39.523
Boom, so what happened there is that

474
00:25:39.523 --> 00:25:41.520
you see how it automatically went

475
00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:43.850
and fetched the next item for the next page.

476
00:25:43.850 --> 00:25:47.600
That's because in our Apollo cache,

477
00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:51.890
all of our items are now under one key which is all products

478
00:25:51.890 --> 00:25:53.550
and they're not under multiple keys

479
00:25:53.550 --> 00:25:56.700
which is page one, page two, page three, page four.

480
00:25:56.700 --> 00:25:58.760
So that's the thing we get into.

481
00:25:58.760 --> 00:26:01.760
There is a couple of little Ed's Casey issues

482
00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:03.580
that I hope will be solved.

483
00:26:03.580 --> 00:26:05.940
And if so, I'll update this video.

484
00:26:05.940 --> 00:26:08.220
But for now, that actually helps out

485
00:26:08.220 --> 00:26:09.950
in almost all of our cases.

486
00:26:09.950 --> 00:26:12.820
So you can see the number of items even has updated itself.

487
00:26:12.820 --> 00:26:15.460
So I know that wasn't very much fun.

488
00:26:15.460 --> 00:26:17.520
That probably took me very many days,

489
00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:20.310
very many phone calls and I apologize for it.

490
00:26:20.310 --> 00:26:24.640
But that is the official word from the Devs at Apollo

491
00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:27.800
as to how you should actually approach something like this.

492
00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:29.890
Let's get into something a little bit more fun

493
00:26:29.890 --> 00:26:31.440
and I'll catch you in that one.
