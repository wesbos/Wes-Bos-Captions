00:00:00.188 --> 00:00:01.460
(air whooshing)

2
00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:02.640
<v Narrator>So real quick review,</v>

3
00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:06.130
we have very basic yes or no are they signed in function,

4
00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:08.770
then we have permission-based functions

5
00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:11.483
that check if somebody has a specific permission

6
00:00:11.483 --> 00:00:13.380
as well as we can add additional

7
00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.780
yes or no functions to that.

8
00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.730
And at the very end of that

9
00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.120
and probably the ones that you'll be using most often

10
00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:21.770
are rule-based functions.

11
00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:24.320
So rule based functions are logical functions

12
00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.280
that can be used for list access,

13
00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:29.960
so are different types that we have products users,

14
00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.020
orders, cart items, all of that stuff

15
00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:34.690
and they allow us to either

16
00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:37.850
return a Boolean yes or no similar to this,

17
00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.530
but also a set of filters which can limit

18
00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:43.440
the number of items that they can update.

19
00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.100
So I'll show you an example that we have here.

20
00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.470
Let's take a look at our product.ts

21
00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:51.070
and you'll see here we have our product and...

22
00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:52.893
let's go through it, create, okay.

23
00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:56.820
Yes. Create is going to be available

24
00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.350
to literally anyone who assigned into the application.

25
00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:01.860
You should be able to create, all right?

26
00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:03.050
Read.

27
00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:05.570
Yeah. Everybody is going to be able to read them

28
00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:07.140
and we're gonna come back to that in a second

29
00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.430
because we actually wanna filter that

30
00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:12.200
just for published products or available products,

31
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.950
but the one I wanna focus on right now

32
00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.750
is actually update and delete.

33
00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:19.690
So who should be able to update and delete a product?

34
00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:22.970
Well, me, the administrator should be able to

35
00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:26.750
and that's why we have canUpdateProducts.

36
00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:31.470
If we take a look at our fields here

37
00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.470
we have a permission called, canManageProducts right here.

38
00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.180
So that person should be able to manage a product,

39
00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:42.100
they should be able to update the text of it,

40
00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:43.420
the price, the things like that,

41
00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.810
but then that person should also be able to delete it.

42
00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.130
But people who create a product can own it,

43
00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.890
should be able to update and delete their own products

44
00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.960
without having an elevated privilege of managing products.

45
00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.370
So now we're in sort of a two step process,

46
00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:02.520
either you have canManagedProduct role

47
00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.400
or you are the owner of the item.

48
00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.560
So what we'll do, is we'll go down here

49
00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.820
and we'll make some rules.

50
00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:13.780
So export const rules is equal to curly bracket

51
00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.860
and let's put a little comment here right now.

52
00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:22.100
Rules can return a Boolean yes or no,

53
00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:27.100
or a filter which limits which products they can access

54
00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.250
they can crud, right?

55
00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.320
Depends on whether we put it into the list of create,

56
00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.000
read, update or delete right here.

57
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.930
So we'll go.

58
00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.269
First thing is, is we wanna make one called

59
00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:42.769
canManageProducts,

60
00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:47.130
and again, that's going to take in the session.

61
00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.720
We'll destructure it with curly brackets there.

62
00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:54.530
So we'll first gonna check is, do they have the permission

63
00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:56.763
of canManageProducts?

64
00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.160
And so this going to be a little bit confusing

65
00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:01.910
because a rule is a combination

66
00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:04.280
and then this is just a straight permission.

67
00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.320
If you wanted to name it something different you can,

68
00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:10.300
but I in my head like the think of permissions

69
00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:15.130
as singular permissions and rules as multiples of them

70
00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:17.170
then second thing we're gonna check is

71
00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:22.030
if not, do they own this item?

72
00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:24.180
So once here we'll say,

73
00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.300
if and we'll use our permission,

74
00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:29.580
permissions.canManageProducts

75
00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:36.700
and you can pass it our session,

76
00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:41.080
so if that returns true, then we return true here.

77
00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:42.400
Otherwise do they own it?

78
00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.320
We will return and this is gonna be returning a wear filter

79
00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:49.160
that we've been using in the graph QL API.

80
00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:53.870
So we say, return where the user ID

81
00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:00.050
is equal to these session.item ID

82
00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:02.080
and it's give me a red underline

83
00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:04.000
'cause I did not type this.

84
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.970
So that's listAccessArgs, there we go.

85
00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:10.760
Now what this will do is again, I'll say it one more time.

86
00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:12.160
You're probably getting sick of me.

87
00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.170
Do they have this permission?

88
00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:16.280
If so they're probably an admin

89
00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:18.640
or somebody that has given them permission

90
00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:21.090
to do so then yes, they can access that.

91
00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:23.670
Otherwise, do they own this item?

92
00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:25.860
So we return the wear filter here

93
00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:28.663
and if this where filter does not find anything,

94
00:04:30.418 --> 00:04:32.400
it will return a false value

95
00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:35.100
and we will not be able to do things.

96
00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:38.100
So we'll go back to our product.ts

97
00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:40.660
and go to update and delete here,

98
00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:45.660
and we'll go ahead and say, rules.canManageProducts

99
00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:53.360
and those are the rules that we have there.

100
00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:57.290
Now we can restart our backend here

101
00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:01.343
and I'm gonna go to the products,

102
00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:08.740
Oh, little error here.

103
00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:11.610
Rules is not, Oh, I forgot to import it.

104
00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:12.933
Silly Wes.

105
00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:18.513
So import rules from access,

106
00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:22.520
and that will give it a start.

107
00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:24.330
So the first thing that we can try

108
00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:27.520
and this can be done via the app or via the Keystone UI

109
00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:30.580
is if you try to edit one of these things,

110
00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:34.590
so if I put an X on the end and save changes,

111
00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:38.070
then of course the other thing we need to do is that,

112
00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:39.240
if somebody owns the item

113
00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:40.630
they should be able to edit it as well.

114
00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:43.010
So we need to modify our product

115
00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:46.920
and our user just really quickly because we do not,

116
00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:49.200
if we take a look at our user.ts

117
00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:50.700
we do not have a relationship

118
00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:52.540
between the products and the user right now.

119
00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:54.230
We've just been assuming that the administrator

120
00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:55.530
can take care of all of it.

121
00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:57.520
So we have to modify a little,

122
00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:00.010
let's start in our product.ts here

123
00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:04.030
and we'll add a new field at the bottom, right under price.

124
00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:05.747
We'll call it user,

125
00:06:05.747 --> 00:06:08.393
and that is going to be a relationship.

126
00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:13.570
The reference is going to be a user.products

127
00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:18.570
with an S the default value of when a product is created,

128
00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:21.500
this is gonna be the important part is that

129
00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:26.500
we have to programmatically do it based on the user session.

130
00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:29.000
So what we'll do is we'll take the default value

131
00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:33.090
and do a little arrow function right here,

132
00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:36.860
we can destructure the context

133
00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:43.800
and we'll return an object that says

134
00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:48.800
connect the ID with the context.session.item ID.

135
00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:58.770
So what that does here is when a product is created,

136
00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:01.700
the reason why we didn't do this previously is 'cause

137
00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:04.220
we didn't lock down the ability to create a product

138
00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:07.560
just unless you were assigned in until the last video.

139
00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:10.463
But now what we're doing is when a product is created,

140
00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:14.550
make a relationship to user.products

141
00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:17.150
and then the default value is going to be

142
00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:21.420
the currently signed in user, which is exactly what we want

143
00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:26.420
and we return an object with a connect property on it

144
00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:28.370
which connects to that the idea

145
00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:29.520
of the currently signed in user.

146
00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:34.430
Then we'll flip over to the user and do the opposite.

147
00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:36.090
So we'll go to the user, right?

148
00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:38.760
Under role, we'll say products,

149
00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:43.760
and that is a relationship or the ref is going to be

150
00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:49.620
user. Oh, no product.user,

151
00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:51.600
many is going to be true

152
00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:53.480
'cause a user can have many products

153
00:07:54.630 --> 00:07:56.920
and I believe that is it.

154
00:07:56.920 --> 00:08:01.500
So let's go and kill the backend started up again.

155
00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:04.150
And now you see there is a user,

156
00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:07.170
we can assign that one to me,

157
00:08:07.170 --> 00:08:09.110
save changes, good,

158
00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:11.440
and then I'm gonna go to the products

159
00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:14.070
and let's take a look at our users real quick.

160
00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:18.640
Let's assign one of these products to test

161
00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:21.290
that is tests@example.com

162
00:08:21.290 --> 00:08:23.880
and you can actually show what their products are

163
00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:24.713
right from here.

164
00:08:24.713 --> 00:08:26.150
That's the beauty of two-way relationship.

165
00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:31.060
So they own, let's say ultra boost

166
00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:34.700
and they also own the

167
00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:37.110
black hole.

168
00:08:37.110 --> 00:08:38.620
Go ahead and save it.

169
00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:43.620
Okay. So now if I sign in as test@example.com,

170
00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:45.390
so I'll go to a local host 3000,

171
00:08:45.390 --> 00:08:46.683
try this to sign in,

172
00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:50.030
then go to products

173
00:08:51.450 --> 00:08:53.470
and what was the product?

174
00:08:53.470 --> 00:08:56.700
Let's try and edit the black hole first.

175
00:08:56.700 --> 00:09:00.920
So go do black hole,

176
00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:04.100
put an X on it, save, good.

177
00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:07.170
And then let's try to edit our product that they do not own,

178
00:09:07.170 --> 00:09:10.080
let's see Eddie Hondo put an X on the end, save product.

179
00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:10.913
Here we go.

180
00:09:10.913 --> 00:09:12.910
Failed update, you do not have access to this resource.

181
00:09:12.910 --> 00:09:17.840
So the user still is able to read the resource from here

182
00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:20.210
and you can also get a little bit more nitty gritty

183
00:09:20.210 --> 00:09:23.740
and you could also hide it from the Keystone admin UI

184
00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:26.800
or you could hide the entire backend UI

185
00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:29.860
just unless you had a specific permission

186
00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:31.310
called KenSci backend

187
00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:36.190
but that now gives us the ability to update items

188
00:09:36.190 --> 00:09:39.510
we do own or update all the items

189
00:09:39.510 --> 00:09:42.430
if you are a someone who has the permission.

190
00:09:42.430 --> 00:09:44.100
So let's try once more.

191
00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:46.120
Let's go back to that user

192
00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:49.250
and let's go here

193
00:09:49.250 --> 00:09:50.860
and let's select from the role.

194
00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:53.520
Let's make them an admin and go here

195
00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:54.970
and then try save it again

196
00:09:54.970 --> 00:09:56.950
and it does save successfully.

197
00:09:56.950 --> 00:09:59.110
I'm gonna take that admin role off,

198
00:09:59.110 --> 00:10:02.130
save changes and I wouldn't be able to do it again.

199
00:10:02.130 --> 00:10:03.710
Now, last thing we wanna do is

200
00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:05.870
if you go to products and you edit one of your products,

201
00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:08.920
you see we have this status right here,

202
00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:10.790
draft available or unavailable.

203
00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:13.620
So right now we're not filtering by any of that.

204
00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:16.480
And even when we're doing our queries,

205
00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:19.080
I told you don't worry about it just yet.

206
00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:20.240
But now what we can do

207
00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:23.250
is we can actually put that filter

208
00:10:23.250 --> 00:10:25.130
directly into the access control.

209
00:10:25.130 --> 00:10:30.090
So people who have access to read all the products

210
00:10:30.090 --> 00:10:31.440
will be able to see them all,

211
00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:33.670
but people who only have access

212
00:10:33.670 --> 00:10:35.080
or who don't have access to that

213
00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:37.730
will only see products that are available.

214
00:10:37.730 --> 00:10:41.070
So let's go back into our access.ts here

215
00:10:41.070 --> 00:10:42.870
and we'll go down here,

216
00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:45.173
we'll make a new one called canReadProducts

217
00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:49.040
and we'll destructure the session

218
00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:54.930
and return listAccessArgs

219
00:10:58.080 --> 00:10:59.930
and then from that, we'll say

220
00:10:59.930 --> 00:11:03.930
if the permissions got canManageProducts

221
00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:08.683
past the session,

222
00:11:10.270 --> 00:11:15.270
then it'll return true which is they can read everything.

223
00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:27.060
Otherwise they should only see available products

224
00:11:28.420 --> 00:11:31.913
and I'll say based on the status field.

225
00:11:32.940 --> 00:11:33.930
And then what we'll do from there,

226
00:11:33.930 --> 00:11:36.100
is we'll just return an object

227
00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:38.370
where the status is available

228
00:11:38.370 --> 00:11:40.650
and what that will do is that will bind

229
00:11:40.650 --> 00:11:44.220
as a wear clause in the graph, QL API

230
00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:46.500
and only show you products that have available.

231
00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:49.450
So now watch, like I haven't restarted just yet,

232
00:11:49.450 --> 00:11:53.630
but if I go to products or I go to the front end,

233
00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:55.030
I see them all.

234
00:11:55.030 --> 00:11:58.230
But now when I restart the sucker,

235
00:11:58.230 --> 00:12:02.823
I should only see products that have a status of available.

236
00:12:06.090 --> 00:12:08.210
So I'm seeing 12 products.

237
00:12:08.210 --> 00:12:12.913
Now, if I change this one to draft and save and refresh,

238
00:12:16.270 --> 00:12:17.970
I still see 12 product.

239
00:12:17.970 --> 00:12:20.210
It didn't work because I forgot I wrote the function

240
00:12:20.210 --> 00:12:22.710
but it didn't implement it. (laughs)

241
00:12:22.710 --> 00:12:24.750
So we had to go back to our product

242
00:12:24.750 --> 00:12:29.740
and we'll go back up to read,

243
00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:31.230
right now we're saying, you can read it

244
00:12:31.230 --> 00:12:33.780
if you're signed in, but in our case

245
00:12:33.780 --> 00:12:37.410
we wanna show that to everybody, but only available ones.

246
00:12:37.410 --> 00:12:40.734
So we'll change that to rules., what do we call it?

247
00:12:40.734 --> 00:12:42.067
CanReadProducts.

248
00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:47.423
Now, so restart it,

249
00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:50.350
and whenever somebody tries to read it,

250
00:12:50.350 --> 00:12:52.820
it's going to say, "All right, well, hold on.

251
00:12:52.820 --> 00:12:55.770
Do you have the managed product session?

252
00:12:55.770 --> 00:12:57.040
Otherwise, if that's true

253
00:12:57.040 --> 00:12:59.650
then return true and you can read everything.

254
00:12:59.650 --> 00:13:02.440
Otherwise, we're gonna give you a subset of the products

255
00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:05.960
only ones that have a status of available."

256
00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:08.800
And here we go look, 11 products here,

257
00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:11.270
and there should be 12 here.

258
00:13:11.270 --> 00:13:12.300
There we go, 12 there.

259
00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:15.170
So now if I maybe edit a couple more

260
00:13:16.340 --> 00:13:19.037
and turn them over to draft,

261
00:13:19.037 --> 00:13:21.787
(mouse clicking)

262
00:13:31.650 --> 00:13:33.140
and I refresh this

263
00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.690
I only see a subset versus admin sees a whole bunch.

264
00:13:37.690 --> 00:13:41.240
So that is pretty cool that when I saw that,

265
00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:42.390
I was like, "Oh, that's amazing."

266
00:13:42.390 --> 00:13:46.640
Like you took the filtering of what the users should see

267
00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:48.880
and you didn't do it at a query level.

268
00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:52.000
You did it at even higher level, which is an access level.

269
00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.130
So those are rule-based functions.

270
00:13:55.130 --> 00:13:56.760
Now we have a bit of work ahead of us

271
00:13:56.760 --> 00:13:57.920
is where we need to go through

272
00:13:57.920 --> 00:14:01.810
every single one of these products right here

273
00:14:01.810 --> 00:14:04.880
and go through the create, read, update, delete,

274
00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:06.060
and think about whether

275
00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:08.160
people should be able to do things or not.
