1
00:00:00.173 --> 00:00:01.687
(Whoosh)

2
00:00:01.687 --> 00:00:05.060
<v ->(claps) Alright, now we got to make the custom mutation</v>

3
00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:07.260
to actually go ahead and charge the card.

4
00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:11.520
So, real quick how it works again is, we get the token

5
00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:14.410
on the client side and basically all we're doing there

6
00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:16.960
is sending credit card information.

7
00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.530
And that just basically goes to stripe and says

8
00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:21.600
this is a real credit card.

9
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.910
I think it's called pre-authorization.

10
00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.100
And then we take that token to our back end

11
00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.350
and we're allowed to go ahead

12
00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:32.210
and push the charge through as well as provide information

13
00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:35.700
about the total amount for that.

14
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.280
So we need to go into our mutations folder here

15
00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.900
and go to index.ts.

16
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:46.110
And we're going to add a new mutation here.

17
00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.210
So the mutation here is going to be called the checkout.

18
00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.810
So checkout, that takes in a token from the client side

19
00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:57.880
and that is a type of string that is required,

20
00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:01.250
and returned from that will be an order.

21
00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.010
Then we'll go down to the resolvers here

22
00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:06.693
and we'll make a new mutation resolver, called checkout.

23
00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.260
And we have to then go ahead and make that really quickly.

24
00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:16.250
So, I'm just gonna open my add to cart mutation here.

25
00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.120
And I'm going to just save a copy of it

26
00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.440
and we'll call it checkout.ts.

27
00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.673
Again, this is in our mutations folder.

28
00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:30.610
Then, we can go ahead and start to delete a couple of things

29
00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:32.810
that we need here.

30
00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:37.200
Basically, we can take out all of the code from within it,

31
00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.920
I really just wanted this function signature right here,

32
00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.110
'cause it's kind of hard to type.

33
00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.313
So, delete everything inside the body of that.

34
00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:51.200
And this is going to return a promise which returns

35
00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.533
an order, create input.

36
00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:02.853
And then we'll rename this to checkout.

37
00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:07.210
Okay, I think we're in good shape.

38
00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:12.210
You can remove the, any additional data

39
00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:14.563
that you have up here.

40
00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.420
And we'll go back to our index and make sure we import

41
00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.353
that checkout function.

42
00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.423
I'll just duplicate this and say checkout.

43
00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.150
Okay, still giving me heck here,

44
00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.857
unsafe assignment of an any value.

45
00:02:33.857 --> 00:02:35.270
What!

46
00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:38.020
(mouse clicking)

47
00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:43.493
Oh, it's because we didn't export it properly.

48
00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.680
It always knows, it always knows.

49
00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.300
We also need to modify this,

50
00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:54.000
this is no longer a product ID but we're taking in a token.

51
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.680
Again, this second argument to the function

52
00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.310
is gonna be arguments, we're de-structuring

53
00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.720
the arguments.token, and then you have to provide

54
00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.340
an object type here.

55
00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:05.910
Basically we're saying give me an object

56
00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:07.650
that has a token and a string.

57
00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.160
Additionally, you could also just say like,

58
00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.400
interface arguments.

59
00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.530
And then in there you could say we have a token,

60
00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:19.783
which is a type of string.

61
00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:23.460
And then we can go down here and just replace that.

62
00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:27.551
That might be a little bit easier to read.

63
00:03:27.551 --> 00:03:31.060
Just to clarify, I know that this gets a little bit hairy

64
00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.240
if you're not into TypeScript a whole lot.

65
00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:36.280
Okay, so, we've got everything working.

66
00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:40.420
If we kill our process and started again, my question is,

67
00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:45.420
do we now see the checkout function showing up

68
00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.220
in our GraphQL Playground?

69
00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:48.700
So I'm just gonna refresh this

70
00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:50.200
and wait for Keystone to load.

71
00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:57.640
And we'll take a look at our docks here

72
00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:59.746
and look for checkout.

73
00:03:59.746 --> 00:04:00.579
There we go.

74
00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:04.540
Mutation checkout, takes in a token, returns an order,

75
00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:07.940
and it knows exactly all the information

76
00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:09.580
that is going to return to us.

77
00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:10.413
Awesome.

78
00:04:10.413 --> 00:04:12.520
So now the sort of the hard work that we have

79
00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:17.520
to do right now is inside of this checkout function,

80
00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:21.760
we need to do a whole bunch of work.

81
00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:23.520
So first thing we have to do

82
00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.583
is make sure they are signed in.

83
00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:29.710
Then the second thing we want to do

84
00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:32.933
is calculate the total price.

85
00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:38.440
And how that's gonna work is that in step number one,

86
00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:40.850
we're gonna query the current user.

87
00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:42.830
And if there's not a user, we'll throw an error

88
00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:45.670
and if there is a user, we will also have to query

89
00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:48.520
the entire cart for that user which is great.

90
00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:51.640
So that will allow us to calculate

91
00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:53.800
the total price of their cart.

92
00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:57.760
Third thing we want to do is create the payment

93
00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:00.470
with the stripe library.

94
00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:02.440
So we also have to import the stripe library

95
00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:05.633
into our back end and go ahead and charge that.

96
00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:08.900
Then the fourth thing we'll do

97
00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:13.900
is convert the cart items to order items, remember,

98
00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:18.300
because we can't leave them as just regular products.

99
00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:21.610
And then finally, the fifth thing we wanna do

100
00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:25.170
is create the order and return it.

101
00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:27.380
So we're gonna be saving it in the database.

102
00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:29.400
So, first things first, make sure they're signed in.

103
00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:32.180
So basically here, we'll get their user Id

104
00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:37.180
and we'll say const user Id =

105
00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:42.710
context.session.item Id,

106
00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:47.710
I'll say if there is no user ID, then we can throw, whoa!

107
00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:54.980
Throw a new error, that says, "Sorry you must be signed in

108
00:05:55.627 --> 00:05:57.610
"to create an order."

109
00:05:57.610 --> 00:05:59.650
Alright, that's the first thing.

110
00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:01.940
Next, calculate the total price for their order.

111
00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:03.530
I guess, like we need a step.

112
00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:05.030
This is the problem with numbering my steps.

113
00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:08.913
Sometimes (laughs), step 1.5 is query the current user.

114
00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:11.980
So the way that we'll do that

115
00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:15.630
is we'll say const user = await,

116
00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:20.630
we'll take the context.lists.user.find one.

117
00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:24.200
And we are going to find one

118
00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:29.153
where the id is equal to the user Id.

119
00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:33.100
And then the resolve fields is going

120
00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:37.570
to be very much just a GraphQL thing here.

121
00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:39.490
So we'll do back ticks.

122
00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:41.460
We want, here we'll do it on its own line.

123
00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:45.620
Id, name, email and cart.

124
00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:47.760
Let's see where we're at with that so far.

125
00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:52.760
So if I console.log the user and we restart our process,

126
00:06:56.120 --> 00:07:00.343
if I run this mutation checkout with a token,

127
00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:03.500
are we going to get the currently logged

128
00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:06.053
in users entire cart from there.

129
00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:11.930
So say mutation is checkout the token,

130
00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:14.220
you know that you can pass any token you want right now,

131
00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:15.730
it's ABC 123.

132
00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:20.313
And then returned from that we want the Id of the user.

133
00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:25.510
Let's just get the Id of the actual order,

134
00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:27.840
'cause it's not actually gonna return anything just yet.

135
00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:31.180
So, let's make sure that it's all running good.

136
00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:35.143
Go ahead and clear out your DevTools, run it, boom!

137
00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:38.950
We've got a bit of an error.

138
00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:41.900
Cannot read property find one of undefined.

139
00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:44.250
Oh, you know what I did is,

140
00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:46.900
this needs to be a capital U, User,

141
00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:48.450
so I gotta go through the whole song and dance,

142
00:07:48.450 --> 00:07:50.300
I'll speed it up, okay, gonna run it.

143
00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:53.100
Boom!

144
00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:55.630
And good, we're getting our cart items show up here.

145
00:07:55.630 --> 00:07:57.120
They're empty, because we have to write

146
00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:59.660
a little bit more GraphQL here.

147
00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:01.190
And again, we're getting this issue where this

148
00:08:01.190 --> 00:08:03.100
is obviously just a string, but we want it

149
00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:05.980
to look like a GraphQL once we highlight it.

150
00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:07.390
So we can do a little trick here,

151
00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:12.307
we say const graphql = string.raw,

152
00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:16.270
oh, that should be a capital S, that's the built in string.

153
00:08:17.210 --> 00:08:20.300
And then we can go ahead and tag this as graphql.

154
00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:21.460
There we go.

155
00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:24.860
Now inside the cart, we want a whole bunch of stuff

156
00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:25.763
about their cart.

157
00:08:26.670 --> 00:08:30.363
At the id of the cart, you want the quantity,

158
00:08:31.710 --> 00:08:35.360
you want the product that's associated with that cart item,

159
00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:38.603
you want the name, the price, the description,

160
00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:45.050
the id, the photo inside of that is an image.

161
00:08:45.050 --> 00:08:49.230
And then you also need the id of both of those

162
00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:55.320
and the public Url Transformed.

163
00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:58.830
So now if I log that out again,

164
00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:02.060
after I restart it, we should see a huge dump of it.

165
00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:04.050
I'm gonna use console.dir here,

166
00:09:04.050 --> 00:09:06.600
and the reason I do that is because you can pass it

167
00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:10.480
a depth of null and it won't truncate any objects

168
00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:13.780
that you're logging in your terminal there.

169
00:09:13.780 --> 00:09:16.130
So go ahead and run this, boom!

170
00:09:16.130 --> 00:09:18.770
Look at this, we've got all the different items

171
00:09:18.770 --> 00:09:19.920
that are in our cart.

172
00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:21.870
One thing that I've intentionally done here

173
00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:25.510
is that you can see there are five items in my cart.

174
00:09:25.510 --> 00:09:28.330
But these last two don't have a product associated

175
00:09:28.330 --> 00:09:29.163
with them.

176
00:09:29.163 --> 00:09:31.430
So what I did, is I went ahead

177
00:09:31.430 --> 00:09:32.890
and added something to my cart

178
00:09:32.890 --> 00:09:34.700
and then I deleted the product.

179
00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:37.770
So now we're in a situation where we have a cart item

180
00:09:37.770 --> 00:09:40.190
but the product that the cart item references

181
00:09:40.190 --> 00:09:42.410
is no longer there, it is deleted,

182
00:09:42.410 --> 00:09:44.210
it's no longer in the database.

183
00:09:44.210 --> 00:09:47.350
So what we have to do is we're to filter these things out.

184
00:09:47.350 --> 00:09:48.830
We've already taken care of that

185
00:09:48.830 --> 00:09:52.610
in our cart before we go ahead and display it

186
00:09:52.610 --> 00:09:54.000
but we have to do it here as well,

187
00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.030
where we gotta filter them out before we go ahead

188
00:09:57.030 --> 00:09:58.180
and calculate the total.

189
00:09:58.180 --> 00:10:00.570
So, here we'll do it, so I say const

190
00:10:00.570 --> 00:10:05.233
cart items = user.cart.filter.

191
00:10:06.340 --> 00:10:10.030
Then we'll take the cart item and we'll return

192
00:10:10.030 --> 00:10:12.770
cart item.product.

193
00:10:12.770 --> 00:10:16.350
And if that returns an object, it will be true.

194
00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:19.000
And if it returns, null, it will be false

195
00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:20.760
and it will filter that item out.

196
00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:23.470
And that should give us just the actual cart items

197
00:10:23.470 --> 00:10:24.430
that we want.

198
00:10:24.430 --> 00:10:28.070
So, in order to calculate the total price

199
00:10:28.070 --> 00:10:31.460
of what is in our order, we will use reduce.

200
00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:36.460
So const amount = cart items.reduce.

201
00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:41.610
And we'll do a proper, you could probably get away

202
00:10:41.610 --> 00:10:42.700
with a little arrow function here

203
00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:44.660
but I'm gonna show you how to type this.

204
00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:48.130
So we have a tally, which means we're going to start off

205
00:10:48.130 --> 00:10:49.420
with a zero here.

206
00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:52.480
And that tally has to be typed as a number.

207
00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:55.280
And then we also have each individual item in reduce,

208
00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:56.380
that's the second argument.

209
00:10:56.380 --> 00:10:57.630
So we'll say cart item.

210
00:10:57.630 --> 00:11:02.020
And the type of that is, cart item,

211
00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:05.143
I believe it's create input.

212
00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:12.380
Then from that, we can return the tally + cart item.,

213
00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:15.180
and you see this is why we type it

214
00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:17.620
'cause we get these nice auto-completions.

215
00:11:17.620 --> 00:11:22.043
We wanna take the quantity times cart item.product.,

216
00:11:25.130 --> 00:11:27.483
what is, it's price, lives on there.

217
00:11:29.130 --> 00:11:30.460
All right, now we have the amount.

218
00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:33.650
you can go ahead and console.log that amount

219
00:11:33.650 --> 00:11:35.360
and just make sure everything is working

220
00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:38.083
before we get into the more advanced stripe stuff.

221
00:11:39.370 --> 00:11:42.120
Go ahead and run this, boom!

222
00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:43.290
Oh, it wasn't ready yet.

223
00:11:43.290 --> 00:11:44.880
There we go, run it again,

224
00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:49.880
and you see I get 30,482 for the cart items.

225
00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:52.140
Okay, good.

226
00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:54.970
Next thing is create the payment with the stripe library.

227
00:11:54.970 --> 00:11:57.070
Okay, so now we need to configure stripe

228
00:11:57.070 --> 00:11:58.770
to work on our server side.

229
00:11:58.770 --> 00:12:02.180
And we're going to need a secret key for that to work.

230
00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:05.850
So go back to your stripe, go to API keys,

231
00:12:05.850 --> 00:12:09.720
reveal where you have your secret key and click on reveal.

232
00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:10.930
Go ahead and copy that.

233
00:12:10.930 --> 00:12:13.860
Again, treat this like a password.

234
00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:16.683
Publishable key, that's fine, that goes in the browser.

235
00:12:17.540 --> 00:12:22.250
Secret keys always need to be treated as passwords

236
00:12:22.250 --> 00:12:25.780
and they should never be shown to your users

237
00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:28.380
or your browser or anything like that.

238
00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:31.730
So what we wanna do is go to our .env

239
00:12:31.730 --> 00:12:35.840
and we will say stripe, oh, we already got it right here.

240
00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:36.680
Stripe secret.

241
00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:39.323
So we will replace that, right here, boom!

242
00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:45.590
And we need to make a stripe.ts file.

243
00:12:45.590 --> 00:12:48.233
So go to your lib, make a new file,

244
00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:50.303
got stripe.ts.

245
00:12:52.517 --> 00:12:55.873
(mouse clicking)

246
00:12:55.873 --> 00:12:59.373
And in there, we're going to import stripe

247
00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:04.983
from the stripe library.

248
00:13:07.150 --> 00:13:12.150
Then we will say const stripe config = new stripe.

249
00:13:16.650 --> 00:13:18.910
And then we pass it, our secret key.

250
00:13:18.910 --> 00:13:22.500
So process.env.stripe_secret,

251
00:13:23.874 --> 00:13:27.520
and then we say or an empty string

252
00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:31.210
and that will just keep our TypeScript happy.

253
00:13:31.210 --> 00:13:34.660
The other argument that you need if we hover over

254
00:13:34.660 --> 00:13:37.680
this right now, it says expected two arguments

255
00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:41.880
but got one, an argument, ooh, an argument for config

256
00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:43.010
was not provided.

257
00:13:43.010 --> 00:13:48.010
Okay, so, the next one is a config object.

258
00:13:48.130 --> 00:13:52.250
And we need to have an API version

259
00:13:52.250 --> 00:13:56.250
because it's kind of cool, stripes API changes all the time

260
00:13:56.250 --> 00:13:58.870
but they will still run the old code

261
00:13:58.870 --> 00:14:02.810
for you until you explicitly upgrade the API version.

262
00:14:02.810 --> 00:14:04.777
And it says right here 2020, 08, 27.

263
00:14:08.270 --> 00:14:10.820
I guess that's the most recent version.

264
00:14:10.820 --> 00:14:13.863
So I'm not sure if I can copy that.

265
00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:17.533
I can, to copy you just click it.

266
00:14:18.580 --> 00:14:21.590
Actually, maybe it's an enum let's try.

267
00:14:21.590 --> 00:14:24.743
API version (laughs), look, it just,

268
00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:28.710
possible options are, there's only one right now,

269
00:14:28.710 --> 00:14:31.600
'cause they just introduced this feature into the library.

270
00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:33.600
But bam, it just auto-completes it for you.

271
00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:36.520
Again, that's another huge benefit to TypeScript.

272
00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:40.977
Then we can go ahead and export default stripe config.

273
00:14:43.750 --> 00:14:46.520
And that is our whole stripe library.

274
00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:48.920
I almost will always do this in my apps.

275
00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:50.920
I just put stripe into its own file,

276
00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:53.120
make the config and then export it.

277
00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:55.780
And that way you can import this config anywhere you want,

278
00:14:55.780 --> 00:14:59.560
you don't have to repass it, the secret and the API version,

279
00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:00.583
all that stuff.

280
00:15:01.740 --> 00:15:03.533
All right, so we've got that.

281
00:15:04.390 --> 00:15:07.903
Let's go back into our checkout here.

282
00:15:09.180 --> 00:15:13.750
And we're gonna go ahead and use that stripe config.

283
00:15:13.750 --> 00:15:16.210
So, create the payment with stripe.

284
00:15:16.210 --> 00:15:18.440
Wait, maybe we should call it create the charge,

285
00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:20.630
that's that's the word that stripe uses.

286
00:15:20.630 --> 00:15:25.630
So say const charge = await stripe., or stripe config.

287
00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:32.693
And we have to import that from our stripe.js.

288
00:15:35.310 --> 00:15:37.033
There we go, from lib stripe,

289
00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:43.083
and we say .payment intents.create.

290
00:15:44.630 --> 00:15:46.840
And we pass an object to that.

291
00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:49.750
So the amount will be our amount variable.

292
00:15:49.750 --> 00:15:51.530
So you could pass at anything,

293
00:15:51.530 --> 00:15:53.580
stripe deals in cents as well,

294
00:15:53.580 --> 00:15:55.300
so you don't have to convert that to dollars

295
00:15:55.300 --> 00:15:58.340
or anything like that, you have to pass a currency

296
00:15:58.340 --> 00:16:02.600
which is USD, confirm it's true.

297
00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:06.730
The confirm that we have there is to attempt

298
00:16:06.730 --> 00:16:08.693
to immediately confirm it.

299
00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:13.463
Previously you've had to create a payment intent,

300
00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:16.440
wait for that to come back and then you have

301
00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:19.520
to go back to stripe and do confirm.

302
00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:20.810
But like in most cases

303
00:16:20.810 --> 00:16:23.460
you just wanna charge the card immediately.

304
00:16:23.460 --> 00:16:26.840
So by typing confirm true, you'll be able

305
00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:29.370
to do that all in one good step.

306
00:16:29.370 --> 00:16:31.440
And then the payment method is going to be

307
00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:35.320
the token that got sent in from our browser.

308
00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:40.270
So that value gets passed into this resolver right here.

309
00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:45.460
So you just pass it like there, token.

310
00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:48.690
And that's why we called create payment method

311
00:16:48.690 --> 00:16:51.180
on the on the front end, because then stripe knows

312
00:16:51.180 --> 00:16:53.520
how to actually charge that card.

313
00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:55.120
Alright, so that's that.

314
00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:57.770
What we'll do is we'll put a catch on the end there,

315
00:16:57.770 --> 00:17:00.600
'cause this is really important that we handle these errors.

316
00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:03.413
And in here, we can just console.log.

317
00:17:04.950 --> 00:17:07.923
error, but then we should actually throw an error,

318
00:17:10.030 --> 00:17:15.030
we'll say, oops, err.message, just in case anything happens

319
00:17:15.470 --> 00:17:18.040
from the back end.

320
00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:21.600
So we got this charge up and running.

321
00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:24.760
Now it is worth stopping there

322
00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:28.020
and trying to get this working with our client side

323
00:17:28.020 --> 00:17:29.680
'cause we wrote a whole bunch of code,

324
00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:31.220
we have to convert the cart items

325
00:17:31.220 --> 00:17:33.080
and create the order, we'll do that in a bit

326
00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:36.110
but being able to send the token

327
00:17:36.110 --> 00:17:38.760
from the front end to the back end and make a charge.

328
00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:41.160
so it shows up in our payments here

329
00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:42.480
is going to be a big step.

330
00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:43.980
So, let's get that working now

331
00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:46.280
and I'll catch you in the next video for that.
