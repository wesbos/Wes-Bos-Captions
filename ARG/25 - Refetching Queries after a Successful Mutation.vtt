00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:01.620
(whooshing sound)

2
00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:02.670
<v Instructor>If you go to your homepage</v>

3
00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:03.950
and scroll all the way to the bottom,

4
00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:06.180
you'll see these are the two items that I just created

5
00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.300
while recording this video.

6
00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:10.110
And let's go ahead and add another one.

7
00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.330
So, I'm gonna upload, let's do the Hondo

8
00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:18.320
and we'll call it Hondo added now

9
00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:20.440
and I'm gonna submit it.

10
00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:23.250
Boom, okay, now if I go back to the homepage page,

11
00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.560
scroll to the bottom, it's not there, right?

12
00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.960
If I refresh the page,

13
00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.020
oh, there it is.

14
00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:32.562
Why, why, why, why is that happening?

15
00:00:32.562 --> 00:00:36.830
And the reason is because we visited the homepage

16
00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:40.560
then we went to the sell page and then we went back,

17
00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.150
and since we had already been on this page,

18
00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:46.820
it said, ah, I remember this page,

19
00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:48.620
you wanted a list of products.

20
00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.700
I luckily cashed them for you

21
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.860
and I'll just rerender that thing for you

22
00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.450
and I don't have to go all the way back to the network

23
00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:57.730
and back in order to show it.

24
00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:01.530
So, with Apollo, you have a couple options here

25
00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.850
in order to update these queries

26
00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:09.590
where you need them to have fresh data in them.

27
00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:11.360
So, two options are,

28
00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.480
is you could just modify the cash directly,

29
00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:18.290
meaning that if I go to my Apollo here and I go to my cash,

30
00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.040
you see that we have this all products query.

31
00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:26.040
What we could do is when we get this item returned to us

32
00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:28.280
from the mutation,

33
00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.560
we could query all the fields that we need,

34
00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.870
the price, the photo, the description,

35
00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:34.580
and the title and the ID.

36
00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:36.880
We could query all of those right here,

37
00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.800
and then we could just manually inject it into the cash,

38
00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.280
and then it would just automatically update itself

39
00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.650
and we wouldn't have to go back to the network

40
00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:46.840
and it would update it.

41
00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:47.820
And that's great,

42
00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.430
because if you've ever been on a website

43
00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.250
and let's say Twitter,

44
00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.370
Twitter is a really good example.

45
00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:57.460
And you write a tweet and you submit the tweet,

46
00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.850
you immediately see that tweet in the UI

47
00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:03.973
even though it might take a second

48
00:02:03.973 --> 00:02:07.060
to actually go to Twitter servers and come back.

49
00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.610
And then that's what's called an optimistic update

50
00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:11.560
meaning that we assume it's gonna work,

51
00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.440
so we're just gonna visually show you

52
00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.170
that it worked for you and then everyone who's following you

53
00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.090
will see it on their next network refresh.

54
00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.270
The other way to do it is you can just tell Apollo

55
00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:25.610
behind the scenes, hey you know this query

56
00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.460
where you fetched all the products?

57
00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:30.563
Can you just go to the server and refresh that thing again?

58
00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:32.930
That would be super helpful.

59
00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.270
So, I'm gonna show you how to do both in this course,

60
00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:38.040
right now what we'll do is we'll do the network one

61
00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.740
where it's much easier

62
00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:41.970
just to go to the network and refresh it.

63
00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.570
In most cases, there's absolutely no problem in doing that.

64
00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:47.970
So, what we'll do here

65
00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:52.830
is we will go down to this mutation here,

66
00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.723
and you see where we have variables with our inputs,

67
00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:03.080
we can also specify this thing called refetch queries

68
00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.720
and that will be an array of queries

69
00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.680
that it needs to go off and refetch.

70
00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.800
And if we go to our products here,

71
00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.944
you see we have this all products query right here,

72
00:03:13.944 --> 00:03:17.206
we'll just tell it, hey, we already have this query here,

73
00:03:17.206 --> 00:03:21.760
can you please just go ahead and refetch it, refresh it

74
00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.500
for the user behind the scenes?

75
00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.099
So, we can go and we have to first export this

76
00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:29.120
from this file, because now this query is needed

77
00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:32.170
in some other places.

78
00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:35.540
So, let's go to the bottom here, we'll just say export.

79
00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:38.740
Actually, I think we can do it right where we define it,

80
00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:39.573
let's try that.

81
00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:41.900
Export, there we go,

82
00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:43.900
just put an export in front of it.

83
00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.633
Then we'll take the name of it, all products query.

84
00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:49.780
We'll say refetch queries,

85
00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:52.660
each query is gonna be an object

86
00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:57.230
where the query is all products query.

87
00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:58.540
Now, that's not gonna work,

88
00:03:58.540 --> 00:03:59.890
because we haven't imported it yet,

89
00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:02.570
so let's try auto import it.

90
00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:05.310
Boom, did it work, did it work?

91
00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:07.973
Import all product query from products, good.

92
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.000
And if you had variables to pass to that query,

93
00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:17.100
you could pass them here as well, but in our case,

94
00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:19.260
there's no variables being currently passed

95
00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:20.093
to all products queries,

96
00:04:20.093 --> 00:04:22.290
so we don't have to worry about that.

97
00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:24.660
We will in the future, but not right now.

98
00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:28.720
And that's great, so when the mutation fires off

99
00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.694
and we successfully come back,

100
00:04:30.694 --> 00:04:35.694
please refetch the following queries, all products query.

101
00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.120
So, let's try it now.

102
00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:41.160
We'll go and try to sell something,

103
00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.983
we'll upload, let's do the belt.

104
00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:49.910
Nice belt, that's probably not a good idea.

105
00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:50.903
Add product,

106
00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:53.010
boom, it worked.

107
00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:55.470
Now, if I go back to the homepage

108
00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:56.740
and scroll all the way to the bottom,

109
00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:58.680
it immediately has shown up,

110
00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:02.145
because it went behind the scenes in the network

111
00:05:02.145 --> 00:05:05.470
and rerun that query for us.

112
00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:09.830
So, that is what is referred to as refetching our queries.

113
00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:12.700
In the next one, we'll get into changing the page

114
00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:17.353
once you have successfully uploaded a product.
