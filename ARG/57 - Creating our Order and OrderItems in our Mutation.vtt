1
00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:03.350
<v Wes>All right, so we're gonna keep going</v>

2
00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:05.710
with the creation of the cartItems.

3
00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:06.930
Number four is gonna be,

4
00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.920
convert the cartItems into orderItems.

5
00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:14.691
So what we'll do here is, we'll loop over the cartItems

6
00:00:14.691 --> 00:00:18.710
that are in the user's cart and make a new object,

7
00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:20.780
basically copying all the values from it.

8
00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:24.620
So we'll say const orderItems is equal to,

9
00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:26.470
and right here we're not actually gonna be creating

10
00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:27.550
the Keystone API just yet,

11
00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:29.360
we're just gonna be making a bunch of objects

12
00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:31.480
that will parse to the Keystone API.

13
00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:33.633
So, we take the cartItems,

14
00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:37.700
and we map over them.

15
00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.430
And for each cartItem that we have,

16
00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:45.090
we want to return an object.

17
00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.570
So in here, I'll just put curly brackets

18
00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:52.570
and we'll say const orderItem is equal to an object

19
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.893
where we have the name is cartItem.product.name.

20
00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.053
The description,

21
00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:04.993
the price,

22
00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:07.853
the quantity,

23
00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:13.300
is going to not be on the product itself.

24
00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:14.673
That's on the cartItem.

25
00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:22.340
The image is going to be connected to an existing one.

26
00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.180
And so this is how you make a relationship

27
00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.560
is connect where the Id

28
00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.353
is equal to the cartItem.product.photo.Id.

29
00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:36.810
And then the user is going to connect

30
00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.400
to the Id of the userId, right?

31
00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:40.770
We made that variable little

32
00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.750
at the very top of this function.

33
00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.260
So now we should have an array.

34
00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:48.950
Oh, we got to return the orderItem from here.

35
00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.010
And we probably could have just turned returned

36
00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:53.410
in front of this but I like to do it this way.

37
00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:57.330
Now we have an array of all these actual items.

38
00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.220
We need to create the order and return it.

39
00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:04.300
So say a const order is equal to

40
00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:09.300
await context.lists capital -O-.Order.createOne.

41
00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.710
And the data that we pass to that is total

42
00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:17.690
is going to be charged.amount.

43
00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.150
So, we are pulling the amount

44
00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:21.850
straight off the actual charge.

45
00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:24.850
That way we are 100% sure that that is the amount

46
00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:26.660
that was charged to their credit card.

47
00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:28.590
It should be the same as the amount of variable,

48
00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.910
but just in case anything weird ever happened,

49
00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:34.200
it will 100% line up with the credit card.

50
00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.343
The charge is going to be the charge.Id.

51
00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:41.840
That comes back.

52
00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.080
The items, now this is kind of cool,

53
00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.250
you can create a orderItems right from this.

54
00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:52.550
So here we are creating an order

55
00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:55.697
but it's going to have a relationship to many items

56
00:02:55.697 --> 00:02:57.840
and you can actually just give it an array

57
00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.050
of orderItems to create

58
00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:01.420
and it will then go ahead and make those first

59
00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.290
before it does this.

60
00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:04.870
And it's all in one single API.

61
00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:08.013
We didn't have to create them and come back with Ids.

62
00:03:08.013 --> 00:03:09.750
We just do it in one swoop.

63
00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:14.140
And then the user of this order is the same Id.

64
00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:17.210
We're gonna connect it to where the Id

65
00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:20.880
is the user Id, lower case D on that.

66
00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:25.880
Then we, let's put ourselves a little six clean

67
00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.823
up any old cart items.

68
00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:36.550
So we will const cartItem Ids is equal to

69
00:03:38.133 --> 00:03:40.933
cartItems.map.

70
00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:43.310
We'll look at the cartItem

71
00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:45.490
and just return the cartItem.Id

72
00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:49.630
And then we'll delete them.

73
00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:54.630
So we'll await context.lists.cartItem.deleteMany.

74
00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:04.420
And then that expects us to pass a read only string array

75
00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:07.650
of strings, which is Ids.

76
00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:09.820
So we'll pass it.

77
00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:11.630
The Ids

78
00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:15.000
which is we already created that remember cardItemId.

79
00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.690
So that's right here, cartItemIds.

80
00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:23.950
So that will delete all the existing cart items.

81
00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:27.950
Finally, finally, finally, we can return the order, right?

82
00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:29.750
The order that we just created right here

83
00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:32.200
we can go ahead and return it to the user.

84
00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:36.759
So if we did it right, and it's very unlikely

85
00:04:36.759 --> 00:04:37.592
(chuckles)

86
00:04:37.592 --> 00:04:39.990
what should happen is we should create the order items

87
00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:42.890
the actual order itself, we should delete the cart items

88
00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:45.680
and return the order to the user.

89
00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:46.970
If that works, then we'll flip

90
00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:51.390
onto the frontend and change the user

91
00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:53.840
to a different page based on which order they have.

92
00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:57.690
But let's not get ahead of ourselves, any it too, too much.

93
00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:59.640
So I've got to reboot this whole thing.

94
00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:04.890
All right, I'm going to go to my cart.

95
00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:06.663
And put in my credit card number.

96
00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:14.650
Cross your fingers.

97
00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:15.483
Clear it.

98
00:05:15.483 --> 00:05:16.510
Dev tools.

99
00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:17.823
Go ahead and check out.

100
00:05:20.818 --> 00:05:21.651
(arg)

101
00:05:21.651 --> 00:05:22.484
Something happened.

102
00:05:22.484 --> 00:05:23.340
Okay. That's fine.

103
00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:24.520
Let's read error

104
00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:28.780
variable data got undefined, invalid value name, data

105
00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:35.440
field type image is not defined by orderItem.

106
00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:36.793
Create input.

107
00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:38.913
Let's take a look.

108
00:05:41.435 --> 00:05:44.980
So I am creating an order item right here.

109
00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:54.130
And it's telling me, order item does not have a field image.

110
00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:57.000
So let's go to our orderItem.

111
00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.713
Did we call it photo?

112
00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:00.713
Yeah, we did.

113
00:06:00.713 --> 00:06:03.843
We did Wes Wes Wes, Wes Wes Wes

114
00:06:03.843 --> 00:06:07.303
Wes Wes Wes Wes.

115
00:06:07.303 --> 00:06:08.453
Let's try call it photo

116
00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:13.400
And let's try it again.

117
00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:14.400
I guess we've got to reboot.

118
00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:17.073
Our backend items are still in the cart.

119
00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:18.803
Fill it out.

120
00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:25.680
Cross your fingers for a second time.

121
00:06:26.713 --> 00:06:28.213
Boom, boom, boom.

122
00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:30.703
Boom.Another one.

123
00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:38.340
Th the de field user is not defined by order, correct?

124
00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:40.813
I am.

125
00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:48.050
Oh, we don't have a user field on here.

126
00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:48.883
You know what?

127
00:06:48.883 --> 00:06:49.716
That's fine.

128
00:06:49.716 --> 00:06:54.480
We don't actually need the user on the order item

129
00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:57.320
because the order item will be connected to an order, which

130
00:06:57.320 --> 00:06:59.340
in turn has access to the user.

131
00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:00.623
So let's get rid of that.

132
00:07:01.968 --> 00:07:05.100
That was something that I removed because I thought it

133
00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:06.400
was unnecessary.

134
00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:11.360
So again, this is, this is real world folks.

135
00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:15.853
You just cross your fingers and 14 times in you, you get it.

136
00:07:19.459 --> 00:07:22.250
And you can see that the error is showing up here as well.

137
00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:24.160
If you wanted, you could catch these errors

138
00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:26.240
and convert them into something

139
00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:28.590
that would be a little bit more human readable.

140
00:07:29.530 --> 00:07:32.113
Okay. This is running checkout.

141
00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:38.010
We're going to do it this time folks. This is it.

142
00:07:38.010 --> 00:07:38.843
I can feel it

143
00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:47.173
uuuuu

144
00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:48.853
We did.

145
00:07:48.853 --> 00:07:49.686
We did it.

146
00:07:49.686 --> 00:07:51.260
We did it finish the order.

147
00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:53.520
There's the data inside of that.

148
00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:54.920
There's the checkout.

149
00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:58.670
And there is the Id of the order.

150
00:07:58.670 --> 00:08:00.920
If we go into our Keystone backend

151
00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:05.920
and take a look at our orders, now, there it is.

152
00:08:06.110 --> 00:08:08.630
You see, look at the charge is this is actually coming back

153
00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:12.750
from Stripe's API and I can click through to it

154
00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:15.830
and see the items that are in that specific order.

155
00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:19.470
And then also we should be able to go to our payments page

156
00:08:19.470 --> 00:08:23.480
and see there we go there's the order that was just created.

157
00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:26.780
And then finally, we should be able

158
00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:29.470
this can be closed, obviously.

159
00:08:29.470 --> 00:08:33.840
And if I refresh this page, there is nothing in my cart.

160
00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:43.860
Although it still says 12, 12 items in my cart.

161
00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:46.080
Oh, I think I know why that is.

162
00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:47.603
I think I know why that is.

163
00:08:49.770 --> 00:08:51.920
We'll cover that in the next video

164
00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:55.890
but that is the basics of getting our order up and running.

165
00:08:55.890 --> 00:08:57.550
Now we've got to flip back once more

166
00:08:57.550 --> 00:08:59.870
to the frontend and finish up

167
00:08:59.870 --> 00:09:01.690
a few more of these little house keeping things.

168
00:09:01.690 --> 00:09:03.923
So everything looks a okay.
