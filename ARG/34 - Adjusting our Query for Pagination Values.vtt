00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:02.900
<v ->All right.</v>

2
00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:05.490
I just realized why we did this.

3
00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.270
We, we, we got the page

4
00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:12.000
at the page level and not inside of the pagination, as soon

5
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.520
as we also need the current page inside of our products.

6
00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:15.880
And it's easier just to grab it out

7
00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:19.110
of the writer once and then parse it and pass it

8
00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:23.180
in then to use rotaries, rotaries rotaries overtime.

9
00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:25.740
I don't, I don't think there's any performance issue there.

10
00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.110
You could do it either way

11
00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:31.750
but it's nice to have the current page being accessed once

12
00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:34.210
because for whatever reason, if you wanted to override it

13
00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:36.140
you simply could with this variable.

14
00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.450
So we need to now go into this products here.

15
00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:41.433
Let's just close everything else.

16
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.580
We go into our products here and we need to

17
00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:49.740
modify this query to not give us all the products

18
00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:53.910
but we want to get the first four products or two products

19
00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.670
and then we also need to offset them based

20
00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.760
on which page we currently are on.

21
00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.260
So let's take that page here

22
00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.560
and we'll pass the page to our products,

23
00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.410
and then we'll go over to our products query here

24
00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:15.460
and we need to first make it accept some variables.

25
00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:19.680
So we need to take in a skip variable

26
00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.700
that is going to be an integer

27
00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.600
that defaults to zero and the skip variable is gonna be

28
00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:25.780
how many should I skip?

29
00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.960
So if I've got one, two, three, four, five, six, seven

30
00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:33.030
eight, nine, 10 products, and we are doing two products

31
00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.080
per page, we need to, if we're on page two

32
00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.130
we need to skip the first two and get the second two.

33
00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:44.030
Right? So the skip value is going to be calculated based

34
00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:45.850
on what page we are on,

35
00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.380
and then the other variable that we need to

36
00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:49.920
pass is called first,

37
00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.350
and that will tell us, give me the first two, four, six

38
00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.360
how many per page do we need to pass?

39
00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.099
So they're called skipping first here.

40
00:01:59.099 --> 00:02:00.350
We're, we're calling them per page.

41
00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:02.683
So that is a type of integer,

42
00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:05.220
and we

43
00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:06.810
won't

44
00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.517
set a default there just

45
00:02:08.517 --> 00:02:10.320
*cause we are importing it.

46
00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:11.970
Then now that we've defined this query

47
00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:12.930
to take in arguments

48
00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.690
we need to pass it to our actual GraphQL function

49
00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:20.690
which is all products we say the first is the first variable

50
00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:25.003
and the skip is the skip variable that gets passed in.

51
00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:29.670
Then we'll go down to where we've used

52
00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.850
our products query right here, use query

53
00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:33.890
and we need to pass a couple of variables.

54
00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.020
So the second argument of use query is options.

55
00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.820
And inside of that, we can pass our variables

56
00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:43.400
and the two variables that we need to pass are skip,

57
00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:48.400
and first. So the skip value is going to be calculated

58
00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:51.390
by the current page that we are on,

59
00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.430
so we have to destructure that page

60
00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.010
because remember we passed it in right here.

61
00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:03.010
So we accept it as a prop or an argument of our page.

62
00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.030
So skip is equal to page

63
00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.680
and then we multiply that by per page.

64
00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:14.680
So that value needs to be imported from our config file,

65
00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.100
and then we also need to subtract per page

66
00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:22.760
because we want the lower end of it.

67
00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:24.750
We don't want the upper end of it.

68
00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:27.900
And then the first is simply just going to be per, per page.

69
00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:28.810
How many per page?

70
00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:29.643
So

71
00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:32.733
got go put a comma there.

72
00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:36.103
All right.

73
00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:40.263
Some broke.

74
00:03:40.263 --> 00:03:41.260
Let's let's take a look here.

75
00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:46.590
Our products dot JS is undefined undefined true,

76
00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:47.453
loading,

77
00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:56.930
had to give it old and old refresh.

78
00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:00.730
Okay. So it looks like it's, it's being piped in.

79
00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:04.830
Now, if I go to the next page, here we go.

80
00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:05.663
Look at that.

81
00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:12.310
You see how the first time, if you refresh

82
00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:14.680
and then press next, you see how it takes a second

83
00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.450
because it has to fetch them and bring them in.

84
00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:18.140
But then if I go back

85
00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:21.370
those items are in the cache of Apollo.

86
00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:22.830
So then it's nice and fast.

87
00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:25.830
That's the beauty of having the Apollo cache, is

88
00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:28.794
that if there's data that the user has already served too

89
00:04:28.794 --> 00:04:31.810
you don't need to hit the network again, to get it.

90
00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:35.130
You can simply just serve it up right from the cache.

91
00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:37.350
And that will be the topic of the next video.

92
00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:40.000
What do you do with the items in the cache

93
00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.153
so that they reflect what's actually on the server?
