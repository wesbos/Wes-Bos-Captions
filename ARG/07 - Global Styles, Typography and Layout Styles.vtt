1
00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:04.200
<v ->All right, as great as scope styles are</v>

2
00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:05.280
and we're gonna be using them

3
00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:07.930
in probably 90% of our application.

4
00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:09.830
Sometimes you do want global styles.

5
00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:11.250
And the reason behind that is

6
00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:12.810
because sometimes you want to lay down a base

7
00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:14.360
before you go ahead and build your website.

8
00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:19.360
So some, some really basic stuff like colors and fonts

9
00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:23.655
and sizing of items that all needs to happen globally.

10
00:00:23.655 --> 00:00:27.530
So you're not left redefining the same font size

11
00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:30.520
a hundred times throughout your application.

12
00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:31.840
So in order to do that

13
00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.630
we use the create global style API

14
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.520
inside of style components.

15
00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.330
And then we simply just inject that into our application.

16
00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:43.050
So we can do that via page.js.

17
00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.810
Let's go in there and let's create some global style.

18
00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:48.480
So we'll say const global styles

19
00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.460
is equal to create global style.

20
00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.910
Boom. Oh, I love that auto import.

21
00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:58.750
Import click over. See what it did.

22
00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:59.690
Vs code is the best.

23
00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:01.200
I don't know how I

24
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:04.020
how I live without it before that was so good.

25
00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:06.020
I know you're some other editors can do it

26
00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:07.610
but this is great.

27
00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:10.130
So we've create global style back ticks again.

28
00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:11.470
And then inside of here

29
00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.193
we just put any styles that we want to be globally applied.

30
00:01:15.193 --> 00:01:18.110
So first thing I'll probably want to do is let's set

31
00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:19.030
up some variables here.

32
00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.380
So I'll say HTML, you can set variables

33
00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.610
on your HTML tag or, or come a route.

34
00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:27.810
You can, you can literally set them, set them anywhere

35
00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.040
but I've always put them on HTML.

36
00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.840
And then let's take a look at what we need.

37
00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.230
So our dot dash dash red is

38
00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:41.700
is gonna be equal to pound ff one, two, three, four.

39
00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.540
That's just the basic red, black is going to be equal

40
00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:48.883
to three nine three nine three nine.

41
00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.240
You could grab these from the step solutions.

42
00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.220
If you don't wanna watch me do it here.

43
00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:57.770
Gray, a3a3a3a

44
00:02:01.614 --> 00:02:06.290
one little thing I do for the Canadians

45
00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:09.350
and the British and people who spell gray properly.

46
00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:11.610
I actually forget which one we're supposed to use

47
00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.270
but you can do this.

48
00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:17.130
And that way, if you accidentally type the wrong gray

49
00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:20.610
it will just back up to that, which is nice.

50
00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:21.803
We have a light gray.

51
00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.623
It's going to be a pound e1e1e1

52
00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:34.260
And then we will set that also to this

53
00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.350
look at that because it's auto completion.

54
00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:42.711
Boom. Cool.

55
00:02:42.711 --> 00:02:45.350
And then we've got off-white.

56
00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:46.550
That is going to be, Oh

57
00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:51.550
it's gotta be dash dash ededede ed, ed, ed.

58
00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.900
And then we got our maxwidth

59
00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.010
I always like to put like a maxwidth value

60
00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.420
in case I need to use it few times through

61
00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:05.420
I put it in a variable and that will be a thousand PX.

62
00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:09.300
And then finally I have a BS Box-shadow variable.

63
00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.090
I do this in all my projects as well

64
00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:14.170
because every time you add a Box-shadow to something

65
00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:16.260
if you like change it slightly different

66
00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.440
then your app starts looking like funky.

67
00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.300
And you're not sure you don't know why.

68
00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:21.980
So I put it in a variable so that I can always

69
00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:25.890
adjust box size, a Box-shadows in one spot,

70
00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:30.890
0 12px 24px 0 rgba is going to be 0,0,0.09.

71
00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:41.030
Actually, this does not need to be in a, it's not a string.

72
00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:45.210
It's just a CSS property.

73
00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:46.790
That's good.

74
00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:47.623
Okay, cool.

75
00:03:47.623 --> 00:03:51.453
So now let's just hop back real quick to our nav.

76
00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:55.440
Where do we use that or header?

77
00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:56.893
Where did we use black?

78
00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:58.910
There we go right here.

79
00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:01.930
So we've got the black there.

80
00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:02.763
We got the black there.

81
00:04:02.763 --> 00:04:04.849
We can take these fallbacks off.

82
00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:06.977
It doesn't hurt to, to keep the fallbacks.

83
00:04:06.977 --> 00:04:11.120
Oh, it hasn't changed yet.

84
00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:12.400
Why is it not that light gray?

85
00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.810
Well, we actually define our global styles

86
00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:16.540
but we have not used them yet.

87
00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:18.580
Now in order to just use global styles

88
00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:19.570
you can simply just go

89
00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:22.903
into your page component and inject them right in like that.

90
00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:27.000
And you see right away by injecting that

91
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.747
that turned to a lighter gray and I should be able to now go

92
00:04:30.747 --> 00:04:35.380
into the variable set we just made

93
00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:39.383
which is this one and change it to BADA55.

94
00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:42.390
And that was the wrong one.

95
00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:43.800
Should be black.

96
00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:44.960
Yeah. See in the updates

97
00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:47.913
wherever I've been used, which is awesome.

98
00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:52.220
Okay. So that's, that's our first set of global styles.

99
00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:53.240
Let's what else do we need?

100
00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:56.020
Well, we need some fonts.

101
00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:57.780
Maybe we'll do the fonts up here.

102
00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:02.500
So at font face, what do we want?

103
00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:09.410
Font family is going to be called radnika underscore next

104
00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:13.700
the source is, and this is an absolute URL

105
00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:16.720
almost always in, in JavaScript land.

106
00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:17.840
When you're building websites

107
00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:21.260
you're not referencing just static files

108
00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:25.000
but in the case of your fonts, we will be doing that.

109
00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:25.980
And you can see

110
00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:29.700
that they are stuck right here in our public static.

111
00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:31.520
We only have three files in here

112
00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:36.520
that we need so forward slash static for slash red.

113
00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:40.830
Oh man, this is gonna be hard.

114
00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:42.953
I better go here and just copy it.

115
00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:45.793
Copy name.

116
00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:48.003
Here we go.

117
00:05:52.331 --> 00:05:57.050
And we also have to say, format is waff2

118
00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:06.470
font weight is normal and font style is normal.

119
00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:09.960
Okay. Oh, this dash should not be here.

120
00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:14.960
Okay. Now, if we go down here, let's grab our body tag.

121
00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:19.130
Let's say font, family.

122
00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:22.517
I always like to use this like this, this one

123
00:06:22.517 --> 00:06:26.840
vs code will auto suggest that to you put that one in.

124
00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:29.423
That's a really good font stack

125
00:06:29.423 --> 00:06:33.370
or we'll try use this Apple system first.

126
00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:35.010
So that's a pretty good already.

127
00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:38.200
And then what we can do is we can just put

128
00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:40.410
in right in front of it.

129
00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:42.520
Where you put the new font that we just did

130
00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:45.900
which is rednika underscore next

131
00:06:47.566 --> 00:06:48.399
There we go

132
00:06:48.399 --> 00:06:51.120
That's looking pretty slick while we're here.

133
00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:52.990
Let's let's do a little bit of reset.

134
00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:55.550
Now you could import normalize that CSS

135
00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:58.600
or you can just write a couple resets yourself.

136
00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:02.160
What we'll do here is we'll go

137
00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:06.780
on our HTML and we'll say box sizing, border box

138
00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:16.650
and let's grab star star before and star after.

139
00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:21.670
Oh, look at this double triple

140
00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:25.663
we'll say box sizing inherit.

141
00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:29.730
Not we'll make sure that when we add padding and border

142
00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:31.960
to an element it takes away from the size

143
00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:32.793
instead of growing it.

144
00:07:32.793 --> 00:07:34.090
And that's how you get a lot

145
00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:37.550
of these weird horizontal scroll bugs.

146
00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:39.250
Let's go back to the body here.

147
00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:42.060
And let's just say padding zero margin zero

148
00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:44.340
font size 1.5rem

149
00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:53.040
line height is 2, look at that, it's looking better already.

150
00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:55.160
I'll go below that.

151
00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:58.090
Let's just select and style all of our links.

152
00:07:58.090 --> 00:08:00.310
So would you say a text decoration

153
00:08:00.310 --> 00:08:04.393
none color as far dash dash black.

154
00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:07.733
All right.

155
00:08:07.733 --> 00:08:09.500
That's looking pretty good.

156
00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:13.890
We should put a hover on them just for now.

157
00:08:13.890 --> 00:08:15.320
So we know when we're hovering them.

158
00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:17.220
We'll change that once we hit the thing

159
00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:20.893
we'll say a hover text, decoration, underline,

160
00:08:22.390 --> 00:08:23.523
look I'm pretty good.

161
00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:26.460
And then it just

162
00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:28.630
the one like little weird thing is you also

163
00:08:28.630 --> 00:08:31.890
have to select your buttons and apply the font family

164
00:08:31.890 --> 00:08:36.820
to it because for whatever reason, setting a font

165
00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:41.460
on the body does not also apply to buttons, which is odd.

166
00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:43.820
So we just have to, we gotta put that in globally.

167
00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:45.820
Okay. So that's all of our global styles.

168
00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:49.810
I believe they've been injected into our page.

169
00:08:49.810 --> 00:08:50.643
Next up.

170
00:08:50.643 --> 00:08:54.600
What I wanna do is I just want to style all of this

171
00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:56.830
right here, H well, we really don't need these two

172
00:08:56.830 --> 00:08:58.980
but the whatever is wrapped around that.

173
00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:01.230
So we can constrain the width and I'll call

174
00:09:01.230 --> 00:09:02.220
that inner style.

175
00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:06.090
So say const inner styles is equal to style dot.

176
00:09:06.090 --> 00:09:10.110
It's a diff in this case, and it looks like style

177
00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:10.943
is not imported.

178
00:09:10.943 --> 00:09:13.000
So let's go ahead and do that.

179
00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:14.193
Let's triple check.

180
00:09:15.690 --> 00:09:16.523
There we go.

181
00:09:16.523 --> 00:09:17.356
It's important there.

182
00:09:19.330 --> 00:09:21.140
And we'll just give it a max-width

183
00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:29.290
of VAR dash dash maxwidth

184
00:09:32.390 --> 00:09:37.390
we'll center it margin zero auto and padding 2rem.

185
00:09:40.970 --> 00:09:42.810
All right, let's see.

186
00:09:42.810 --> 00:09:43.810
That's not working yet.

187
00:09:43.810 --> 00:09:46.040
Cause we haven't put it up against.

188
00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:49.210
So let's go and take that inner styles now where

189
00:09:49.210 --> 00:09:50.930
we see this, we can get rid of this.

190
00:09:50.930 --> 00:09:52.156
We're not testing anymore.

191
00:09:52.156 --> 00:09:54.250
We're we're actually writing code now.

192
00:09:54.250 --> 00:09:57.810
Open it up and then put your children inside of that.

193
00:09:57.810 --> 00:09:59.960
So we've got our global styles

194
00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:03.050
we've got our header and then we ever inner styles.

195
00:10:03.050 --> 00:10:05.960
And that is all of the content that goes inside

196
00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:10.170
of here will be set off from that.

197
00:10:10.170 --> 00:10:12.070
All right, this is looking pretty good in the next video.

198
00:10:12.070 --> 00:10:15.710
Let's go over how to visually see what's happening when

199
00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:16.753
you change the page.
