1
00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:04.070
<v Instructor>So the problem that we're hitting</v>

2
00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:05.300
are not necessarily a problem.

3
00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:07.230
But what we're hitting is when we delete an item

4
00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.060
and it actually doesn't disappear

5
00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:10.600
until you refresh the page.

6
00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:12.470
And that's because that item's deleted

7
00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:15.270
from the database but it still exists in memory.

8
00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:20.270
Still exists in the actual cash of our all products query.

9
00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.030
So what we need to do is,

10
00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:25.910
we could just refresh that query,

11
00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:28.320
but sometimes, and this is the case a lot of times,

12
00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.760
is you don't want to go to the network

13
00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:31.820
and refresh all of them.

14
00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:33.690
You just wanna say, well, I just deleted that one,

15
00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.230
so just take it out, right.

16
00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:40.200
So Apollo has a really nice API called Evict.

17
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.630
And it basically just take it out of the cache,

18
00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:44.780
React will notice that the cache change

19
00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:46.190
and it will re-render

20
00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.900
and take that item on out.

21
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.670
So, the way that works is

22
00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.080
you create an update function that you pass along

23
00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:56.370
with your use mutation.

24
00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.200
So here we have our use mutation

25
00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.410
and we pass it variables.

26
00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:02.310
You can also pass it in another argon

27
00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:04.880
which is our update function.

28
00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:06.830
And the update function will run

29
00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:09.840
when the mutation comes back.

30
00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.670
So I'm just going to say update

31
00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.610
and we have a function called update.

32
00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:14.860
And then we'll go up here.

33
00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:17.300
So this is not inside a component or anything.

34
00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.770
And just make a function called update.

35
00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.690
That update function gives us access to the cache.

36
00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:25.080
That's the Apollo cache.

37
00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.870
As well as the payload.

38
00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:29.830
The payload is what gets returned

39
00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:33.690
from the update of the mutation.

40
00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:37.053
So remember here, when we ran our delete product,

41
00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:39.870
and we asked that when I delete it,

42
00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:41.913
can you give me the ID and the name.

43
00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:45.380
In our case what's gonna happen is that

44
00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.140
we're going to be supplied with the ID and the name

45
00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.800
of the item that was deleted.

46
00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.810
So that we can take that payload

47
00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.280
and remove it from the cash.

48
00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.150
Let's just go ahead and log out here.

49
00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:04.150
That says console.log.

50
00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:06.550
Let's just say payload.

51
00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:08.990
We don't need to log the cash, we know what that is.

52
00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:12.610
So, and then we'll also console.log

53
00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:17.063
running the update function after delete.

54
00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.000
Let's just do it once to show you what's happening here.

55
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.125
So go to our console, clear it out.

56
00:02:25.125 --> 00:02:27.740
Let's take this hoodie here, delete it.

57
00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:29.810
Go ahead, boom.

58
00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:31.960
And you see it was deleted, a split second later

59
00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:32.793
once it came back

60
00:02:32.793 --> 00:02:34.860
for the network, running the update,

61
00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.390
open up the object, inside of there's data.

62
00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:39.870
And then we see both the name and the ID.

63
00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.640
As long as the type name is inferred--

64
00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:43.710
Or not inferred.

65
00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:45.400
It's send over by default.

66
00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.070
But it gives us whatever items we actually wanted to delete.

67
00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:52.510
So the way that we can remove that item from the cash

68
00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.790
is we run cache.evict

69
00:02:56.767 --> 00:02:59.620
and then you need to pass it referenced

70
00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:00.840
to the actual item.

71
00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.380
And we don't have reference to the item.

72
00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:06.040
We just have this object that came back.

73
00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.690
And the way that you can find--

74
00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:08.620
It's kind of weird

75
00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.340
because you gotta find the item in the cache

76
00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:11.830
and then you gotta evict it.

77
00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:14.640
So the way that you can find the item in the cache

78
00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.950
is with cache.identify

79
00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:23.960
and you pass it just on payload.

80
00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:27.563
So payload.data.deleteproduct.

81
00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:32.180
So payload is this, data, delete product.

82
00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:33.470
So you give it this.

83
00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:37.920
And based on the information that is in here,

84
00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:39.570
which is type name and ID.

85
00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:41.810
I don't know if it uses the name or not to find it.

86
00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:44.710
But the type name and ID are all that's needed

87
00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:47.620
for it to identify where that item is

88
00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:49.520
in our Apollo cache.

89
00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:51.860
And based on that it will identify it.

90
00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:52.880
It will find it.

91
00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:55.600
And then we pass that item to cache.evict

92
00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:58.380
and that will boop, take it out entirely.

93
00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:03.380
So, we can refresh, go to our console here,

94
00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:04.920
delete this windbreaker here.

95
00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:05.770
Delete.

96
00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:07.420
Okay.

97
00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:08.253
Cache.indentify.

98
00:04:10.725 --> 00:04:12.475
(laughing)

99
00:04:12.475 --> 00:04:14.058
IDENTIFY, identify.

100
00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:16.993
Okay so one more.

101
00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:21.680
Vapormax delete, okay.

102
00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:22.513
Boom!

103
00:04:22.513 --> 00:04:23.990
You see how it was removed.

104
00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:26.200
And the Yeti came on up.

105
00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:27.923
That is exactly what we want.

106
00:04:29.501 --> 00:04:31.050
If you took this course previously,

107
00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:32.890
that was like, I don't know,

108
00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:35.470
30 lines of code previously.

109
00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:37.530
And now it's a couple of minute video

110
00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:38.710
with cache.evict.

111
00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:41.020
So that is new in Apollo Three.

112
00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:42.893
And a very nice API.
