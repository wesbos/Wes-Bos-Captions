00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:02.180
<v Wes>Alright, hold on to your pants,</v>

2
00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:03.350
because, in this video,

3
00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:06.300
we are going to be making things look great.

4
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:09.250
We're gonna be using a library called Styled Components

5
00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:11.230
in order to write the CSS

6
00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:14.036
that we need to style our application now.

7
00:00:14.036 --> 00:00:18.380
Let's talk about CSS in React real quick,

8
00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:22.290
so there's a couple ways to do CSS in a React application.

9
00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:25.840
The most basic being, do it the way you've always done it.

10
00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:27.320
So, what you can do

11
00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.540
is you can simply write your CSS in a .css file.

12
00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:33.270
You could open up your meta file,

13
00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.190
and just do a regular old link tag,

14
00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:37.870
and then, inside of all your components,

15
00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:39.700
you can add classes to your elements,

16
00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:41.580
and select them based on that,

17
00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:42.413
and you're good to go.

18
00:00:42.413 --> 00:00:45.910
Or, you can run SASS, and compile that to CSS,

19
00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:47.412
and put it in there.

20
00:00:47.412 --> 00:00:50.140
However, there is a fairly popular way

21
00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:52.810
of writing CSS in React application

22
00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:56.940
that's sort of got the name CSS in JS.

23
00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.730
Used to be called Inline CSS,

24
00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:02.680
which I think rubbed people wrong, the wrong way.

25
00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.440
So, it's sort of settle on CSS in JS.

26
00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.674
And, essentially, what that means

27
00:01:07.674 --> 00:01:10.074
is you are writing the styles for your application

28
00:01:10.074 --> 00:01:13.320
inside of your JavaScript application,

29
00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.070
and usually they're fairly coupled

30
00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.980
with the actual components that need to be created.

31
00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:21.560
So, if I have a button that needs to be

32
00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.911
red and white text and a certain font size,

33
00:01:24.911 --> 00:01:28.580
I might couple that with the actual button itself

34
00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:30.070
because they go together.

35
00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:32.950
Or, even when style components in a couple of

36
00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:35.310
these libraries you can make a reusable button

37
00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.620
that you can use to write your application.

38
00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:39.650
Similar to how you would create a class

39
00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:42.120
that you could reuse throughout your entire application.

40
00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:44.840
Now, what's the benefit of that?

41
00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.530
Well, the biggest benefit of it

42
00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.430
is that you don't have the concept of global styling.

43
00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.140
We do, we're actually going to be using that.

44
00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.320
But, if you write a specific styles for that button,

45
00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.560
there's no way for it to leak outside

46
00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.760
and maybe accidentally apply those styles to something else.

47
00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:05.160
Have you ever written some CSS

48
00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.110
where you applied a class to something

49
00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.390
or you wrote a selector based on an element

50
00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:13.270
and then something else on the page broke

51
00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:16.120
because the styles accidentally applied to that?

52
00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.870
With this, we're really going to be containing our styles.

53
00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.610
Now, there's all kinds of opinions

54
00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.160
whether this is the best way or a terrible way

55
00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.413
or if people have a problem with CSS,

56
00:02:25.413 --> 00:02:28.130
then you might already have, like, you may be using them.

57
00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:29.350
You might be really happy with that,

58
00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:32.108
and I would encourage you to keep going with that,

59
00:02:32.108 --> 00:02:36.130
if you are familiar and you're comfortable with that.

60
00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:39.300
So, I'm not really forcing any one on anyone,

61
00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.320
but we are going to be using Styled Components in this.

62
00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:43.750
There's a whole bunch of other ones.

63
00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.527
A whole bunch of other CSS in JS1's.

64
00:02:45.527 --> 00:02:47.626
But, I really like this one.

65
00:02:47.626 --> 00:02:49.620
I use it in my own applications,

66
00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.510
and the reason why I like it the best

67
00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:55.440
is because it looks exactly like normal CSS.

68
00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.850
Some of them have you writing objects

69
00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:00.380
where you have to camelcase stuff,

70
00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:01.860
and you have property values,

71
00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.948
and it gets a little bit hairy.

72
00:03:03.948 --> 00:03:07.090
And, if your doing media queries it gets pretty hairy.

73
00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:09.425
And, in this, you are writing your CSS

74
00:03:09.425 --> 00:03:12.364
just as if you are writing it in a .dot CS file.

75
00:03:12.364 --> 00:03:15.370
And, that's what I really like about it,

76
00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:16.780
with a couple little exceptions.

77
00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:19.640
So, let's take a look at how this actually works.

78
00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:21.800
First of all, before you even get started,

79
00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.850
make sure that you have a, if you're using VS code,

80
00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:28.250
grab the VS code styled components extension

81
00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:29.910
and what that's going to do is it's going to give you

82
00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:33.943
regular CSS highlighting inside of our JavaScript files.

83
00:03:33.943 --> 00:03:38.943
Now, the way that we us style components is, well,

84
00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:40.760
let's back it up.

85
00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.360
Open up page.js and let's give ourselves

86
00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:45.510
just a regular button.

87
00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:46.770
Oh, a button.

88
00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:49.020
A button that says click me.

89
00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:50.750
And, if I wanted to make this button

90
00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:53.580
red with white text and a large font size,

91
00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:56.160
normally what you'd do is give it a class name

92
00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:57.760
of, like, a button

93
00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.470
and then you might use like ben, or button.

94
00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:02.010
Underscore, underscore, large,

95
00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:04.560
and then maybe button underscore, underscore,

96
00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.290
large dash, dash, red.

97
00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:08.040
You get the point, right?

98
00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.190
You can go on from there.

99
00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:10.620
But, that's not what we want to do.

100
00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:11.740
With styled components,

101
00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:14.840
you essentially replace the actual element itself

102
00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:19.210
with a custom component that has the styles attached to it.

103
00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:20.620
So, we can go up here

104
00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:24.664
and import styled from Styled Components,

105
00:04:24.664 --> 00:04:28.082
and that styled inside of it has access

106
00:04:28.082 --> 00:04:30.650
to all the different elements that you might want to create.

107
00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:31.530
So, we can go here

108
00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:35.563
and say const MyButton is equal to styled.

109
00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:39.920
And, then, we simply choose the element

110
00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:40.790
that we wish to create.

111
00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:41.900
Might be a div.

112
00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:43.090
Might be a unordered list.

113
00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:44.570
Might be a h1 tag.

114
00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:46.542
In our case, we want to make a button

115
00:04:46.542 --> 00:04:48.960
and you give it back text.

116
00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:50.930
Now, if you've taken my ES6 course,

117
00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:52.930
you'll know that this is what is called

118
00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:54.880
a tag template literal,

119
00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:57.620
where it works similar to how a function works,

120
00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:59.970
where you can just have a button

121
00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:01.600
and put all of your styles in here.

122
00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:03.160
But, instead of it being a function

123
00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:04.398
and passing it arguments,

124
00:05:04.398 --> 00:05:07.430
it's just a string that has been tagged

125
00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:09.750
with this specific styled.button,

126
00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:11.840
and then inside of there we simply just go

127
00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:16.840
and say, like, background: red, font-size: 100px,

128
00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:21.740
and then we go down here to where the button is

129
00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:24.190
and you replace that with your custom component,

130
00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:25.699
which is MyButton.

131
00:05:25.699 --> 00:05:29.340
And, then, that is essentially just going to create

132
00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:32.877
a button HTML element with the following styles

133
00:05:32.877 --> 00:05:34.460
that have been attached to it.

134
00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:37.610
And, we're gonna see how we can put these in separate files.

135
00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:39.480
You can export and import them

136
00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:41.670
and make them reusable throughout your entire application.

137
00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:43.550
But, for now, I'm just putting them in the same file.

138
00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:45.740
If we go back to our application here.

139
00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:46.738
Oh, there we go.

140
00:05:46.738 --> 00:05:50.890
We see that our button is now being used,

141
00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:53.800
and anytime that I want those styles to be applied,

142
00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:56.515
I can just use the component MyButton,

143
00:05:56.515 --> 00:06:00.090
as many times as I want, and it is going to apply styles.

144
00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:00.923
Under the hood,

145
00:06:00.923 --> 00:06:04.620
you can actually see what it's doing in HTML CSS land,

146
00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:08.893
as it gives it these kinda unique classes VvnLs,

147
00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:14.360
and there you see that the CSS is being applied to it.

148
00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:17.150
Now, there's a couple more things we need to know

149
00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:18.830
about how Style Components work.

150
00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:20.490
Let's go into those right now.

151
00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:24.755
What happens if you have, like, a span inside of it,

152
00:06:24.755 --> 00:06:29.070
and, inside that span, you maybe have like, I don't know,

153
00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:30.296
a poop emoji,

154
00:06:30.296 --> 00:06:33.640
and you want to make that poop emoji even bigger.

155
00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:34.890
Let's make this 50px.

156
00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:40.230
And, you got the poop emoji.

157
00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:43.390
Like, how do you make this poop emoji even bigger?

158
00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:45.906
Well, there's kinda two options here.

159
00:06:45.906 --> 00:06:47.810
First of all, what you can do

160
00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:50.350
is you can make another styled component,

161
00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:55.350
const BigPoop is equal to, don't tweet this, styled.span

162
00:06:56.488 --> 00:07:00.690
and we'll say font size 100px.

163
00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:05.580
And, then, we just swap out our span with a BigPoop,

164
00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:11.660
and you'll see that it is swapping it out.

165
00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:14.531
However, that probably seems like a little bit much

166
00:07:14.531 --> 00:07:18.460
because it's likely that this big poop

167
00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:20.930
is always going to be inside of my button.

168
00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:23.370
And, if you don't need to reuse this big poop

169
00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:25.772
anywhere else in this entire project,

170
00:07:25.772 --> 00:07:28.771
then you can just bring it back to a span

171
00:07:28.771 --> 00:07:32.800
and get rid of the second component that we've created.

172
00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:35.490
And, you can just use like nested selectors inside of here.

173
00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:39.395
So, you can just say span, it's going to be font-size 100.

174
00:07:39.395 --> 00:07:42.912
And, that will give us exactly what we're looking for.

175
00:07:42.912 --> 00:07:44.860
What I really like about that

176
00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:47.910
is there's no need to actually give this a class,

177
00:07:47.910 --> 00:07:49.990
unless you had a couple spans in there

178
00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:52.420
and you want to target that one specifically.

179
00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:55.160
But, there's no use in having

180
00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:57.459
very specific class names inside of here

181
00:07:57.459 --> 00:07:59.987
because I'll never have to,

182
00:07:59.987 --> 00:08:02.980
I only have to be as specific as I need it.

183
00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:03.813
In this case,

184
00:08:03.813 --> 00:08:05.875
I can just grab the span that's inside of it, right?

185
00:08:05.875 --> 00:08:10.548
If you wanted to, you could give it a class name of poop.

186
00:08:10.548 --> 00:08:14.835
And then you go up here and just swap that out with a .poop,

187
00:08:14.835 --> 00:08:16.957
and, if we inspect it,

188
00:08:16.957 --> 00:08:19.150
you'll see that it still looks exactly the same.

189
00:08:19.150 --> 00:08:21.080
But, if you were to inspect it,

190
00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:23.430
you'll see that the class is poop,

191
00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:26.040
which could be tainted from outside,

192
00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:28.477
but the selector that we have written

193
00:08:28.477 --> 00:08:33.230
has that unique identifier being applied to each one.

194
00:08:33.230 --> 00:08:34.610
So, I'm a big fan of that.

195
00:08:34.610 --> 00:08:36.740
I tend to not go overboard

196
00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:38.980
with creating individual style components,

197
00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:41.660
unless I find myself being like, huh,

198
00:08:41.660 --> 00:08:44.030
I'd like to reuse that one little piece.

199
00:08:44.030 --> 00:08:45.880
Maybe I'll refactor that out

200
00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:48.890
into a separate styled component

201
00:08:48.890 --> 00:08:52.480
that I can reuse throughout the application.

202
00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:54.179
Otherwise, I think it's fine to use

203
00:08:54.179 --> 00:08:58.420
nested selectors inside of your main component

204
00:08:58.420 --> 00:08:59.434
that you have here.

205
00:08:59.434 --> 00:09:01.240
Otherwise, I find it gets a little bit out of hand.

206
00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:04.430
You'll probably stumble upon a cadence similar to that

207
00:09:04.430 --> 00:09:08.115
or something that you prefer for you and your team.

208
00:09:08.115 --> 00:09:10.310
The last thing that we need to know

209
00:09:10.310 --> 00:09:14.700
about these styled components is that they can have props.

210
00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:17.720
So, if I just had a huge prop right here.

211
00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:21.210
What we can do is, inside of here,

212
00:09:21.210 --> 00:09:23.940
because this is just JavaScript at the end of the day.

213
00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:26.200
We have the entire language of JavaScript

214
00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:28.660
available to us to do things like logic,

215
00:09:28.660 --> 00:09:30.760
and if statements and switches,

216
00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:32.020
and whatever you would like.

217
00:09:32.020 --> 00:09:34.278
So, I could just replace font-size

218
00:09:34.278 --> 00:09:38.550
with a interpolated string right here,

219
00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:40.350
'cause, remember, this is just back text

220
00:09:40.350 --> 00:09:41.183
at the end of the day.

221
00:09:41.183 --> 00:09:43.640
So, we can use our ES interpolation here

222
00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:46.380
and you have to give it a function.

223
00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:51.380
So, you say props and we'll use a arrow function here.

224
00:09:51.410 --> 00:09:55.260
And, say props .huge,

225
00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:57.830
if that is true the font size is going to be a 100px,

226
00:09:57.830 --> 00:10:01.253
otherwise it's going to be 50px.

227
00:10:02.730 --> 00:10:05.290
And, got a bit of an error here.

228
00:10:05.290 --> 00:10:06.590
I think I goofed up something.

229
00:10:06.590 --> 00:10:07.860
Here we are, I forgot a quote.

230
00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:08.693
Good.

231
00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:12.080
And, you see that it's huge there,

232
00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:13.858
but, if I were to duplicate this button

233
00:10:13.858 --> 00:10:17.600
and not have the huge attribute on,

234
00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:19.290
the other one should be a bit smaller.

235
00:10:19.290 --> 00:10:22.100
So, you can create a sort of variance on it.

236
00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:25.940
You can pass arguments to it by doing something like

237
00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:30.940
huge="100" and you can literally pass the value

238
00:10:31.370 --> 00:10:33.576
to the CSS if you wanted to do that.

239
00:10:33.576 --> 00:10:35.510
It's really nice and flexible.

240
00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:36.990
I'm a big fan of it.

241
00:10:36.990 --> 00:10:38.150
And, that's what we're going to be using

242
00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:39.800
throughout this course.

243
00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:41.340
So, with that said,

244
00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:43.130
let's go through and start scaffolding out

245
00:10:43.130 --> 00:10:44.632
the rest of the application.

246
00:10:44.632 --> 00:10:47.832
Getting our fonts in place, getting our theme values,

247
00:10:47.832 --> 00:10:49.210
that's one thing we haven't done,

248
00:10:49.210 --> 00:10:51.090
is you can also use theme values

249
00:10:51.090 --> 00:10:52.274
inside of Styled Components.

250
00:10:52.274 --> 00:10:54.991
And, just get it looking decent,

251
00:10:54.991 --> 00:10:57.100
so that we can start cutting loose,

252
00:10:57.100 --> 00:11:00.050
learning GraphQL get Prisma set up and all that good stuff.

253
00:11:00.050 --> 00:11:01.780
So, let's back this up,

254
00:11:01.780 --> 00:11:04.333
which is unnecessary for our actual application.

255
00:11:04.333 --> 00:11:06.818
Delete, delete, delete, delete.

256
00:11:06.818 --> 00:11:08.720
Good.

257
00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:10.170
And, then, I will remove.

258
00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:12.574
That's kinda nice VS code will gray out

259
00:11:12.574 --> 00:11:15.060
any import statements that are unused,

260
00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:16.710
so you can just remove them from there.

261
00:11:16.710 --> 00:11:18.260
I'll see you in the next video.
