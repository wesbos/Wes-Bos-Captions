1
00:00:00.165 --> 00:00:01.470
(whooshing)

2
00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:02.860
<v Instructor>Let's get uploading images.</v>

3
00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:04.820
So for uploading images in this course,

4
00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:06.610
we're gonna be using something called Cloudinary.

5
00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:08.900
Cloudinary is a service

6
00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:11.410
with a very generous free tier.

7
00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:13.900
The really cool thing about Cloudinary

8
00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:15.790
is that they'll resize things based on width

9
00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:17.770
and height and they'll change it from a PNG

10
00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:19.310
to a WebP if they need to

11
00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:22.480
and the quality can be dumbed down

12
00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:23.620
if you want it to be smaller.

13
00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:25.302
And all of your image problems

14
00:00:25.302 --> 00:00:28.000
can be solved with Cloudinary.

15
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.730
And you can also use it with the new image tag

16
00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:33.840
inside of Next.js, which is pretty, pretty cool.

17
00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.970
So you could use Cloudinary direct on your website

18
00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:41.010
or you could just use Cloudinary for uploading images

19
00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.510
and then use the Next image tag to actually display them.

20
00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:45.770
So we'll get into that.

21
00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:47.714
But what I want you to do

22
00:00:47.714 --> 00:00:50.990
is to sign up for a Cloudinary account,

23
00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:54.340
if you haven't already and then go into your dashboard.

24
00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:58.590
It's going to show you right here your cloud name,

25
00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.290
your API key and your secret.

26
00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:02.013
We're gonna need those in just a second.

27
00:01:02.013 --> 00:01:04.057
Please generate your own.

28
00:01:04.057 --> 00:01:06.440
I just logged into my tutorial account

29
00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.760
and I saw that 5,482 people

30
00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:15.090
or maybe less than that have been uploading random images

31
00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.920
to my own account, which I thought was pretty funny.

32
00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.360
So get your own API keys.

33
00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.880
Obviously, look at that, all these people doing that.

34
00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.290
I'm still well within my limits on here,

35
00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:27.180
which is pretty funny.

36
00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.957
So let's get into doing that.

37
00:01:30.957 --> 00:01:35.957
Now, images in Next.js, we could just make a field

38
00:01:36.144 --> 00:01:38.740
on our product called image

39
00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:40.550
and allow someone to upload it

40
00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:42.300
but better yet what we're gonna do

41
00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:44.670
is we're gonna create an entirely new data type

42
00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.810
called ProductImage and then we're gonna have a relationship

43
00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:48.994
of that ProductImage

44
00:01:48.994 --> 00:01:51.220
with the actual product

45
00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:53.260
and what that will allow us to do,

46
00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:54.310
any time in the future,

47
00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.990
if you wanna associate multiple products

48
00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:58.050
with a single image

49
00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:59.610
or if you wanna make a gallery

50
00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:00.820
and you wanna browser images.

51
00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:02.260
The sky's the limit

52
00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.670
when you make something its own data type,

53
00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:05.570
which is pretty cool.

54
00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:08.190
So we're gonna go into our .env file.

55
00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.562
And we've gotta fill these out right here.

56
00:02:10.562 --> 00:02:13.181
So first one, wesbostutorial.

57
00:02:13.181 --> 00:02:18.181
Again, get your own API key right there

58
00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:24.270
and I'm going to take my API key and put it in there.

59
00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:25.366
You can see it there.

60
00:02:25.366 --> 00:02:28.710
I probably should change it after I deploy this course.

61
00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:32.600
One thing I'm wondering is is that dash gonna trip us up?

62
00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:33.630
You can always put quotes

63
00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.300
around your strings in your .env file

64
00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.840
if you're wondering about that and I'm gonna do

65
00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.150
that just so I don't run into some stupid issue

66
00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.510
or I've gotta reboot the server 'cause it broke.

67
00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:48.010
Okay, next, we're gonna go into our schemas

68
00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:49.000
and make a new file

69
00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.480
and we'll call that capital P,

70
00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.923
ProductImage, capital I, .ts.

71
00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.193
And just like before,

72
00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:00.360
we are going to make our ProductImage.

73
00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.073
So export const ProductImage

74
00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:07.550
is equal to, so again, it's a list,

75
00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:10.020
just like every data type that we have.

76
00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:12.033
We'll have to import the list.

77
00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:15.690
That worked, good.

78
00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:19.750
Then inside of that, we have our fields.

79
00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:20.820
We have our image

80
00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:23.790
and that is going to be a Cloudinary image.

81
00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.163
So we'll say cloudinaryImage.

82
00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:29.800
And inside of that,

83
00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:32.610
we are going to pass it our cloudinary config.

84
00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:34.240
Let's just call that cloudinary for now

85
00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:37.363
and then label is going to be Source.

86
00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:41.410
Besides that, we also wanna pass a spot

87
00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:43.610
to pass altText, which is just a text field.

88
00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:46.010
Okay, so we have a couple things

89
00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:47.520
that we need to be imported and created here.

90
00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:50.290
First, let's start with the easy stuff, text.

91
00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:52.173
Let's auto import that.

92
00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:54.303
Okay.

93
00:03:54.303 --> 00:03:55.773
And now cloudinaryImage.

94
00:03:56.674 --> 00:03:59.433
I'm gonna import that from,

95
00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:09.380
it's gonna be from keystone-next/cloudinary.

96
00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:10.433
That's the one.

97
00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:14.010
And then this one, oh, I've gotta spell it right.

98
00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:14.843
Cloudinary.

99
00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:18.250
We've gotta create the config for that.

100
00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:21.310
So up here, we'll say export const cloudinary

101
00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:23.603
is equal to that.

102
00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:27.350
What's wrong with my highlighting here?

103
00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:28.630
What did I break?

104
00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:30.170
Oh, we forgot the from here.

105
00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:31.083
There we go.

106
00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:33.830
Inside of that, we say cloudName

107
00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:41.100
is going to be process.env.cloudinary.

108
00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:43.120
Here, let's open our .env file

109
00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:44.750
and just copy, paste them.

110
00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:47.163
CLOUD_NAME, KEY, SECRET.

111
00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:51.060
Let's just boop,

112
00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:55.930
and each of these will have to get a process.env

113
00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:57.470
in front of it

114
00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:58.853
and then it's cloudName.

115
00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:04.183
Its apiKey.

116
00:05:07.083 --> 00:05:11.110
apiSecret and then finally, we have a folder,

117
00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:13.710
which you don't have to specify the folder

118
00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:15.384
and then they'll just get dumped

119
00:05:15.384 --> 00:05:18.020
into your media library

120
00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:21.850
but in my case, I'm going to say it's called sickfits

121
00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:26.820
and that is our Cloudinary config

122
00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:31.313
and that gets passed to this cloudinaryImage right here.

123
00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:37.450
Now we can inject that into our keystone.ts file.

124
00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:40.330
So we'll go down here, Product,

125
00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:43.070
it's not a ProductImage, boom.

126
00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:45.263
Let's double check that imported.

127
00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:48.050
It did.

128
00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:51.793
And we should be able to now just kill this and restart it.

129
00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:56.390
And see that we can make data by ourselves.

130
00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:57.290
All right, we got a bit of an error.

131
00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:59.390
CloudinaryAdapter required a cloudName,

132
00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:01.070
apiKey, and apiSecret.

133
00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:02.580
Ah, I ran into this once.

134
00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:04.561
It drove me crazy.

135
00:06:04.561 --> 00:06:09.561
So I am passing these right now

136
00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:12.439
and the reason that it's not working

137
00:06:12.439 --> 00:06:16.870
is because it's an environmental variable.

138
00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:19.620
And if you wanted to figure out if that was working,

139
00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:23.500
you could just console.log that

140
00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:26.060
and then usually I do something obnoxious around it,

141
00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:29.933
like log something like that.

142
00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:34.563
And then start it again.

143
00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:39.160
And you'll see it's undefined.

144
00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:42.640
Okay, and I was like what is going on?

145
00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:45.520
And it was because it did not import that .env.

146
00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:47.500
Remember we did this?

147
00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:49.780
Import.env/config.

148
00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:52.970
Apparently you've gotta do that on every single file

149
00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:55.210
where you wanna access environmental variables.

150
00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:57.033
Watch, now if we start it again,

151
00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:02.400
we get wesbostutorial, which is the value

152
00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:05.090
that we have in our environmental variable.

153
00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:10.090
So let's get rid of that console.log in our ProductImage.

154
00:07:13.532 --> 00:07:16.420
And then we'll take a look at our backend here.

155
00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:21.580
If we refresh, you see we have Product Images.

156
00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:24.000
Now let's try go and create a product.

157
00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.483
I wanna upload an image.

158
00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:29.420
We'll give it a black hole.

159
00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:30.713
Create product image.

160
00:07:31.605 --> 00:07:33.740
Boom, we've uploaded it

161
00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:38.173
and now I believe if we go to our Cloudinary dashboard here,

162
00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:43.703
we should see it.

163
00:07:43.703 --> 00:07:46.640
There we go, that's one I just uploaded

164
00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:48.650
a couple seconds ago.

165
00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:50.800
All right, so that's the first bit

166
00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:51.880
but the second bit,

167
00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:53.350
and then we're gonna cover that in the next video,

168
00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:56.330
is how do we carry a relationship between the product

169
00:07:56.330 --> 00:07:58.700
and the actual product image?

170
00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:00.353
So I'll see you in that.
