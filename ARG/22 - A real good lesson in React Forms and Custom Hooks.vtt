1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.780
(swoosh)

2
00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:05.140
<v ->We've done the query, we've written one query so far</v>

3
00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:06.990
and we've pulled in the items.

4
00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:08.730
Now we need to learn about the flip side

5
00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.238
which is what if you want to push data into our graphfield,

6
00:00:12.238 --> 00:00:14.930
GraphQL API to create stuff,

7
00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:17.370
and that is what we're gonna do on the sell page.

8
00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:19.000
So this is a bit of a big one,

9
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.500
and I wanna make sure that we understand

10
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.640
all the moving pieces to it,

11
00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.080
because honestly, if we nail this,

12
00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:27.870
you'd be able to make any app you want because you're,

13
00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:28.703
you have the
(chuckles)

14
00:00:28.703 --> 00:00:32.020
two basic things now which is pulling data and creating data

15
00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:33.950
and then we'll learn how to update the data.

16
00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:38.503
So let's get into that, we're gonna go into our,

17
00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:43.900
we go to our pages here, and we have our sell.js,

18
00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:45.280
we're gonna create a new component

19
00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:46.840
in our components directory,

20
00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.110
and we're gonna call that CreateProduct.js.

21
00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.238
And we'll do our whole song and dance export,

22
00:00:56.238 --> 00:01:00.850
let's find out what the Reactkeyboard is for,

23
00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.283
Reactfunctional component.

24
00:01:04.147 --> 00:01:07.090
Reactfunctional component, export.

25
00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:09.973
Maybe that's it, let's try it, RFCE.

26
00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:15.060
Okay, okay.

27
00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.220
See, that's a little bit different than what I wanted,

28
00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.130
because like first of all in Next.js

29
00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.020
and actually in JSX in general,

30
00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.260
you don't need to import React anymore, it's assumed,

31
00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.000
and then also I like to just export default

32
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.710
where I write the function.

33
00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.130
So, that's okay, it's kind of cool

34
00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:33.550
because it infers the name of the function

35
00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:35.943
from the file name, which, I like that.

36
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.740
Okay, so what we'll do, we'll work with that.

37
00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.840
Next up what we need to do is we need a form

38
00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.180
and working with forms in Reactcan be a little bit tricky,

39
00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:48.170
and I wanna show you how to like

40
00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:49.820
make that a little bit easier on yourself.

41
00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:51.650
So let's build the form first,

42
00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:55.200
and then we'll deal with the mutation of submitting it

43
00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.650
and then we'll also deal with how to upload an image

44
00:01:58.650 --> 00:01:59.700
to the back end, so

45
00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:02.763
let's start with a form tag here,

46
00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:07.703
and let's go in here and give ourselves a label.

47
00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:13.850
And that is going to be for the name.

48
00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:16.010
And then inside of that we want to input,

49
00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.033
with the type of text, and it has an ID of name.

50
00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.157
It also needs a name of name.

51
00:02:25.157 --> 00:02:26.340
(laughing)

52
00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:31.340
And then a placeholder of name.

53
00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.750
And then we can also put the word name right here.

54
00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.660
Okay, let's see how that looks.

55
00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.470
We'll go into our Sell.js,

56
00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.500
and inside of here we will, let's just return a div,

57
00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:47.210
and then we'll put a CreateProduct component in there,

58
00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:51.990
and then we'll import that sucker from where we defined it.

59
00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:54.820
All right, so we have our name input here.

60
00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:59.260
Now, if we wanna hook up an input to some state in React,

61
00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:00.730
I'm gonna show you how to do that

62
00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.380
and then I'm gonna show you how to make a use form hook

63
00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:06.790
so that we can sort of automate it for multiple ones,

64
00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:11.790
so the way that hooking up state to a form input works

65
00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:13.030
is usually do something like this,

66
00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:15.770
so we're going to say const,

67
00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:20.590
and we'll say, let's call it name, and set name,

68
00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.003
and then we'll say useState,

69
00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.650
and we'll set the default state to be Wes.

70
00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:27.730
Okay, so useState is a hook,

71
00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:29.400
we got to import that from React

72
00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.070
so import use state from React.

73
00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:36.090
And then what we'll do is we have this piece of state,

74
00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:37.250
which is reactive,

75
00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:39.510
meaning that when that piece of state changes,

76
00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:42.050
it will be updated wherever it's used,

77
00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:45.303
and if you wanna use state in an input in React,

78
00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:47.603
it looks something like this,

79
00:03:47.603 --> 00:03:50.190
so you say value is equal to, curly bracket,

80
00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:52.940
and then you give it your piece of state, right.

81
00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:54.790
So let's open up our dev tools here

82
00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:58.133
and make sure we see any errors going on here.

83
00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:03.570
So here we are, immediately we get an error warning,

84
00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:06.560
you provided a value prop to a form field

85
00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.300
without an on change handler.

86
00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:11.240
This will render a read only field if the field

87
00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:13.120
should be immutable use default value

88
00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.487
otherwise set an on change or read only, right,

89
00:04:15.487 --> 00:04:17.883
and so if I try to type into here.

90
00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:21.370
Nothing, why not?

91
00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:22.880
Like why can't you type into it?

92
00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:27.370
And that's because React is very, very, very strict,

93
00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:32.040
strict, strict about the whole idea of

94
00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:34.860
one single source of truth.

95
00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:37.730
And if you have stayed in an input

96
00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:39.600
and then you change that input,

97
00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:43.110
all of sudden you have your data, your state in two places,

98
00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:46.400
you have it in state, but you also have it in the input box,

99
00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.250
and those can get out of sync really quickly

100
00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:49.410
and that's a big headache.

101
00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:52.610
So, what React does with forms is it says,

102
00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:57.160
all right, you need to listen for a change event

103
00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:59.570
on an input, and when that happens,

104
00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:02.500
you need to intercept what the user had typed,

105
00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:04.110
put it back into state,

106
00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:05.587
and then that will trigger a rerender

107
00:05:05.587 --> 00:05:08.000
and then update the value on there.

108
00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.793
So, how that works is we say onChange.

109
00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:15.010
And we can do a little function up here,

110
00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:17.133
we'll do it in line, say event.

111
00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:22.630
And let's just console.log the event to see what we got

112
00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:24.530
working with right here so,

113
00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:26.350
I'm gonna put, type in x.

114
00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:27.183
Boom.

115
00:05:27.183 --> 00:05:29.653
So, this is our event that happened.

116
00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:32.430
And then, in there,

117
00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:34.510
there's a whole bunch of information

118
00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:37.090
about what had happened,

119
00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:38.300
so e.target.

120
00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:41.900
So if we console log e.target, that's the actual input,

121
00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:44.543
and then if we grab the value off of that,

122
00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:49.560
we should see what it is that I hoped I typed,

123
00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:53.110
so I'm gonna type x boom, see there we go, wesx,

124
00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:55.920
but React immediately backspaces it for us

125
00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:57.100
and says no, no, no, no,

126
00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:02.010
you may only show what is set to your piece of name state.

127
00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:06.170
So what you have to do is we have to run set name,

128
00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:08.323
and e.target.value.

129
00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:13.660
And now when I type into this,

130
00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:16.240
you'll see that the state is going to be synced with it,

131
00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:17.380
we can go a little bit further

132
00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:20.120
and open up our React dev tools here,

133
00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:24.107
and we can look for our form here.

134
00:06:24.107 --> 00:06:25.620
I'm gonna click on create product.

135
00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:29.200
You see the state that is associated,

136
00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:30.853
sorry I can't make it any bigger.

137
00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:34.003
But as I change this,

138
00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:37.650
you see that it's updating inside of

139
00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:39.660
the state of that component.

140
00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:42.030
So that's not that bad right, like you,

141
00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:43.440
for every single input that you have,

142
00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:44.760
you make a little piece of state

143
00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:48.440
and then you put a piece of set name on it.

144
00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:51.440
Now, where that can get a little out of hand is like,

145
00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:54.280
what if you've 15 inputs on a form right.

146
00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:55.750
And there's whole libraries,

147
00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:58.640
there format is a really, really nice one for React

148
00:06:58.640 --> 00:06:59.550
if you're doing forms,

149
00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:01.820
but in most of my projects,

150
00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:04.330
I don't necessarily need an entire library for my forms,

151
00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:09.330
I just need to the ability to sync some state of inputs

152
00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:11.880
and have it all in a single object.

153
00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:14.690
So, to handle that, what we do is

154
00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:17.010
I like to create a use form hook

155
00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:19.030
that has a little bit of logic inside of that

156
00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:20.730
and we're gonna do that right now.

157
00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:24.483
So we're gonna go into our lib folder,

158
00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:26.740
right along format money

159
00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:30.303
and we're gonna create a new file called useForm.js.

160
00:07:32.942 --> 00:07:37.470
And we're gonna export default function useForm.

161
00:07:38.645 --> 00:07:41.010
And that will take in some initial state

162
00:07:41.010 --> 00:07:43.730
and we'll just default that to be an empty object,

163
00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:47.250
just in case someone doesn't pass in any default state.

164
00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:49.680
Then what we'll do is we'll create our own state,

165
00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:51.230
so let's do common here,

166
00:07:51.230 --> 00:07:56.230
create in a state object for our fields,

167
00:07:58.230 --> 00:08:00.861
or for our inputs, let's call it inputs,

168
00:08:00.861 --> 00:08:02.860
const, inputs

169
00:08:04.410 --> 00:08:06.760
and set inputs is equal to

170
00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:09.080
and then we'll use a state inside of a hook.

171
00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:12.200
So what we're doing is we're gonna do the exact same thing,

172
00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:14.830
but we're gonna tuck away the complexity of

173
00:08:14.830 --> 00:08:16.240
that multiple pieces of state

174
00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:17.790
and handling updates and whatnot,

175
00:08:17.790 --> 00:08:20.690
we're gonna tuck it away into its own custom hook

176
00:08:20.690 --> 00:08:22.760
that we've may of called useForm,

177
00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:25.520
and that will allow us to

178
00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:28.040
simply just write a couple lines at the top of this one

179
00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:30.710
and use as many form inputs as we want.

180
00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:34.650
So use state, we got to import use state from Reactgood,

181
00:08:34.650 --> 00:08:39.250
and then inside of here we will pass it our initial state,

182
00:08:39.250 --> 00:08:42.350
just in case someone does pass some initial state.

183
00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:44.840
Next up we need to make a little function

184
00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:47.160
called handleChange

185
00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:50.760
and that is going to be the function that gets passed

186
00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:53.560
to the on change handler right here,

187
00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:55.750
so we don't have to manually do it each time,

188
00:08:55.750 --> 00:08:58.780
we can just pass it a little handle change function

189
00:08:58.780 --> 00:09:01.860
and it will do the sort of the heavy lifting for us.

190
00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:03.970
So that will take in the event.

191
00:09:03.970 --> 00:09:08.000
And then in here we simply are just gonna say set inputs.

192
00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.490
Now, in this case we don't just say, e.target

193
00:09:13.817 --> 00:09:14.650
.value,

194
00:09:14.650 --> 00:09:16.530
and the reason behind that is because

195
00:09:16.530 --> 00:09:21.280
state is gonna be an object where we have the name input,

196
00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:25.870
and we have the description input, nice shoes,

197
00:09:25.870 --> 00:09:27.920
and the price input.

198
00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:30.220
So it's gonna have a couple different values,

199
00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:32.000
so let me leave that there just so we can visualize

200
00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:33.400
what we're working with right here.

201
00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:36.580
So when you are dealing with an object

202
00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:39.240
of multiple pieces of state here,

203
00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:43.370
what you need to do is you need to set the entire thing

204
00:09:43.370 --> 00:09:47.980
to be an object, you need to copy the existing state,

205
00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:48.813
so ...

206
00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:52.250
inputs,

207
00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:53.140
that's our piece of state

208
00:09:53.140 --> 00:09:55.400
so let's write a little comment right here,

209
00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:58.893
we'll say, copy the existing state.

210
00:10:00.170 --> 00:10:02.020
And then below that we need to just

211
00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:03.420
update the piece of state,

212
00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:05.790
so in our case, if it was the name input,

213
00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:10.790
we would just say, e.target.name or .value sorry,

214
00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:15.310
our e.target is gonna be the actual input itself

215
00:10:15.310 --> 00:10:17.560
and the value is whatever the user typed in there.

216
00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:18.440
The problem with that is

217
00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:20.500
we don't know if it's gonna be the name input,

218
00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:22.720
or if it's gonna be the price input,

219
00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:24.933
let's go ahead and duplicate this here.

220
00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:30.320
And we could change this to price,

221
00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:32.890
and then every single time we have name

222
00:10:32.890 --> 00:10:34.673
on there, there, there,

223
00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:38.200
it would say price,

224
00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:40.610
this I guess stays name.

225
00:10:40.610 --> 00:10:44.243
So, that's kind of weird where you have to,

226
00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:47.660
it has to be dynamic.

227
00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:49.840
So if we run the function against this one,

228
00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:53.550
it has to be for price, if we run the function for this one,

229
00:10:53.550 --> 00:10:55.140
it's gotta be for the name.

230
00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:58.700
So what we'll do is we'll make this little part dynamic,

231
00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:02.670
where we can use dynamic properties, or sorry as like a,

232
00:11:02.670 --> 00:11:04.520
it's kind of like using a variable,

233
00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:06.850
or it is using a variable as the property name so,

234
00:11:06.850 --> 00:11:11.850
say e.target.name is set to e.target.value.

235
00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:15.123
And let me just show you real quick what that is.

236
00:11:16.050 --> 00:11:17.170
I gotta comment out of this price

237
00:11:17.170 --> 00:11:18.683
just for real quick second.

238
00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:22.880
And if we console log e.target.value

239
00:11:24.130 --> 00:11:26.423
and e.target.name,

240
00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:30.643
we should see here,

241
00:11:32.510 --> 00:11:33.900
the name is name

242
00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:36.700
and the value is whatever we typed into there.

243
00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:40.393
And if we were to change the name of this to price.

244
00:11:43.180 --> 00:11:44.500
You see it says price here

245
00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:48.170
so we were able to make it flexible and dynamic that way

246
00:11:48.170 --> 00:11:51.380
by using a variable or a property

247
00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:53.470
as the actual property of the object,

248
00:11:53.470 --> 00:11:56.420
and what that will do is if we have an existing name,

249
00:11:56.420 --> 00:11:57.730
it will just overwrite it

250
00:11:57.730 --> 00:11:59.410
because it comes later in the object,

251
00:11:59.410 --> 00:12:01.330
and that's how we don't have to like,

252
00:12:01.330 --> 00:12:03.170
we don't have to worry about deleting the old name,

253
00:12:03.170 --> 00:12:07.360
it will just overwrite it and handle that update for us.

254
00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:09.650
Okay, so that is our handle change function,

255
00:12:09.650 --> 00:12:12.450
there's a whole lot more logic that needs to go in here,

256
00:12:13.939 --> 00:12:15.370
but right now we're just going to

257
00:12:15.370 --> 00:12:17.899
deal with the very basic handle change.

258
00:12:17.899 --> 00:12:22.899
Then, if you want to surface, either functionality,

259
00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:26.600
or data from a custom hook,

260
00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:29.290
you must return it from that custom hook.

261
00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:30.340
So what we're gonna do is

262
00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:35.340
return the things we want to surface from this custom hook.

263
00:12:37.110 --> 00:12:39.360
So we'll say return as an object

264
00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:41.060
and we're gonna return the inputs.

265
00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:46.363
We are also going to return the handle change function.

266
00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:51.530
So, what we can do now is we can go back

267
00:12:51.530 --> 00:12:55.600
and update that function to use our use form hook,

268
00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:59.263
so we'll go right here, we're no longer gonna use use state,

269
00:13:00.345 --> 00:13:03.610
and we're gonna say const curly bracket inputs

270
00:13:03.610 --> 00:13:08.610
and handle change is equal to use form,

271
00:13:08.710 --> 00:13:11.300
and we'll go ahead and import that use form.

272
00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:12.980
There we go, we no longer need use state,

273
00:13:12.980 --> 00:13:14.530
you can take that out of there.

274
00:13:15.864 --> 00:13:17.800
Now, you might be asking,

275
00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:19.920
Wes, why was that other one square bracket

276
00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:21.750
and then this one is curly bracket?

277
00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:25.180
And that's because we are returning an object here,

278
00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:29.320
and we're destructuring the inputs inhale change values.

279
00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:32.500
So, you see here, const inputs, handleChange, useForm,

280
00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:34.230
then we can go and update this,

281
00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:38.470
so value is equal to inputs.name,

282
00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:45.717
and on change, simply can just be Handlechange.

283
00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:50.350
One thing we do need to do, you see there's an error here,

284
00:13:50.350 --> 00:13:51.320
it's saying

285
00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:53.910
a component is changing controlled to uncontrolled,

286
00:13:53.910 --> 00:13:54.970
we do need to set our

287
00:13:54.970 --> 00:13:57.620
initial values for that form inside of here,

288
00:13:57.620 --> 00:13:59.610
so we'll say name is equal to,

289
00:13:59.610 --> 00:14:01.510
and I this just for testing purposes,

290
00:14:01.510 --> 00:14:04.960
I like to put some dummy data in there like nice shoes,

291
00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:09.793
let's say price is equal to something like that description,

292
00:14:10.700 --> 00:14:15.200
it's going to be, these are the best shoes

293
00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:17.323
and we'll leave it at that for now.

294
00:14:18.580 --> 00:14:21.163
So let's just make sure that still works.

295
00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:25.400
There we go see nice shoes.

296
00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:29.200
And if I were to go to my React dev tools,

297
00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:31.740
go to our create product component.

298
00:14:31.740 --> 00:14:36.370
You see, our hooks, we have our form hook,

299
00:14:36.370 --> 00:14:37.563
and then we have state,

300
00:14:38.490 --> 00:14:42.233
and as I am changing the value of this input,

301
00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:44.993
let's say like backpack,

302
00:14:46.630 --> 00:14:50.670
it is then being updated in the state that we have there.

303
00:14:50.670 --> 00:14:54.640
So we just made like a really flexible thing here,

304
00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:57.850
we should be able to now reuse that whole

305
00:14:57.850 --> 00:15:00.280
song and dance for both the price

306
00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:02.330
and the description in any other fields that we want.

307
00:15:02.330 --> 00:15:04.030
So let's go do this next one here.

308
00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:08.570
The uncomment and VS code doesn't, look at it, like,

309
00:15:08.570 --> 00:15:13.180
it's never worked for me, you can never uncomment in JSX,

310
00:15:13.180 --> 00:15:15.350
should probably open issue about that.

311
00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:18.420
Okay, so label for price, type is equal to,

312
00:15:18.420 --> 00:15:21.160
we can even do like a number if you wanted to.

313
00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:24.100
ID is price, name is price, placeholders price,

314
00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:27.430
value is inputs.price,

315
00:15:27.430 --> 00:15:30.120
and then the on change handler is simply just

316
00:15:31.713 --> 00:15:32.796
handleChange.

317
00:15:34.477 --> 00:15:35.470
There we go.

318
00:15:35.470 --> 00:15:38.180
And we can click these, the tiniest buttons in the world,

319
00:15:38.180 --> 00:15:40.520
like how useless is this input number.

320
00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:42.270
There we go, look at it.

321
00:15:42.270 --> 00:15:43.660
And it updates the value

322
00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:46.340
and you can obviously type in here as well.

323
00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:49.840
One kind of gotcha that we just run into is watch this,

324
00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:51.290
let me refresh the page again

325
00:15:52.870 --> 00:15:57.740
and open up a state, like this is a number.

326
00:15:57.740 --> 00:15:59.420
See, there's no quotes around it,

327
00:15:59.420 --> 00:16:02.123
and as soon as I change it.

328
00:16:04.330 --> 00:16:05.163
You see it,

329
00:16:05.163 --> 00:16:06.270
it pops quotes around it,

330
00:16:06.270 --> 00:16:08.180
so that's gonna be a bit of a bit of a problem

331
00:16:08.180 --> 00:16:10.450
because it's supposed to be a number,

332
00:16:10.450 --> 00:16:12.840
and if we send it to our GraphQL API

333
00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:15.800
as a string with quotes around it, it's gonna say, hey,

334
00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:20.250
I was expecting a number but you gave me a string,

335
00:16:20.250 --> 00:16:22.100
what's going on here?

336
00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:24.560
And the thing about HTML inputs is they

337
00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:25.760
always give you a string,

338
00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:27.470
even if it's a type of number.

339
00:16:27.470 --> 00:16:30.160
So what we can do is we'll go back to our custom hook

340
00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:32.893
and just tuck away a little bit more logic.

341
00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:35.793
We'll go up here.

342
00:16:37.370 --> 00:16:39.340
And let's first destructure

343
00:16:39.340 --> 00:16:44.340
the name, the type and the value from the target.

344
00:16:44.710 --> 00:16:46.473
So it's a const, curly bracket.

345
00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:50.880
We have the value, we need the name and we need the type

346
00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:53.460
and we're gonna pull that off of the e.target.

347
00:16:53.460 --> 00:16:58.140
So again, e.target is going to be the input.

348
00:16:58.140 --> 00:17:00.240
And we're simply just gonna be pulling the type,

349
00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:02.903
the name and the value off of it.

350
00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.133
And then we can,

351
00:17:08.180 --> 00:17:10.950
oh, oh, that's wrong, we don't wanna do it up there,

352
00:17:10.950 --> 00:17:13.490
we gotta do it inside of our change handler.

353
00:17:13.490 --> 00:17:15.369
And then we can simply instead of saying,

354
00:17:15.369 --> 00:17:17.890
you know, target.name, and e.target.value,

355
00:17:17.890 --> 00:17:22.860
we just say name and value, but what we wanna do here is,

356
00:17:22.860 --> 00:17:27.860
we'll say, if the type is equal to number,

357
00:17:28.130 --> 00:17:30.570
then what we wanna do is we wanna say value

358
00:17:30.570 --> 00:17:32.437
is equal to parseint(value).

359
00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:35.510
And now, this is not gonna work

360
00:17:35.510 --> 00:17:38.473
because these are const, so change that to a let.

361
00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:45.780
And now I believe when we change the value in here,

362
00:17:46.490 --> 00:17:51.430
it's now being updated as an actual number.

363
00:17:51.430 --> 00:17:53.180
There's one more thing we can do here,

364
00:17:53.180 --> 00:17:54.900
and let's just code this ahead of time,

365
00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:59.510
if it's a file, it requires an array of files,

366
00:17:59.510 --> 00:18:03.880
so we'll say if the type is equal to file,

367
00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:08.400
then the value square bracket zero is equal to

368
00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:11.370
e.target.files,

369
00:18:11.370 --> 00:18:13.170
and that's just a little bit different

370
00:18:13.170 --> 00:18:14.937
when you're working with files,

371
00:18:14.937 --> 00:18:19.937
you need to set the first item in the array to be the files.

372
00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:24.210
That's just how file uploads works, it's a little bit funky,

373
00:18:24.210 --> 00:18:29.210
other little pieces of handy functionality we need is,

374
00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:33.340
if we wanna ever reset the form back to the initial state,

375
00:18:33.340 --> 00:18:37.330
not empty state but the initial state is,

376
00:18:37.330 --> 00:18:41.533
we can simply do this, function, reset form.

377
00:18:43.130 --> 00:18:47.800
And we'll just say setInputs to be initial.

378
00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:50.150
So, we'll take in the initial inputs

379
00:18:50.150 --> 00:18:51.310
and just set them back

380
00:18:51.310 --> 00:18:52.700
so if you ever wanna have a,

381
00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:54.890
I screwed up reset it to what we started with,

382
00:18:54.890 --> 00:18:58.420
and then we'll expose that from the hook right there.

383
00:18:58.420 --> 00:19:02.210
And then we do also need another one called clearForm

384
00:19:02.210 --> 00:19:03.940
which is different than resetting,

385
00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:07.580
but we wanna just zero out all the inputs.

386
00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:09.993
And this is kind of a fun one that I was working on,

387
00:19:09.993 --> 00:19:13.780
I was like, huh, how do you make an,

388
00:19:13.780 --> 00:19:18.040
how do you take an object and loop over all the properties

389
00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:22.140
and set them to be just nothing, right.

390
00:19:22.140 --> 00:19:23.580
And what I came up with is this,

391
00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:27.050
this constant blank state is equal to,

392
00:19:27.050 --> 00:19:30.000
and so, if you want,

393
00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.850
if you have an object like const person is equal to name

394
00:19:33.850 --> 00:19:34.943
is Wes,

395
00:19:35.930 --> 00:19:38.470
price, I don't know why a person has price,

396
00:19:38.470 --> 00:19:43.350
but age six, or whatever, and job is dev.

397
00:19:43.350 --> 00:19:46.110
Okay, all right, so I got this person object here.

398
00:19:46.110 --> 00:19:48.663
If you wrap that in object.entries,

399
00:19:50.830 --> 00:19:52.700
it will give you an array

400
00:19:52.700 --> 00:19:57.082
where each item in the array is another array

401
00:19:57.082 --> 00:19:57.915
(laughing)

402
00:19:57.915 --> 00:20:00.850
and each item in that array is the first thing is

403
00:20:00.850 --> 00:20:03.300
the property, and the second thing is the value.

404
00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:07.603
So what we're gonna do is we're gonna loop over that,

405
00:20:08.730 --> 00:20:12.880
and set each of these keys to be nothing,

406
00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:16.080
so we'll do that, we'll say, object

407
00:20:20.437 --> 00:20:25.330
.entries, and take the inputs, which is our initial state,

408
00:20:25.330 --> 00:20:26.933
and we'll map over it.

409
00:20:28.930 --> 00:20:33.600
And so let me show you here, map, and then we say map,

410
00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:38.600
and then for each of those, we're gonna get the item.

411
00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:43.200
And let's, I can just return like the item or item zero,

412
00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:44.470
that would give us the keys,

413
00:20:44.470 --> 00:20:47.400
item one would give us the values.

414
00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:51.730
And you can destructure this item a little bit further

415
00:20:51.730 --> 00:20:54.070
by saying the first thing will be called key,

416
00:20:54.070 --> 00:20:56.620
and the second thing will be called value,

417
00:20:56.620 --> 00:21:00.410
and then you could just return the key

418
00:21:02.460 --> 00:21:04.483
or the value,

419
00:21:05.570 --> 00:21:07.350
or in our case, what we're gonna do is,

420
00:21:07.350 --> 00:21:09.600
we're gonna return the key,

421
00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:12.840
and then just nothing for the second value.

422
00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:13.990
And then, look at this,

423
00:21:15.110 --> 00:21:17.800
name, price, age, job, right.

424
00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:19.443
So we can go here, map,

425
00:21:20.730 --> 00:21:22.633
destructure key and value.

426
00:21:23.900 --> 00:21:27.560
And then we'll return an array where we have the key,

427
00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:31.650
and just an empty string, or you could even pass a null,

428
00:21:31.650 --> 00:21:32.610
all of them will work,

429
00:21:32.610 --> 00:21:34.610
empty string I think worked fine for me.

430
00:21:37.150 --> 00:21:40.860
Then, how do we, like if we take something like this,

431
00:21:40.860 --> 00:21:42.440
how do we turn that back into an object?

432
00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:43.960
'Cause this is still an array,

433
00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:48.153
we'll you wrap it in another object.fromEntries.

434
00:21:50.970 --> 00:21:51.803
Boom.

435
00:21:51.803 --> 00:21:52.750
And what that does

436
00:21:54.130 --> 00:21:56.940
is it will then clear out the object for you,

437
00:21:56.940 --> 00:21:57.773
so,
(chuckles)

438
00:21:57.773 --> 00:22:02.290
essentially we turn it into an array, map over it,

439
00:22:02.290 --> 00:22:04.540
set the value to no on each,

440
00:22:04.540 --> 00:22:06.260
or value to empty string on each

441
00:22:06.260 --> 00:22:08.680
and then we turn it back into an object

442
00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:10.720
with object.fromEntries.

443
00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:14.393
So we'll do that, Object.fromEntries.

444
00:22:21.771 --> 00:22:22.604
Here we go,

445
00:22:22.604 --> 00:22:26.823
and then we can simply just say, set inputs, blank state.

446
00:22:28.020 --> 00:22:30.050
And then we'll surface that clearForm,

447
00:22:30.050 --> 00:22:31.100
we're gonna use that once

448
00:22:31.100 --> 00:22:33.380
when somebody has created something,

449
00:22:33.380 --> 00:22:34.930
we're gonna clear the form for them

450
00:22:34.930 --> 00:22:38.250
so that they don't have their old values in there.

451
00:22:38.250 --> 00:22:39.360
And like we could even,

452
00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:41.990
we could even just hook that up to a button right now.

453
00:22:41.990 --> 00:22:44.180
So if we go to our create product,

454
00:22:44.180 --> 00:22:46.893
say button, clearForm.

455
00:22:50.020 --> 00:22:55.020
Say, on click is equal to, whether we call it clearForm.

456
00:22:58.060 --> 00:23:02.660
And we'll have to destructure that clearForm from here,

457
00:23:02.660 --> 00:23:04.940
so handle change, clearForm,

458
00:23:04.940 --> 00:23:06.943
let's also get the reset form as well.

459
00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:10.500
So I think now when we click it, does it work?

460
00:23:11.710 --> 00:23:12.890
It does.

461
00:23:12.890 --> 00:23:15.350
It also refreshes the page,

462
00:23:15.350 --> 00:23:19.950
and I believe we can, see it's telling me it needs a type.

463
00:23:19.950 --> 00:23:20.783
Yeah.

464
00:23:20.783 --> 00:23:23.083
So button, type of button.

465
00:23:27.243 --> 00:23:28.600
There we go, look at that!

466
00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:31.250
And then like let's do it again, let's duplicate that

467
00:23:31.250 --> 00:23:33.493
and then just say, resetForm,

468
00:23:35.660 --> 00:23:40.283
then I believe we can just pipe in a resetForm value here.

469
00:23:43.380 --> 00:23:47.090
Look it goes back, clearForm, resetForm.

470
00:23:47.090 --> 00:23:48.940
Type a whole bunch of stuff in there,

471
00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:53.700
price is ridiculous, oh no, I don't wanna charge that much,

472
00:23:53.700 --> 00:23:55.920
reset it back to what we started with.

473
00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:56.930
Whoo!

474
00:23:56.930 --> 00:23:57.763
Beautiful.

475
00:23:57.763 --> 00:23:59.800
Okay, so I'm gonna stop there,

476
00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:03.570
that was basically just a mini lesson in custom Reacthooks

477
00:24:03.570 --> 00:24:06.480
and dealing with state and whatnot.

478
00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:08.970
In the next one we'll get into

479
00:24:08.970 --> 00:24:10.270
building this out a little bit more

480
00:24:10.270 --> 00:24:12.523
for actually adding the rest of the fields.
