00:00:01.248 --> 00:00:03.760
<v Wes>In this video, we need to do a little bit of layout,</v>

2
00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:07.040
both visually, in terms of what the overall layout

3
00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.180
of what our application is going to look like,

4
00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:11.720
as well as, like, a architecture for something

5
00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:13.660
that's a little bit higher than these pages.

6
00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:15.070
So let me explain, kind of,

7
00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:16.680
what the problem is that we have right now.

8
00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.987
We've got this index.js, and we've got this cell.js.

9
00:00:19.987 --> 00:00:22.930
These are sort of as high as you can go

10
00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:26.810
in the component tree, in our React application right now,

11
00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:28.950
and that's not too much of an issue,

12
00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:31.370
but there becomes a bit of a problem when

13
00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:34.360
what happens when you wanna share data between pages?

14
00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:37.087
Like, you're going from index to cell.

15
00:00:37.087 --> 00:00:40.720
What's the parent of both of these pages?

16
00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:43.530
Where would I put my state, right?

17
00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.000
So, Next.js, by default, actually wraps

18
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.160
your entire application in what's called an app component,

19
00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.360
and that's great, because you can get up and running,

20
00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.330
really quickly, and it will give you its own app component.

21
00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:58.008
However, sometimes you want to do custom.

22
00:00:58.008 --> 00:01:00.520
You want to have, like, a custom wrapper component

23
00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:03.060
around all of the pages, and that's where

24
00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:04.960
we get into running a custom app,

25
00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.770
and it says it perfectly, here.

26
00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.990
It's good for persisting layout between pages,

27
00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.930
it's good for keeping state when navigating pages,

28
00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.930
so the fact that I can add something to my cart, right here,

29
00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.450
and I can open my cart, and then I can go to another page,

30
00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:25.820
and the fact that the cart is still open

31
00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:27.550
and it knows what's in my cart,

32
00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:30.348
that's persisting state between pages,

33
00:01:30.348 --> 00:01:31.490
and that's exactly what we're gonna do

34
00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:33.700
with our Apollo store.

35
00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.740
So in order to do this, you create a custom app.

36
00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.170
The name of the file is going to be underscore app.js,

37
00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:43.150
and then, inside of here, what we do is we

38
00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:47.870
import the app component and the container component,

39
00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:51.450
which is exported from next forward slash app.

40
00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.100
We're actually gonna be coming back to this

41
00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.650
and significantly coding it out,

42
00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:57.130
once we get into making our Apollo store,

43
00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:58.870
but let's do very basics, right now.

44
00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:01.560
So, we make a new React component,

45
00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:02.450
that's going to wrap everything.

46
00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.210
We'll call that MyAPP,

47
00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:06.650
and that extends, not React.component,

48
00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:09.230
but it extends the app component

49
00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:12.405
that we imported from next/app, which is good,

50
00:02:12.405 --> 00:02:13.740
and then let's just go ahead

51
00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.623
and export default MyApp, right away,

52
00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:20.313
and then inside of here, we'll have a render,

53
00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:26.413
where we need to grab the component from this.props.

54
00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:31.260
And then from here, we return that container component

55
00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.590
that we have imported from next,

56
00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.090
and then inside of that, we can put something like

57
00:02:37.938 --> 00:02:40.488
hey, I'm on every page, and then render out the ...

58
00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:42.820
Oh, what am I doing here?

59
00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:45.900
Const component from, how does JavaScript work?

60
00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:46.733
Equals.

61
00:02:46.733 --> 00:02:49.840
We destructure the component value from the stop props,

62
00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.700
and then inside of here,

63
00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:56.250
we render out the component that we have.

64
00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:00.600
So, what this does, is a component is going to be

65
00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.450
cell or index, when we visit the page,

66
00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:06.510
and then it should also pop a paragraph tag

67
00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:08.560
on top of every page that we have,

68
00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.800
so I'll give it a refresh, doesn't seem to be working.

69
00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.630
We maybe have to give it a restart.

70
00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:15.690
Let's open up our terminal, here,

71
00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:19.170
kill it, start it again, there we go.

72
00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.910
Hey, I'm on every page, go to cell.

73
00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:24.970
You can see that it's now being wrapped in every single one,

74
00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:29.523
and if we are open up our React dev tools that we have here,

75
00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:32.750
you'll see that's our app container,

76
00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:35.280
this is our app component that we've created,

77
00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.860
and then our container has hey, I'm on every page,

78
00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:39.720
and then it will have the actual component

79
00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:40.553
that we're trying to render.

80
00:03:40.553 --> 00:03:42.699
In this case, it's home, but if I click on cell,

81
00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:46.669
it'll swap just that component out, really quickly,

82
00:03:46.669 --> 00:03:49.500
and still persisting everything else that we have, there,

83
00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.300
and you can imagine that if we were

84
00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:54.090
to put a Redux store, or our Apollo store,

85
00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:56.950
or just local state, inside of my app,

86
00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:00.383
that state would stay from one page to another.

87
00:04:01.482 --> 00:04:03.960
Now we actually wanna take this paragraph,

88
00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:06.130
Hey I'm on every page, we actually wanna take that out

89
00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:08.000
because this app.js is actually not

90
00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.450
where we wanna put that stuff.

91
00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:13.230
We wanna factor that out into its own page component.

92
00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:14.320
So what we're going to do here

93
00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:16.370
is we're going to go into our components folder

94
00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:20.350
and make a new file called capital P Page.js.

95
00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:24.170
I'm going to import React and make a component, so rcc tab.

96
00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:28.150
I have this little package called Reactjs code snippets

97
00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:30.080
and so do half a million of you.

98
00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:32.160
I highly recommend that you install it

99
00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.800
because it can do things like rcc

100
00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:39.000
and that will import React, import the component,

101
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.670
by the way it doesn't really matter,

102
00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:43.600
it doesn't matter at all, if you import the component

103
00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:46.330
like that or if you do React.component,

104
00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:48.010
both will work just fine.

105
00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:48.843
I'm gonna stick with this just

106
00:04:48.843 --> 00:04:50.579
because that is what the snippet does.

107
00:04:50.579 --> 00:04:55.480
And then it exports it all in one go.

108
00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:58.380
That's totally fine, you can also export default

109
00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:04.080
page at the end of it, whatever is your preference.

110
00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:07.410
And inside of here, we are just going to have a &lt;div&gt;.

111
00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:12.410
Let's just put a paragraph, Hey I'm the page component,

112
00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:16.133
and then down here we'll say this.props.children,

113
00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:19.300
and that will render out anything.

114
00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:21.830
Now we'll go back to our app.js component

115
00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:24.500
and we'll import the page component

116
00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:28.570
from the components folder and the page component,

117
00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:31.323
and then we'll wrap that in a page component.

118
00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:36.940
Beautiful, now we'll go back here,

119
00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:38.240
Hey I'm the page component.

120
00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:40.670
When I go back and forth between all of them

121
00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:42.880
you see that our page component is always

122
00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:45.470
going to be wrapping each of them.

123
00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:48.940
And that's great because if you ever want different layouts

124
00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:51.100
you can create different page components that you want,

125
00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:53.890
it's all, it can all be factored into its own component.

126
00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:57.440
Now, inside of this page.js we're going to be doing things

127
00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:00.710
like theming and styling the width

128
00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:02.140
and the height of all these things,

129
00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:04.720
but that's gonna come in a feature video.

130
00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:05.680
For now we just need to know

131
00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:07.560
that we have this page component.

132
00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:08.940
Now inside of this page component,

133
00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:11.890
we can start writing components for things

134
00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:14.240
that need to show up on absolutely every page,

135
00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:15.430
just like we have this paragraph tag.

136
00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:17.400
So let's actually remove that

137
00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:19.050
and let's make a header component.

138
00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:21.430
So in our components folder we'll make a new file,

139
00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:23.800
capital H header.js.

140
00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:28.200
In that we'll say const header is equal to

141
00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:32.180
a stateless functional component,

142
00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:34.810
and inside of that we'll have a &lt;div&gt;,

143
00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:37.873
inside of that we'll have a &lt;div&gt; with a class of bar.

144
00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:40.970
This will all make sense in just a second

145
00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:44.100
once we get into styling in the next video.

146
00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:47.360
And then inside of that let's just have an anchor link,

147
00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:51.447
sick fits, below that we'll have a &lt;div&gt;

148
00:06:51.447 --> 00:06:55.913
with a class of sub bar, sub sub, sub bar.

149
00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:01.033
And inside of that just a paragraph, just say search.

150
00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:05.630
And then we'll have another &lt;div&gt; that says cart.

151
00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:08.920
We'll go back and actually fill these out with what we want

152
00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:12.030
but we just know that this is our header,

153
00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:15.230
oh export default header.

154
00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:17.130
Then we'll go back into our page component

155
00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:21.927
and import the header from components header,

156
00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:25.170
and then we can just stick that header in here.

157
00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.090
See that we've got, regardless of what page we have,

158
00:07:32.090 --> 00:07:33.040
it's showing up.

159
00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:35.870
We'll probably also do that with a nav component.

160
00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:40.520
Let's go into components, create a nav.js.

161
00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:44.173
Nav is equal to a stateless functional component.

162
00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:47.180
Just give yourself a &lt;div&gt;, we're gonna come

163
00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:50.460
and swap these out with stock components in the next video

164
00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:55.460
and let's just inside of there import link from next/link,

165
00:07:57.890 --> 00:08:01.060
and inside of there let's give ourselves a link,

166
00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:04.400
which actually let's just grab 'em from here.

167
00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:06.010
We don't need them on each page now

168
00:08:06.010 --> 00:08:07.310
because we're gonna have them in that.

169
00:08:07.310 --> 00:08:09.540
So remove it from the index.js

170
00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:10.903
and put it into your nav.

171
00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:16.253
And remove it from your sell.js.

172
00:08:21.630 --> 00:08:22.613
Put it in your nav.

173
00:08:24.470 --> 00:08:26.520
Then we'll go into our header.js

174
00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:30.070
and import the nav from the sibling file.

175
00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:32.280
Again we don't need to directly import that

176
00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:35.690
into page.js unless you wanted it to be a sibling of header.

177
00:08:35.690 --> 00:08:38.640
You can just import it from header.js

178
00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:41.600
and then go ahead and use it.

179
00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:44.979
And right below the link we'll give ourselves a nav tag,

180
00:08:44.979 --> 00:08:47.730
and oh got a little error.

181
00:08:47.730 --> 00:08:49.620
This is one thing I really like about Next.js

182
00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:51.100
and Create React app does this as well.

183
00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:53.330
It gives you the errors directly inside of it

184
00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:55.930
so you don't actually have to go rooting around

185
00:08:55.930 --> 00:08:56.780
inside of here.

186
00:08:56.780 --> 00:09:00.040
It says, "export default imported as nav was not found."

187
00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:01.380
Back in our nav, oops!

188
00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:03.248
Export default nav.

189
00:09:03.248 --> 00:09:05.280
We forgot to export that thing.

190
00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:06.650
There we go.

191
00:09:06.650 --> 00:09:09.440
And obviously home, style home, style our nav

192
00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:11.830
is on every single page that we need it.

193
00:09:11.830 --> 00:09:13.300
So that's our nav, that's our header.

194
00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:15.470
One other component that we're going to need

195
00:09:15.470 --> 00:09:19.780
is called a meta, a meta component.

196
00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:23.300
And that's going to take care of all of the meta tags

197
00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:25.859
that you would normally see in an html document.

198
00:09:25.859 --> 00:09:30.410
So, you're title tag, any external css

199
00:09:30.410 --> 00:09:31.980
that you need to roll in,

200
00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:35.350
any Facebook meta tags, Twitter meta tag, open graft,

201
00:09:35.350 --> 00:09:37.210
all the things that you would normally

202
00:09:37.210 --> 00:09:41.160
put in the head tag of an html document.

203
00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:42.800
So we're going to go into components,

204
00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:45.050
we're gonna capital m Meta.js

205
00:09:45.890 --> 00:09:50.890
and up here we're going to import head from next/head.

206
00:09:53.211 --> 00:09:58.077
Next.js does some tricky, tricky stuff behind the scenes

207
00:09:58.077 --> 00:10:00.990
in order to actually update the head of it.

208
00:10:00.990 --> 00:10:03.350
So we need to import their custom head

209
00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:05.990
and that will do the side effect behind the scenes.

210
00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:10.990
Say const Meta is equal to a stateless functional component.

211
00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:13.960
You notice that we're using a lot of these

212
00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:15.990
stateless functional components in this course

213
00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:20.080
because a lot of the state and lifecycle methods

214
00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:23.740
are going to be handled in some of the other

215
00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:24.637
sort of high order components,

216
00:10:24.637 --> 00:10:26.220
and we'll get much into that.

217
00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:28.490
These ones are just display components.

218
00:10:28.490 --> 00:10:30.980
Export default Meta,

219
00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:33.170
and inside of that we'll put all of our Meta tags.

220
00:10:33.170 --> 00:10:34.820
I'm just gonna go ahead and copy this,

221
00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:38.240
feel free to grab this from the finished files Meta.js.

222
00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:39.270
I'm gonna paste it in here.

223
00:10:39.270 --> 00:10:40.480
So this is a view port.

224
00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:42.950
This allows us to have responsive design.

225
00:10:42.950 --> 00:10:45.048
This makes sure that we're using utf eight

226
00:10:45.048 --> 00:10:47.957
because that's the character incoding that we're using.

227
00:10:47.957 --> 00:10:52.130
This is for the fap icon that lives in the static directory.

228
00:10:52.130 --> 00:10:54.690
If you open up static you're gonna see inside of here

229
00:10:54.690 --> 00:10:58.630
we have our fap icon as well as some external css

230
00:10:58.630 --> 00:10:59.463
that we're loading in.

231
00:10:59.463 --> 00:11:01.459
I'll talk about that in just a second.

232
00:11:01.459 --> 00:11:04.140
That's why we are loading it in here

233
00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:06.850
and we are loading in nprogress.css.

234
00:11:06.850 --> 00:11:09.663
That nprogress is that cool little red bar

235
00:11:09.663 --> 00:11:11.220
that you see across the top here.

236
00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:12.800
You probably see that on a lot of websites

237
00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:13.840
that are built in React.

238
00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:16.010
And then finally, you have a title tag,

239
00:11:16.010 --> 00:11:18.330
which we are going to overwrite.

240
00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:21.820
So you see here it says Sick Fits page one of two.

241
00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:23.949
Right click through to this one.

242
00:11:23.949 --> 00:11:26.770
It'll say nice 270s so this will be our default,

243
00:11:26.770 --> 00:11:29.620
which says Sick Fits, and then anytime we wanna overwrite

244
00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:31.330
that I'm going to show you how to do that

245
00:11:31.330 --> 00:11:32.978
from within a component where you can sort of

246
00:11:32.978 --> 00:11:37.460
reach outside and update the head as a side effect.

247
00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:38.940
So you have that there.

248
00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:43.940
Let's go back into our page.js and import the Meta.

249
00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:47.590
Just above the header we're gonna give ourselves

250
00:11:47.590 --> 00:11:50.900
our Meta component and that should,

251
00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:52.363
see if we've got any errors.

252
00:11:53.410 --> 00:11:54.800
Seems like it's working.

253
00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:56.860
Give it a page refresh.

254
00:11:56.860 --> 00:11:58.240
See that we've got, there we go,

255
00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:01.190
see we've got our view port being pulled in,

256
00:12:01.190 --> 00:12:05.690
our character set, fab icon is being pulled in,

257
00:12:05.690 --> 00:12:08.970
you should see it showing up in your browser tab there.

258
00:12:08.970 --> 00:12:10.860
So, that's just a whole bunch of boiler plate

259
00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:12.870
that we need to sort of get out of the way

260
00:12:12.870 --> 00:12:16.190
in order to start actually building our application.

261
00:12:16.190 --> 00:12:18.619
In the next video we're going to dive into

262
00:12:18.619 --> 00:12:22.139
writing some styles and scaffolding out the actual look

263
00:12:22.139 --> 00:12:24.273
and feel of this application.
