00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:04.010
<v Instructor>So now we have all of our permissions</v>

2
00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:05.100
up and running.

3
00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:06.330
There's still one more thing,

4
00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.380
which is like when you sign out,

5
00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:10.850
let's go to the Sell page here and copy that year out.

6
00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:14.030
When you sign out and you still go to the Sell page,

7
00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:16.520
you still see this UI for creating something.

8
00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:19.460
And it won't work because we've implemented the rules,

9
00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:21.730
but it might be confusing to our users

10
00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:24.890
to see the fact that someone sent them this year around

11
00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:26.190
and they start to upload their thing

12
00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:28.020
and they're like, ah, you don't have access to do that.

13
00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:30.790
So we should not even show them this UI at all.

14
00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:33.930
So for that, let's head back to our front end here

15
00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.910
and we'll go to our Components Director,

16
00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.520 line:15% 
and we're gonna make a gated sign-in component,

17
00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.110 line:15% 
which basically will render out the sign-in component

18
00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:44.270 line:15% 
if the user is not signed in first.

19
00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:47.300 line:15% 
So what we'll do is go to our components, make a new file.

20
00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.330 line:15% 
We will call that PleaseSignIn.js,

21
00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:53.913 line:15% 
capital P, capital S, capital I,

22
00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:00.110
and we'll make a function, export default function.

23
00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.680
That function will take in children,

24
00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.860
'cause this is going to wrap components.

25
00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.950
And then we will say, me is equal to useUser.

26
00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.710
We'll import that hook ourselves.

27
00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:16.710
So useUser, no, it's not working,

28
00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.650
so import useUser from user.

29
00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.430
And basically, we say if there is no me,

30
00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:31.953
so if I'm not signed in, we return our SignIn component.

31
00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:38.927
So import SignIn from SignIn.

32
00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:50.500
And if they are signed in, we'll just return the children.

33
00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.860
And what that will do is just render out what we had hoped.

34
00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.380
So I'm in a logged out state right now on the Sell page.

35
00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.650
What we'll do is we'll go to the Sell page

36
00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:01.700
and we'll wrap that create product

37
00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.800
in a PleaseSignIn component,

38
00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:06.850
put it in the middle.

39
00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:09.350
And now, look at that.

40
00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:11.200
If somebody is not signed in,

41
00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.230
then it will just say, Sign Into Your Account.

42
00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.920
And the kind of cool thing is that

43
00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.730
you can just sign into it right here,

44
00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.783
test@example.com, test,

45
00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:25.360
and sign in.

46
00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.080
And because when you sign in, we refetch the query,

47
00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.400
it'll just rerender this component

48
00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.380
with the actual component that you were hoping to get,

49
00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:36.560
which is create product, which is really, really awesome.

50
00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.340
So there's a couple of spots

51
00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.060
throughout the entire application

52
00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.930
that you can wrap your components in this PleaseSignIn.

53
00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.390
You could also make another one where

54
00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:50.030
instead of it returning this, it returns nothing

55
00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.890
and things like the Buy button or the Delete button

56
00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:54.680
could just not be rendered at all.

57
00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.490
I'll let you go ahead and add that

58
00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:58.600
if it's something you'd like to add to your thing.

59
00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:59.980
The only difference would just be

60
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.160
you just return null instead of an actual component,

61
00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.040
and then it would just, it would render out nothing,

62
00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.873
which is great.

63
00:03:07.873 --> 00:03:10.960
So it's a kind of a cool way to just wrap a component.

64
00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:12.610
It's sort of like a if statement.
