00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:03.350
<v Instructor>Next couple of videos we gonna be,</v>

2
00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:06.010
creating the single order page to display what is

3
00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:08.160
in the order and the total and all that good stuff.

4
00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.010
And then also there should be a page that lists all

5
00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:12.720
of these orders.

6
00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:14.350
And I'd like to encourage you to try

7
00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:15.547
and do those yourselves,

8
00:00:15.547 --> 00:00:17.540
*cause this is pretty simple stuff.

9
00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:19.940
You're just gonna query the data, loop over it,

10
00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:22.370
display it on the page, maybe a couple

11
00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:25.180
of links to different pages and you're good to go.

12
00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:30.180
So we need to do this page /order/ the ID.

13
00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:32.284
So in order to do that,

14
00:00:32.284 --> 00:00:33.117
(laughs loudly)

15
00:00:33.117 --> 00:00:34.170
in order to do that,

16
00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.510
you know that's good,

17
00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:37.890
we're going to need an order folder.

18
00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.680
So new folder, order and then inside of that,

19
00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:46.343
we'll need a square [Id].js file.

20
00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.270
And that should catch this specific route.

21
00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.270
In there, we'll export default function order page

22
00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:59.233
or may be a single order page, we'll call it.

23
00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:04.343
And from that return a div, that says, hey.

24
00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:08.160
Now if you refresh this page, here we go.

25
00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.640
Now we see, hey, showing up on that page.

26
00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.530
Good, so first thing we wanna do is,

27
00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:19.480
we actually need to query the ID of the order.

28
00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:21.640
And I believe that comes in via props.

29
00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.560
Let's console.log the props

30
00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.360
to see what we're working with here.

31
00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:28.430
Here we go, query, ID.

32
00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:32.783
So we can destructure query here.

33
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:40.200
And let's just try put the ID into this div that we have,

34
00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.730
query.id, here we go.

35
00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:44.650
So the ID of that order is being passed.

36
00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:46.860
And if you don't have this page open, you can just go

37
00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.830
to your orders and grab an ID from any one of these orders.

38
00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:53.210
We haven't done permissions or anything.

39
00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:54.230
So it doesn't even matter

40
00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:56.343
if it's associated with the user or not.

41
00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.240
Next up we'll make a query.

42
00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.087
So const single order query,.

43
00:02:08.854 --> 00:02:09.687
GQL got it.

44
00:02:09.687 --> 00:02:14.140
Import GQL.Always do it twice.

45
00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:15.770
There we go.

46
00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:20.770
Now inside of here, make a query called single order query

47
00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.203
It takes in an ID with the type of ID.

48
00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.910
And then in there we use our Keystone query

49
00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:30.383
which we'll go here.

50
00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:35.830
Well, we'll do a query, just is order, right?

51
00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:37.760
We just want one specific order.

52
00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.510
So it is capital order.

53
00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:41.770
I don't like the fact that

54
00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:43.440
it comes back with a capital on it

55
00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.100
So in our case, we could just rename that to lowercase order

56
00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:47.270
like that.

57
00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:50.340
And then for the order, we need to say, give me

58
00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:55.340
a specific order where the ID is gonna be equal

59
00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:59.600
to the ID variable that's passed in to this query.

60
00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:02.830
Then for each order, we wanna grab the ID of that order

61
00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:06.350
the charge, the total, the user, that order

62
00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:10.120
is associated with, the items that are in that order,

63
00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.750
and then for each item, we want the ID of that item

64
00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.543
the name, the description,

65
00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.083
the price,

66
00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:23.223
the photo image,

67
00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:30.363
and the public URL transformed,

68
00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:36.100
and then finally, also quantity of how many did they buy

69
00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:38.470
of that thing, all right?

70
00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:40.870
And we'll go down here and write a little query.

71
00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:44.550
So const data

72
00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:47.380
And I donno

73
00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:52.370
we just destructure like this data error and loading

74
00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:56.010
Sequel to use query

75
00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:00.430
Pass it or a single order query.

76
00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:01.630
And then the variables

77
00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:07.333
are going to be ID, which is queried ID.

78
00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:13.790
All right, then inside of here, I could say

79
00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:18.170
if we are loading return P loading

80
00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:24.080
if there is an error, then return our error message

81
00:04:33.922 --> 00:04:38.120
Got to import that at the top, import error message

82
00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:41.773
from go up a level into components.

83
00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:46.610
Oh, we got to go up two levels, that's why,

84
00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:51.300
then components and then into error message.

85
00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:54.883
Okay. And then you pass that error here.

86
00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:59.670
This will be helpful when we get into permissions,

87
00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:02.590
if someone's trynna view an order that is legitimate

88
00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:05.647
but they're not allowed, then we will tell them,

89
00:05:05.647 --> 00:05:08.210
"Hey buddy, you're not allowed to see this order."

90
00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:09.943
what are you snooping for?

91
00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:14.710
All right,now, next, what we wanna do is to

92
00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:17.700
destructure the order from that.

93
00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:19.320
So const order is equal

94
00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:22.060
to data that will take the data.order property

95
00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:24.110
and put it into its own value.

96
00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:27.530
And then I believe we should be able to do things

97
00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:29.140
like order.ID.

98
00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:32.653
And if we save that nothing changes. It worked.

99
00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:35.980
But we should be also seeing something like total.

100
00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:39.620
Here we go ordered.charge

101
00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:41.750
Here we go.

102
00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:42.583
Good, good, good.

103
00:05:42.583 --> 00:05:44.020
So now we can start to

104
00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:48.340
kinda render out a bunch

105
00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:50.780
of the data that we wanna show on the page here.

106
00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:54.230
So let's just scare it, all this.

107
00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:56.610
We need order styles

108
00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:00.580
Try to auto import that and all that

109
00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:02.090
one's not working.

110
00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:06.080
So we'll import it at the top import order styles from

111
00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:12.510
up to levels, into our components folder

112
00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:17.213
into styles, directory, and then order styles.

113
00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:31.800
And inside of that, let's use our head so we can do the SEO.

114
00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:35.410
So we'll import head from next head.

115
00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:40.323
What are the top import head from next head.

116
00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:45.410
And then in here, we could simply just say title

117
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.180
is equal to sick fits

118
00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:54.113
and we'll say, ordered.ID.

119
00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:57.040
Here we go, now we've got, now we have some

120
00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:58.830
a nice title bar showing up there

121
00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:02.320
below that we need a paragraph,

122
00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:05.660
what they span says, order ID

123
00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:11.520
and then another span that has the order.ID.

124
00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:20.917
Good. Let's duplicate that and say, charge

125
00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:28.460
Good. We're basically just gonna be rendering

126
00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:31.360
out all the data that is in that one.

127
00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:33.050
We'll do another one.Say,

128
00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:37.090
order total is ordered.total

129
00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:41.433
and we can wrap that in a format, money function.

130
00:07:45.010 --> 00:07:46.703
Obviously we gotta import it.

131
00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:50.590
Come on VS code

132
00:07:50.590 --> 00:07:53.090
Sometimes the import doesn't work.

133
00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:53.923
I'm not sure why.

134
00:07:53.923 --> 00:07:56.890
Maybe it has something to do with the fact that

135
00:07:56.890 --> 00:08:00.180
this file has square brackets in the name I donno

136
00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:05.180
import format money from lib format money.

137
00:08:07.690 --> 00:08:08.523
There we go.

138
00:08:09.627 --> 00:08:10.460
$34

139
00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:17.323
and then we'll do another one that says item count.

140
00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:23.710
I'll say, order.items.length

141
00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:28.450
Good. Just so there's one item in that.

142
00:08:28.450 --> 00:08:32.120
And then we'll give itself the div with a class of items

143
00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:36.160
and we'll take the ordered.items and map over it.

144
00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:39.033
Ordered.items.map.

145
00:08:39.970 --> 00:08:40.953
We got the item.

146
00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:45.490
And then for each one, we'll return a div with a class

147
00:08:45.490 --> 00:08:47.370
of order-item.

148
00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:51.223
We also need a key of the item.ID on there,

149
00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:57.920
You source an image where the source is

150
00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:03.333
the item.photo.image.public

151
00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:07.450
You're all transformed.

152
00:09:07.450 --> 00:09:10.418
I am so excited not to ever have to type that again.

153
00:09:10.418 --> 00:09:11.251
(laughs loudly)

154
00:09:11.251 --> 00:09:14.010
That's the worst, worst name for that.

155
00:09:14.010 --> 00:09:17.043
And then we can say item.title.

156
00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:20.150
There we go

157
00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:22.593
Looking good of H2 tag.

158
00:09:23.690 --> 00:09:26.900
Oh no, We need a div with a class of item details.

159
00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:30.490
And then H2 tag inside of there as item.name

160
00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:38.633
paragraph tag item.quantity,

161
00:09:42.263 --> 00:09:46.933
qty could duplicate it.

162
00:09:48.250 --> 00:09:49.083
Each

163
00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:56.630
is a format money and

164
00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:01.993
is item.price.

165
00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:05.360
Let's say sub total

166
00:10:11.770 --> 00:10:15.340
Which is the item.price times the item.quantity

167
00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:18.753
there we go.

168
00:10:18.753 --> 00:10:19.586
Looking good.

169
00:10:19.586 --> 00:10:22.430
And then finally, a paragraph tag

170
00:10:22.430 --> 00:10:24.483
with the item.description in it.

171
00:10:29.450 --> 00:10:31.120
Boom, that's looking pretty good.

172
00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:33.620
Let's try, switch out the ID with one that has more

173
00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:37.250
than one item like this one has lots of items.

174
00:10:37.250 --> 00:10:40.343
So I'm just gonna grab the ID here, switch it out.

175
00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:43.133
Here we go

176
00:10:43.133 --> 00:10:46.490
That's looking pretty slick, pretty, pretty slick.

177
00:10:46.490 --> 00:10:49.300
So that's enough for that one single order in the next one

178
00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:52.050
we will move over to displaying all

179
00:10:52.050 --> 00:10:55.100
of the orders on one page that you can click through

180
00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:56.563
and visit one of these.
