00:00:01.211 --> 00:00:02.044
<v ->In this video,</v>

3
00:00:02.044 --> 00:00:04.200
we're gonna be doing the add to cart functionality.

4
00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:05.700
And this is actually where we're going to get

5
00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.620
into writing custom mutations,

6
00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.860
because, in order to create a cart item,

7
00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:12.200
we have an API for that.

8
00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.330
If we go to our GraphQL API Explorer here,

9
00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.963
we could write a mutation that is called createCartItem,

10
00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:25.110
and then we would give it link to both the user,

11
00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:27.760
the product and the quantity that we have.

12
00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:30.430
The issue that we run into here is that,

13
00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:32.510
if you add an item to your cart

14
00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:35.230
and then you add that same item to your cart again,

15
00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:37.700
it shouldn't create two separate cart items.

16
00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:39.940
It should just update the existing one

17
00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.250
to have a quantity of one more.

18
00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:44.620
And that type of custom logic that we need,

19
00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:47.760
needs to go into a custom mutation.

20
00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:48.860
And this is really great

21
00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:52.010
because, if you have some sort of code

22
00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:57.010
that needs to go past what the default is in Keystone,

23
00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:00.310
you can just add your own mutation resolvers,

24
00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:01.680
which is really cool.

25
00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.080
So, what we're gonna do is,

26
00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.830
we'll open up our keystone.ts on our backend.

27
00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:09.110
And there is a property

28
00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.550
on this list here called extendGraphQLSchema.

29
00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:16.670
So, basically take the existingGraphQLSchema,

30
00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:18.230
take all of this stuff

31
00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:20.430
and then add in either my own queries,

32
00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.290
my own types or my own methods.

33
00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:25.730
So, we will go down here actually,

34
00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:27.280
and we got to create it first.

35
00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.960
So, we're gonna go into our mutations folder

36
00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.723
and I'll make a new file called index.ts.

37
00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:37.610
And then in here,

38
00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:39.930
we will export const extendGraphQLSchema

39
00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.580
is equal to graphQLSchemaExtension.

40
00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:57.253
That is a method that is imported from Keystone.

41
00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:59.820
And then inside of there,

42
00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.510
we have typedefs

43
00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:07.330
and we will have a secondary, we'll have resolvers.

44
00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.760
So, type definitions are exactly this.

45
00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:11.960
If you take a look here,

46
00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:16.210
the type definition is what is the name of the method?

47
00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:18.070
What arguments does it take?

48
00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:19.840
And what does it return?

49
00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.070
And then the resolvers,

50
00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:24.360
is just links to no jazz functions that will run

51
00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.410
when those things are requested upon

52
00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:29.000
via the GraphQL API.

53
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.160
So, we have that in that,

54
00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:31.390
let's do typedefs first.

55
00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:35.320
So, typedefs is just going to be a string

56
00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:36.800
that is some GraphQL.

57
00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:41.800
So, we'll say type mutation and some curly brackets.

58
00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:43.690
And the first one that we are going to do,

59
00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:45.100
we will have two in this course,

60
00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.220
we have addToCart and checkout.

61
00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.040
So, we'll do addToCart first,

62
00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.300
addToCart when we're adding an item,

63
00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:54.810
it takes in a productId

64
00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.960
which has a type of Id,

65
00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:00.040
and then it will return a CartItem.

66
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.150
Now like, why is this green like this?

67
00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.990
It's kind of annoying.

68
00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:07.990
Normally, what we do is we type like GQL or GraphQL

69
00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.650
and we get this really nice highlighting,

70
00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:16.120
but in our case we just need to give it a raw string.

71
00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:17.580
So, that's kind of annoying,

72
00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:21.920
because, we don't get the really nice syntax highlighting.

73
00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.650
So, I'm gonna show you a little bit of a hack,

74
00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:29.250
because, VS Code will highlight things

75
00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:32.810
tagged with GQL or GraphQL.

76
00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:36.420
We can actually make our own little fake syntax highlighter.

77
00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:37.410
So, here we go,

78
00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:40.630
make a fake GQL,

79
00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:42.043
or what's called GraphQL,

80
00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:46.350
tagged template literal.

81
00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:48.840
So, it's just this const GraphQL

82
00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.150
is equal to capital S String.raw.

83
00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:57.150
And String.raw will take in a tag template literal,

84
00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:58.490
which are these back ticks

85
00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:01.870
and just return the text that's inside the quotes.

86
00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:03.250
So, very, very simple.

87
00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:04.083
And then watch this.

88
00:04:04.083 --> 00:04:05.930
Now we can say GraphQL

89
00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:09.350
and we get these really nice syntax highlighting.

90
00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:10.890
We've got a little bit of red here

91
00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:13.630
and that is because property resolvers is missing.

92
00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:15.800
Good, okay, well, we can do that next.

93
00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:16.920
So, underneath here,

94
00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:19.000
we'll say resolvers

95
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.000
and that will be a mutation underneath there.

96
00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:26.800
And then for each one,

97
00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:31.370
we'll say, addToCart will be a function.

98
00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:36.190
And then the custom code goes here.

99
00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:39.373
So, let's just console.log ADD TO CART.

100
00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:42.410
So, let's go back here.

101
00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:46.663
We got to kill our backend and start it up again.

102
00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:49.930
And once that's done,

103
00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:52.570
refresh your GraphQL Explorer.

104
00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:53.900
And now that this is loaded,

105
00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:55.520
we can take a look at our schema

106
00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.650
and owner our schema at docs

107
00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:00.760
and we should see, add to no, not in there.

108
00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:03.130
Okay, why?

109
00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:04.070
We wrote all this code,

110
00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:06.940
but we actually forgot to tell Keystone about it.

111
00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:10.220
So, we need to go back to our Keystone

112
00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:13.100
and embed it right here

113
00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:17.370
amongst all of the config options of Keystone.

114
00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:18.500
So, what did we call that?

115
00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:20.200
It was called extendGraphQLSchema.

116
00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:23.680
The reason why we called it that,

117
00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:26.823
is because the property is called extendGraphQLSchema.

118
00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:31.370
And then the variable is gonna be also be called that.

119
00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:34.710
Let's go and import that from our index.

120
00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:36.730
And then it just makes a property value

121
00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:38.040
that is exactly the same.

122
00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:39.703
Now, if we restart it,

123
00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:45.610
our schema should have access to that add to area,

124
00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:46.750
look at this.

125
00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:49.900
So, now we have our custom mutation addToCart.

126
00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:51.767
It takes in a productId

127
00:05:51.767 --> 00:05:54.480
with a type of Id and returns a CartItem.

128
00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:55.460
And then it knows,

129
00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:58.230
because we already have a type of CartItem

130
00:05:58.230 --> 00:05:59.430
in our GraphQL schema.

131
00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:02.140
It already knows that addToCart item has an Id,

132
00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:04.830
a quantity and a link to product and a user.

133
00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:06.230
See how beautiful that is,

134
00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:09.917
to be able to make your own custom resolvers.

135
00:06:09.917 --> 00:06:11.780
And you can just go ahead and do that.

136
00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:16.060
Now, I like to code the stuff behind these customers solvers

137
00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:17.593
in their own file,

138
00:06:17.593 --> 00:06:19.500
each mutation in its own file,

139
00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:21.980
cause they can get rather large.

140
00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:22.900
So, what we'll do is,

141
00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:24.900
we'll go into our mutations folder here,

142
00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:27.510
make a new file called addToCart

143
00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:30.243
capital T capital C dot ts.

144
00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:36.700
And we'll export default function, addToCart.

145
00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:42.220
And that takes a couple arguments.

146
00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:46.059
First one is a route, which has a type of any.

147
00:06:46.059 --> 00:06:50.453
Then we also do structure the productId

148
00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:56.280
which is going to be a String.

149
00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:57.750
So, I'll just type it right here.

150
00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:01.803
The productId is going to have a type of String.

151
00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:05.810
And then we have context

152
00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:09.133
and that is gonna have a type of KeystoneContext.

153
00:07:10.379 --> 00:07:11.530
We'll have to import that,

154
00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:15.263
boom that auto imports from Keystone next types.

155
00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:20.300
Now, we have to open our function here

156
00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:24.403
and we'll say console.log, ADDING TO CART.

157
00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:30.840
Then we can go here

158
00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:32.573
and just remove this method.

159
00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:37.503
And auto import that function.

160
00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:44.343
It's not importing function addToCart if we do this.

161
00:07:47.815 --> 00:07:49.898
Export default addToCart.

162
00:07:51.953 --> 00:07:54.175
I bet if we do it like that,

163
00:07:54.175 --> 00:07:55.960
it will auto import.

164
00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:59.060
Nope, all right, that's okay,

165
00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:00.340
we'll import it.

166
00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:05.147
Import addToCart from addToCart.

167
00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:10.850
Okay, so we have our mutation addToCart,

168
00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:11.730
when that runs,

169
00:08:11.730 --> 00:08:15.830
it will run this function right here.

170
00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:17.950
So, if we get again we've got to kill

171
00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:19.360
and restart the process

172
00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:21.323
anytime we make changes to this.

173
00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:23.910
But when we do run that,

174
00:08:23.910 --> 00:08:27.870
we should be able to code up our own mutation here.

175
00:08:27.870 --> 00:08:32.050
So, mutation addToCart,

176
00:08:32.050 --> 00:08:36.150
takes in a productId of abc123,

177
00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:41.150
and will return the Id, the quantity, all that good stuff.

178
00:08:41.170 --> 00:08:43.270
So, it will probably error out

179
00:08:43.270 --> 00:08:45.610
because we're not actually returning a value,

180
00:08:45.610 --> 00:08:47.804
but it should at least say,

181
00:08:47.804 --> 00:08:50.200
ADDING TO CART in the console here.

182
00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:52.263
So, I'll clear out my console, run it,

183
00:08:53.245 --> 00:08:54.850
boom, ADDING TO CART.

184
00:08:54.850 --> 00:08:57.990
It returns null cause that value doesn't return anything,

185
00:08:57.990 --> 00:09:00.200
but we are in good shape.

186
00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:02.210
We can also do a little bit of TypeScript typing

187
00:09:02.210 --> 00:09:03.043
to say that,

188
00:09:03.043 --> 00:09:07.030
okay this function we've typed the things that it takes in,

189
00:09:07.030 --> 00:09:10.013
but also you need to type what it's returning, right?

190
00:09:10.013 --> 00:09:12.270
And we already know

191
00:09:12.270 --> 00:09:15.890
that it's returning a cart item right here.

192
00:09:15.890 --> 00:09:17.340
And luckily for us,

193
00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:20.580
Keystone generates all the types based on our schemas.

194
00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:22.110
So, we can say here,

195
00:09:22.110 --> 00:09:23.923
it will return a CartItem.

196
00:09:25.210 --> 00:09:27.560
And I believe it is create input.

197
00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:30.953
You see when that auto imported itself,

198
00:09:31.852 --> 00:09:33.252
it says CartItemCreateInput.

199
00:09:35.090 --> 00:09:37.450
You see that it links off to the schema types.

200
00:09:37.450 --> 00:09:38.440
And if you click through to that,

201
00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:42.514
you can see there's tons and tons of types in here

202
00:09:42.514 --> 00:09:44.760
that describe everything is in there.

203
00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:48.340
And there's not just like a regular CartItem,

204
00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:50.570
but there is CartItemCreateInput,

205
00:09:50.570 --> 00:09:52.270
which has the quantity

206
00:09:52.270 --> 00:09:54.565
which is an Integer or nothing.

207
00:09:54.565 --> 00:09:57.010
And then links to products and users

208
00:09:57.010 --> 00:09:59.840
which could be associated content.

209
00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:01.640
So, that one will work for us.

210
00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:02.473
The other thing is,

211
00:10:02.473 --> 00:10:04.290
is that this is we're gonna be using

212
00:10:04.290 --> 00:10:06.730
a little bit of sync await inside of this.

213
00:10:06.730 --> 00:10:10.110
So, this needs to be marked as a sync.

214
00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:12.157
And the return value is not a CardItem.

215
00:10:12.157 --> 00:10:14.483
The return value is a promise,

216
00:10:15.730 --> 00:10:18.250
and then this is a promise

217
00:10:18.250 --> 00:10:21.456
that will eventually return a CartItem.

218
00:10:21.456 --> 00:10:22.860
So, wow!, now inside of here,

219
00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:24.230
we need to do I think five things.

220
00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:25.410
Let's write a little bit of pseudo code.

221
00:10:25.410 --> 00:10:27.410
First, we need to query the current user

222
00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:29.770
and see if they're signed in.

223
00:10:33.870 --> 00:10:38.870
Second, we need to query the current users cart.

224
00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:45.140
Three, we need to see if the item that they're adding

225
00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:46.541
is already in their cart,

226
00:10:46.541 --> 00:10:47.383
because if it is,

227
00:10:47.383 --> 00:10:49.420
then we have to just increment it by one.

228
00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:50.357
And if it isn't,

229
00:10:50.357 --> 00:10:51.570
we have to create a whole new cart item.

230
00:10:51.570 --> 00:10:55.910
So three, see if the current item

231
00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:59.090
is in the cart.

232
00:10:59.090 --> 00:11:02.570
Four, and maybe in depth this one,

233
00:11:02.570 --> 00:11:05.650
if it is increment by one,

234
00:11:05.650 --> 00:11:08.723
and if it isn't,

235
00:11:10.270 --> 00:11:12.043
create a new CartItem.

236
00:11:14.890 --> 00:11:17.380
All right, so, first thing,

237
00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:19.390
query the current user and see if they're signed in.

238
00:11:19.390 --> 00:11:21.600
So, how do you tell if somebody is signed in?

239
00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:23.290
Well, we got this context right here

240
00:11:23.290 --> 00:11:26.590
and on that context, you've got context dot,

241
00:11:26.590 --> 00:11:28.711
you can see on the context they give is,

242
00:11:28.711 --> 00:11:30.830
they give you GraphQL.

243
00:11:30.830 --> 00:11:34.360
They give you actually the instance of your Keystone,

244
00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:36.050
a whole bunch of different methods

245
00:11:36.050 --> 00:11:38.180
and all the lists that you have.

246
00:11:38.180 --> 00:11:41.100
But one thing that they give you is the session.

247
00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:42.140
So, I'll make a new variable,

248
00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:45.513
say const sesh is equal to context.session.

249
00:11:46.750 --> 00:11:51.430
And for some reason it is typing it as any.

250
00:11:51.430 --> 00:11:52.950
So, in this case,

251
00:11:52.950 --> 00:11:54.540
I'm probably just cause of Keystone types

252
00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:55.740
haven't been updated.

253
00:11:55.740 --> 00:12:00.740
But we can type it as Session, capital S Session here.

254
00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:06.713
And what that will do is it will import it from our types.

255
00:12:08.810 --> 00:12:10.910
And then if we take a look at our sesh,

256
00:12:10.910 --> 00:12:15.240
you see that the value is now being a sesh.

257
00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:18.373
So, we can say if the sesh.ItemId,

258
00:12:20.410 --> 00:12:22.690
if there is no session ItemId,

259
00:12:22.690 --> 00:12:26.310
meaning that if there is no user currently logged in,

260
00:12:26.310 --> 00:12:28.960
we'll just throw a new error,

261
00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:33.883
that says you must be logged in to do this.

262
00:12:36.510 --> 00:12:39.750
Otherwise, we're going to query the current users carts.

263
00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:44.140
Let's say, const allCartItem is equal to await

264
00:12:45.070 --> 00:12:47.210
and we'll take that context

265
00:12:47.210 --> 00:12:48.920
and we can grab the lists

266
00:12:49.970 --> 00:12:52.790
and we can grab the cart item off of that,

267
00:12:52.790 --> 00:12:54.600
and say find many.

268
00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:58.520
So, part of the beauty of being in Keystone,

269
00:12:58.520 --> 00:13:01.980
is that we can just reach directly into the lists

270
00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:06.060
and run a function that will find the items for us.

271
00:13:06.060 --> 00:13:07.960
We don't need to go to the GraphQL API,

272
00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:08.793
or anything like that.

273
00:13:08.793 --> 00:13:11.770
We can just go directly to the database,

274
00:13:11.770 --> 00:13:14.370
right from our resolvers in here.

275
00:13:14.370 --> 00:13:16.713
And we'll say find many where,

276
00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:25.480
the user Id

277
00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:27.573
is going to be equal to the sesh.ItemId.

278
00:13:36.070 --> 00:13:38.023
And where the productId

279
00:13:40.460 --> 00:13:43.977
is going to be equal to the productId.

280
00:13:45.610 --> 00:13:49.737
And that is being passed in via the arguments, right?

281
00:13:49.737 --> 00:13:52.150
That's this value right here.

282
00:13:52.150 --> 00:13:55.160
So, essentially what we're doing right here is we're saying,

283
00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:58.940
find me an item where the user

284
00:13:58.940 --> 00:14:01.680
and the product are this.

285
00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:03.840
And the reason why we're not just finding one,

286
00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:06.760
is because these fields are not unique

287
00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:09.210
and you cannot use find one

288
00:14:09.210 --> 00:14:11.860
unless all the fields that are being used are unique.

289
00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:13.650
So, here we just find an array.

290
00:14:13.650 --> 00:14:16.050
And if there is one item in that array,

291
00:14:16.050 --> 00:14:19.150
we'll know that that item is currently in their cart.

292
00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:22.990
So, we'll throw that first item into a variable.

293
00:14:22.990 --> 00:14:24.513
So, we'll restructure it,

294
00:14:25.628 --> 00:14:30.227
existingCartItem is equal to allCartItems.

295
00:14:31.644 --> 00:14:33.780
And what that does is it restructures the first item

296
00:14:33.780 --> 00:14:36.850
of that array into a variable called existingCartItem.

297
00:14:36.850 --> 00:14:40.810
And we'll say, if there is an existingCartItem,

298
00:14:40.810 --> 00:14:45.810
console.log, 'this item is already in the cart

299
00:14:46.030 --> 00:14:48.007
increment by one.'

300
00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:55.940
And we can actually interpolate

301
00:14:55.940 --> 00:14:57.470
how many items are in that cart.

302
00:14:57.470 --> 00:15:00.943
So, there are already,

303
00:15:04.577 --> 00:15:07.800
I need to use back ticks here, existingItem.quantity.

304
00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:15.283
There are already existingItems.quantity increment by one.

305
00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:17.910
And then what we'll do here from here,

306
00:15:17.910 --> 00:15:22.910
is return await context.list.CartItem.updateOne,

307
00:15:31.550 --> 00:15:36.383
where the Id is equal to the existingCartItem.Id.

308
00:15:37.730 --> 00:15:39.200
And now the data,

309
00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:42.360
is going to be updated as of quantity.

310
00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:46.600
Quantity will be quantity plus one

311
00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:53.683
and actually it's existingCartItem.quantity.

312
00:15:55.780 --> 00:15:58.200
So, you'll see there's lots of red in here

313
00:15:58.200 --> 00:16:00.520
and I'm not gonna go into all the nitty-gritty

314
00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:02.280
of all the different rules of TypeScript,

315
00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:04.810
because it's not necessarily a type trip course.

316
00:16:04.810 --> 00:16:06.390
The reason why I didn't use TypeScript in here,

317
00:16:06.390 --> 00:16:08.763
it's just that we can get really good auto completion.

318
00:16:08.763 --> 00:16:11.550
So, these aren't necessarily TypeScript errors,

319
00:16:11.550 --> 00:16:13.380
they are ESLint errors

320
00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:15.690
that could potentially be issues down the road,

321
00:16:15.690 --> 00:16:17.730
but not for what we're doing right now.

322
00:16:17.730 --> 00:16:19.290
So, if they are annoying you,

323
00:16:19.290 --> 00:16:21.190
you can just go to the top of the file

324
00:16:21.190 --> 00:16:25.563
and put a little comment that says ESLint disable.

325
00:16:27.530 --> 00:16:31.070
And that will puf!, all of your programming issues are gone.

326
00:16:31.070 --> 00:16:33.610
And obviously that's maybe not the best idea,

327
00:16:33.610 --> 00:16:37.260
but for the purpose of this course

328
00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:41.150
and not getting too nitty-gritty into TypeScript,

329
00:16:41.150 --> 00:16:43.180
I think that works just fine for what we're doing here.

330
00:16:43.180 --> 00:16:47.470
So, we are returning the new CartItem,

331
00:16:47.470 --> 00:16:49.060
because await will wait

332
00:16:49.060 --> 00:16:51.920
for the updated CartItem to come back.

333
00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:55.620
And then I guess that's number three right here.

334
00:16:55.620 --> 00:16:58.540
And then form has also number four.

335
00:16:58.540 --> 00:17:00.330
And then finally, if it isn't,

336
00:17:00.330 --> 00:17:01.420
create a new CartItem.

337
00:17:01.420 --> 00:17:06.420
So, return await context.lists.CartItem.createOne,

338
00:17:11.570 --> 00:17:14.653
Where the data is the product.

339
00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:20.380
And now we need to make relationships.

340
00:17:20.380 --> 00:17:23.450
When you are creating a relationships in a product

341
00:17:23.450 --> 00:17:24.390
it works like this.

342
00:17:24.390 --> 00:17:26.303
You say product connect,

343
00:17:29.770 --> 00:17:34.197
where the Id is equal to the productId.

344
00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:37.550
And then the user connect,

345
00:17:37.550 --> 00:17:42.286
or the Id of the user is equal to, what did we say?

346
00:17:42.286 --> 00:17:44.453
Sesh.ItemId, lowercase d.

347
00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:54.997
See how that still had the underline there,

348
00:17:54.997 --> 00:17:58.520
because it says that's actual TypeScript error.

349
00:17:58.520 --> 00:17:59.830
That's not just the linting error,

350
00:17:59.830 --> 00:18:01.030
this is a TypeScript error.

351
00:18:01.030 --> 00:18:02.320
ItemId does not exist,

352
00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:03.500
did you mean itemId?

353
00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:04.650
Oh yeah, I did.

354
00:18:04.650 --> 00:18:05.490
Thank you, TypeScript.

355
00:18:05.490 --> 00:18:07.532
That's really nice of you.

356
00:18:07.532 --> 00:18:11.307
Wow!, all right, so, we just wrote all that code,

357
00:18:11.307 --> 00:18:13.050
but we didn't test it yet.

358
00:18:13.050 --> 00:18:18.050
Let's go and you got to kill the build and restart it.

359
00:18:18.770 --> 00:18:23.770
And now when we try to add it with a product that exists,

360
00:18:24.740 --> 00:18:26.560
go to our products,

361
00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:28.893
I'm gonna grab the cooler.

362
00:18:29.870 --> 00:18:32.000
I'm gonna grab the Id here

363
00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.040
and then let's just try and run it.

364
00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:37.840
And when we run it, error.

365
00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:41.070
Okay, so we've got a bit of an error the first time.

366
00:18:41.070 --> 00:18:44.260
They're already undefined increment by one.

367
00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:49.260
Okay, I bet there is an issue

368
00:18:54.410 --> 00:18:55.680
with the allCartItems.

369
00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:57.170
So, let's debug this a little bit.

370
00:18:57.170 --> 00:19:00.277
Will console.log, all cart item.

371
00:19:00.277 --> 00:19:03.430
And we'll see what items it finds here.

372
00:19:03.430 --> 00:19:07.970
So, restart, I'm gonna clear up my console,

373
00:19:07.970 --> 00:19:08.963
run it again.

374
00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:11.260
And here we go.

375
00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:15.073
So, this is the CartItems for that item.

376
00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:19.610
And it's returning three items,

377
00:19:19.610 --> 00:19:21.620
which means there's three items in our cart.

378
00:19:21.620 --> 00:19:24.160
This should only be returning one item,

379
00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:27.040
because there should be only one product

380
00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:28.430
that matches it.

381
00:19:28.430 --> 00:19:32.400
So, I'm wondering if the productId

382
00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:35.470
is not being passed in properly.

383
00:19:35.470 --> 00:19:39.311
So, we'll go ahead and console log the productId as well.

384
00:19:39.311 --> 00:19:42.140
Unfortunately this debugging is a little bit slow,

385
00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:45.050
cause you got to kill the process and start it again.

386
00:19:45.050 --> 00:19:46.970
But, bear with me here.

387
00:19:46.970 --> 00:19:49.603
I'm gonna clear up my console, run it again.

388
00:19:51.150 --> 00:19:52.650
And yeah, we get undefined.

389
00:19:52.650 --> 00:19:55.860
Okay, so, Oh, look at this.

390
00:19:55.860 --> 00:20:00.860
I bet it's because, did I type it as product capital ID?

391
00:20:00.950 --> 00:20:04.560
I did, that's my problem.

392
00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:05.860
So, we'll go back to our index

393
00:20:05.860 --> 00:20:08.300
you see how I did capital ID here.

394
00:20:08.300 --> 00:20:10.230
I always do this and it shouldn't be.

395
00:20:10.230 --> 00:20:12.540
Identification is not two words,

396
00:20:12.540 --> 00:20:15.600
so it should be lowercase d on that.

397
00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:18.593
And then same thing when I pass the Id here.

398
00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:22.020
And then when it is being restructured

399
00:20:22.020 --> 00:20:25.260
in our addToCart function,

400
00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:26.250
it's just right here.

401
00:20:26.250 --> 00:20:27.730
That's where we did it properly.

402
00:20:27.730 --> 00:20:29.300
So, a little bit of a goof up there.

403
00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:31.963
So, I bet this will now run.

404
00:20:33.990 --> 00:20:34.823
Okay, here we go.

405
00:20:34.823 --> 00:20:39.823
Start, boom!, so we got the correct I'd

406
00:20:40.390 --> 00:20:41.830
of the item.

407
00:20:41.830 --> 00:20:43.143
We got the correct item

408
00:20:43.143 --> 00:20:45.870
because there is already in the cart.

409
00:20:45.870 --> 00:20:48.113
And then finally it says,

410
00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:50.980
there is an error

411
00:20:50.980 --> 00:20:54.873
that data got invalid none quantity.

412
00:20:58.560 --> 00:21:00.750
So, we'll go back to our code here

413
00:21:00.750 --> 00:21:01.860
and debug it.

414
00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:03.340
So, it says if there is an existingCartItem.

415
00:21:03.340 --> 00:21:05.690
So in this case, there is,

416
00:21:05.690 --> 00:21:06.860
I already have it in my cart.

417
00:21:06.860 --> 00:21:08.850
This is the Eddy cooler.

418
00:21:08.850 --> 00:21:11.583
So, what we're doing here is we are returning it.

419
00:21:13.260 --> 00:21:17.870
We take the existingCartItem quantity plus one.

420
00:21:17.870 --> 00:21:19.130
So, it's telling us

421
00:21:19.130 --> 00:21:23.030
that the value we're passing here is incorrect.

422
00:21:23.030 --> 00:21:26.050
So, let's console log the existingCartItem.

423
00:21:28.890 --> 00:21:31.790
And see if we can take a little bit of a closer look

424
00:21:31.790 --> 00:21:36.250
into why that is.

425
00:21:36.250 --> 00:21:39.580
Maybe this is like undefined for some reason,

426
00:21:39.580 --> 00:21:43.383
clear it out, run, addToCart.

427
00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:49.948
Ah, okay, I see.

428
00:21:49.948 --> 00:21:54.753
It's only returning to us the Id of that CartItem.

429
00:21:58.149 --> 00:21:59.760
So, just pause it there for a second to figure it out.

430
00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:01.390
And this has changed in Keystone

431
00:22:01.390 --> 00:22:04.430
is you have to explicitly tell it which fields you want.

432
00:22:04.430 --> 00:22:06.110
So, it's resolved fields

433
00:22:06.110 --> 00:22:07.780
and this is just you want the Id

434
00:22:07.780 --> 00:22:11.800
and the quantity of the item that comes back

435
00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:13.870
and that should fix it for us.

436
00:22:13.870 --> 00:22:15.247
You see, I just ran it right here.

437
00:22:15.247 --> 00:22:18.700
And it actually said there was three increment by one.

438
00:22:18.700 --> 00:22:21.893
So now if we run that again,

439
00:22:24.770 --> 00:22:27.710
it tells us there's four incremented by one.

440
00:22:27.710 --> 00:22:29.350
There's five incremented by one.

441
00:22:29.350 --> 00:22:31.853
If we go to the backend CartItems here,

442
00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:34.960
should see it, there we go.

443
00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:36.730
There's the Eddy cooler and there is six.

444
00:22:36.730 --> 00:22:38.700
So, now if I try to add a product

445
00:22:38.700 --> 00:22:40.637
that is not yet in my cart,

446
00:22:40.637 --> 00:22:42.703
I think this belt is not in it.

447
00:22:43.570 --> 00:22:44.913
Let's run it over here.

448
00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:47.063
Go ahead and run it.

449
00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:50.803
And there we go,

450
00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:54.020
it says adding to cart,

451
00:22:54.020 --> 00:22:55.173
but run it again,

452
00:22:56.340 --> 00:22:59.020
says there's already one increment by one.

453
00:22:59.020 --> 00:23:01.840
So, there should be a new item.

454
00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:02.673
There we go.

455
00:23:02.673 --> 00:23:04.399
Nice belt with two in it, okay, cool.

456
00:23:04.399 --> 00:23:06.970
So, that's our full agile cart resolver.

457
00:23:06.970 --> 00:23:08.070
Next, what we need to do,

458
00:23:08.070 --> 00:23:10.710
is to actually hook this up on the front-end,

459
00:23:10.710 --> 00:23:12.810
to a button so that when you click it,

460
00:23:12.810 --> 00:23:14.030
it will add it to cart,

461
00:23:14.030 --> 00:23:17.280
as well as re fetch the number of items

462
00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:18.113
that are in the cart,

463
00:23:18.113 --> 00:23:19.990
so we can display them on the front-end.
