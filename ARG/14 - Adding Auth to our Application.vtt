1
00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:02.290
<v Instructor>Get some Auth going</v>

2
00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:03.730
so no one can just walk in

3
00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:04.880
and start making users.

4
00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:05.970
We need to be able to log in

5
00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:07.540
before we can create that stuff.

6
00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:09.260
And then further on in this course

7
00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:12.470
we're gonna get fine grain into role control

8
00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:14.650
over who should be able to do what.

9
00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:16.910
So let's open up Keystone.ts

10
00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:17.930
and we've got this.

11
00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:20.900
This is our Keystone server config right here.

12
00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:22.360
What we're gonna do is we're gonna create

13
00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:24.820
a method called with Auth

14
00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:26.130
that has some settings in it.

15
00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.130
And that's gonna layer in the secret source.

16
00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.963
That is

17
00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.970
the ability to have Auth in Keystone.

18
00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:34.720
So we'll make that.

19
00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:36.760
Oh, lets say constant curly bracket

20
00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:38.230
say with Auth

21
00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:39.860
is equal to

22
00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:43.860
and we are going to use a method called create Auth.

23
00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:44.693
Create Auth

24
00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.573
boom, did that auto import it?

25
00:00:48.905 --> 00:00:50.060
Oh, it did.

26
00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:51.470
All right, so here we go.

27
00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:55.650
Import and create Auth from Keystone forward slash Auth.

28
00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:56.660
That's awesome.

29
00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:58.240
And inside of there it takes the settings subject.

30
00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:00.260
So first a couple of things we have to say,

31
00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.820
list key is going to be a user.

32
00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.280
Why? Because it needs to know which schema

33
00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.050
is going to be responsible for being the user, right?

34
00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:09.440
Like it could be customer,

35
00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.780
it could be obviously user in our case,

36
00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:12.850
it could be person,

37
00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:14.930
it could be company.

38
00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:17.290
In our case it's user that logs in.

39
00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:20.110
And then we gotta tell it the identity field,

40
00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:24.430
which field in user is going to identify the person.

41
00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:25.880
Our case is going to be email.

42
00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:27.260
Like what did they log in with?

43
00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.150
Is it gonna be their username, their email?

44
00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.670
Pretty much just one of two of those.

45
00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.713
The secret field, which that's going to be our password.

46
00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:38.700
That's the field that is,

47
00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.883
it's going to ask for when they type it in.

48
00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.840
That next up we want to say in it first item.

49
00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.750
So this is always kind of a chicken and egg thing

50
00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:49.010
where you get in as you turn on Auth

51
00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:50.400
but if you set it up

52
00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:51.530
and there is no users

53
00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:52.610
then how do you Auth.

54
00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.400
And what a lot of places do is they just

55
00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.670
you turn off Auth for a quick second, create a user

56
00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:59.530
and then turn it back on again.

57
00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:00.960
But Keystone has a really nice

58
00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.270
this thing called in it first item

59
00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.240
which is an object

60
00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.020
and inside of that we say fields,

61
00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:09.170
which fields do we want

62
00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:10.680
to allow them to in it with?

63
00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:13.810
We have the name, the field, the email field

64
00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.610
and the password field.

65
00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.540
And then finally we should say to do,

66
00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.020
add in

67
00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.040
initial roles here.

68
00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:25.810
Just because when we do add roles

69
00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:28.940
we should give this person every single role

70
00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.720
cause they are going to be the administrator.

71
00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.440
So I believe that's what we need.

72
00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.000
Now we have this method here called with Auth.

73
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.670
What we're gonna do is we're gonna wrap

74
00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:40.590
this config here in with Auth.

75
00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.090
So that and then we'll have to go all the way

76
00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:43.830
to the bottom here

77
00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.260
and add another parentheses.

78
00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:47.270
Okay.

79
00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:49.940
Next, cause we need to set up a session

80
00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:51.530
because like when somebody logs in

81
00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:52.690
it will set a cookie

82
00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:54.220
and that gives them a session.

83
00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:55.950
They are logged in until they log out

84
00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.370
or the cookie expires

85
00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:00.140
which we have set earlier.

86
00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:01.470
So we gotta go down here

87
00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.530
where we have to do add a session here.

88
00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:07.440
We will add our session argument here.

89
00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.580
And that will be with item capital I item data

90
00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:12.540
and inside of that,

91
00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.320
we have stateless

92
00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:18.550
sessions capital S and you pass it.

93
00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:21.500
Our session config that we did earlier

94
00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.370
remember up here

95
00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:26.190
were we have the max age and the secret.

96
00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:29.650
And then the second argument too with item data

97
00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:32.380
is going to be an object

98
00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:36.100
where we ask for

99
00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:38.350
the user ID every single time.

100
00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:39.680
And the reason why we do this

101
00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:40.780
is that we are going

102
00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:42.860
to get into permissions in the future videos.

103
00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:45.340
So we're just setting ourselves up for that.

104
00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.560
Essentially, what this will do is it will pass the ID

105
00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.640
and any other data we query

106
00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:51.630
along with every single session.

107
00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:53.900
And then anytime we wanna access the session

108
00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:57.200
we have access to the user's name, email, ID etc.

109
00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.820
All right, we got some problems here with item data,

110
00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:02.300
can't be imported, no suggestions

111
00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:04.180
and stateless sessions

112
00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:05.520
and can't be important either.

113
00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:07.760
Just copy both of those.

114
00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.480
We'll go to the top here

115
00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.850
and let's

116
00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:13.333
import both of those.

117
00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:21.260
With item data and stateless sessions.

118
00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.650
And that comes from at Keystone

119
00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:28.530
dash next or just at KeystoneJS.

120
00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:32.580
And the package is called Keystone.

121
00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:36.883
And then it's further inside of session.

122
00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:40.300
All right, so now we've got with item data

123
00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:41.730
and stateless sessions.

124
00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:43.110
The last thing is,

125
00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:44.860
remember this is allowed access.

126
00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:46.990
We are currently allowing it true

127
00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:49.910
for whoever.

128
00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:51.600
And if we left this as true

129
00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:54.350
it would still allow anybody to come in.

130
00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:56.220
So what we wanna do is

131
00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:59.080
show

132
00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:00.700
the UI

133
00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:03.300
only for people who

134
00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:05.360
pass this test.

135
00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:07.480
And you could do any logic you want in here,

136
00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:09.200
if they are admin or whatever.

137
00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:11.740
In our case we just wanna make sure

138
00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:15.470
that they have a session and they are logged in.

139
00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:16.900
So what we'll do here is

140
00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:18.270
it will actually pass us

141
00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:20.220
the session of the user

142
00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:22.070
and let's just console log it.

143
00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:23.330
So we see what's going on here,

144
00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:24.627
console.log(session).

145
00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:30.480
And then we will return

146
00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:35.100
if there is

147
00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:36.870
session.data.

148
00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:38.640
And then we'll put a question mark on there.

149
00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:41.300
And what that will do is if there is a session

150
00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:43.670
and there is a session.data

151
00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:45.730
then it will return true,

152
00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:46.810
they are logged in.

153
00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:48.850
Otherwise they are not logged in

154
00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:50.530
and it will show them that.

155
00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:52.973
So let's restart NPM run dev.

156
00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:57.070
Got a bit of an error here,

157
00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:59.620
session config, oh look at that.

158
00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:00.770
That should be a comma.

159
00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:02.760
And it's telling us

160
00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:06.000
unsafe return of any type.

161
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.850
We need to turn that into a bullion

162
00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:09.820
and the best way to coerce that into a bullion

163
00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:12.060
is put two bangs on the front.

164
00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:13.680
It's also telling us

165
00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:17.790
unsafe member access data on any value.

166
00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:19.120
And that's fine for now,

167
00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:20.700
we'll fix that in the future.

168
00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:22.370
Let's just get the sucker running

169
00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:24.970
and make sure that it asks us to login.

170
00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:26.383
Refresh this sucker.

171
00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:35.783
Boom, there we go.

172
00:06:35.783 --> 00:06:38.730
So this is that initial signup.

173
00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:40.150
Welcome to Keystone,

174
00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:41.721
create the first user.

175
00:06:41.721 --> 00:06:43.214
So, Wes Bos

176
00:06:43.214 --> 00:06:45.630
wesbos@gmail.com.

177
00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:48.870
And I gotta set my password to be, wes wes wes.

178
00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:52.000
Don't log into my online bank with this.

179
00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.850
Get started.

180
00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:55.660
Boom, created it.

181
00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:56.700
And look at this.

182
00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:59.840
Remember we console log the session right here.

183
00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:01.470
This is what a session looks like.

184
00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:03.240
It tells us the list key, the

185
00:07:04.656 --> 00:07:05.580
item ID

186
00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:08.497
and then it gives us the data that we've required.

187
00:07:08.497 --> 00:07:11.830
This is actually a GraphQL

188
00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:13.120
query.

189
00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:15.300
We are gonna be adding stuff here in the future

190
00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:18.470
but even if we were to add the name and email in there

191
00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:20.163
and restarted that sucker.

192
00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:24.690
You see look every single time there's a request

193
00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:27.420
the data about the user is passed along.

194
00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:29.620
And that can be really helpful

195
00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:31.320
for writing what is called middleware.

196
00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:33.860
If you won't allow somebody to do something

197
00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:36.100
or you wanna check if somebody has a certain role

198
00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:39.090
or you wanna see if they are signed in

199
00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:41.120
then you can always check their session

200
00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:42.887
and information about that user.

201
00:07:42.887 --> 00:07:45.130
And that that's great because you don't have

202
00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:46.530
to explicitly go out

203
00:07:46.530 --> 00:07:49.100
and query the data every single time.

204
00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:50.930
It just comes along with every single request.

205
00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:52.450
We did that in my Node course as well.

206
00:07:52.450 --> 00:07:54.130
and I really liked that.

207
00:07:54.130 --> 00:07:54.963
All right good,

208
00:07:54.963 --> 00:07:57.120
so now we have our sessions done.

209
00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:58.630
Let's get rid of that console.

210
00:07:58.630 --> 00:07:59.930
I'll leave that in

211
00:07:59.930 --> 00:08:02.460
just so in case you wanna take a look at it yourself.

212
00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:04.550
I find console logging is helpful.

213
00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:05.670
We got our users,

214
00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:07.160
now let's start getting going

215
00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:08.760
with the rest of the data types.
