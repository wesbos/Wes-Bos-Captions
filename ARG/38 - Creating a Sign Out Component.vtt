00:00:00.211 --> 00:00:01.559
(swooshing music)

2
00:00:01.559 --> 00:00:02.392
<v Instructor>All right,</v>

3
00:00:02.392 --> 00:00:03.530
I want you to try to do this one yourself.

4
00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:06.360
I want you to make a sign out component,

5
00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:09.380
put it in the URL bar, and then when someone clicks it,

6
00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:11.760
it should sign them out, obviously,

7
00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:15.000
and then re render the navigation

8
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.480
so that it shows them the signed out state.

9
00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.360
Okay, welcome back.

10
00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:22.280
Let's make a sign out component.

11
00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:23.870
We'll go to our components here

12
00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:28.450
and capital SignOut.js.

13
00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:31.420
I realized I didn't do a capital.

14
00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:33.180
Oh no, I did do a capital i on sign in.

15
00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.940
Okay, make sure, capitals are some of the biggest support

16
00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:36.773
requests I get.

17
00:00:36.773 --> 00:00:38.973
So make sure you catch those capitals.

18
00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.010
Then we'll go in here

19
00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:46.630
and we will make a function export default function,

20
00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:48.480
sign out.

21
00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.940
And from that we can return a button

22
00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.140
but the type of button, every time

23
00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:56.300
I do a type of button, I see this slide pops up.

24
00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:57.133
Get out of here.

25
00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:01.010
And in here, you can either do sign out

26
00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.400
or you could restructure the children

27
00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.833
and then just render it out here.

28
00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:13.780
But I'm just gonna have the word sign out just

29
00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:15.400
for simplicity sake.

30
00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:16.933
That's all we need.

31
00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:20.210
Then what we'll do is we'll make a mutation.

32
00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.423
So const signed out mutation.

33
00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:28.803
So say const.

34
00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:34.513
So say const sign Out mutation is equal

35
00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:41.800
to G Q L bum bum, bum, import that sucker.

36
00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.580
Try it again.

37
00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:46.163
Second time's a charm.

38
00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:50.470
And then inside of that, we need the mutation for it,

39
00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:52.430
so say mutation.

40
00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:53.970
In these cases I'm not gonna name it just

41
00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.060
'cause we don't need to name it

42
00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.600
if there's no arguments being passed

43
00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.330
and all you have to do is say end session

44
00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:05.450
and end session is a mutation in the Keystone backend

45
00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.830
but there's no parentheses on the end, curiously enough

46
00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.850
because it doesn't take any arguments or parameters

47
00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:14.730
or variables or whatever you're gonna call it.

48
00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.370
So somebody just end session.

49
00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.890
That's the entire thing that we have.

50
00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.790
Then we'll go here, say const square bracket, sign out.

51
00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.410
Then you can also have a loading error data

52
00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.420
all that stuff in our case, I don't think we need any of it.

53
00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:36.420
Just simply sign out as used mutation and that got imported

54
00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:42.240
good muse mutation takes a sign out mutation.

55
00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:48.610
And then the arguments for when they sig out is we wanna

56
00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:52.280
re fetch the current user so that it will re render.

57
00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.500
So we fetch queries

58
00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:01.423
Query current user query.

59
00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:04.740
Okay, let's deal with our squiggles.

60
00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:06.340
We don't need the children here.

61
00:03:07.994 --> 00:03:09.833
I got to import current user query.

62
00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:12.913
No suggestions.

63
00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:16.853
Why is that the case?

64
00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:23.340
Wonder if we do you see how I export it at there?

65
00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.330
What if we do this export current user query?

66
00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:28.780
Does that make it importable?

67
00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:31.610
Ha wow.

68
00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:33.773
So that's cool.

69
00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:38.110
That's good.

70
00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:42.977
And then we say on click is equal to sign out.

71
00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:48.290
All right, so I got my incognito mode.

72
00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:49.530
No, I don't.

73
00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:53.050
We'll go into our nav and import that button.

74
00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:55.100
So if the user is signed in,

75
00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:58.973
we need to have our sign out component.

76
00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:03.160
And then when they click it

77
00:04:05.676 --> 00:04:06.530
It didn't work.

78
00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:08.823
Let's take a look here.

79
00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.540
Oh, okay, so it did work, but it didn't refresh.

80
00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:15.940
Let's debug that I got now I got to sign in again.

81
00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:18.023
(laughs)

82
00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:29.240
Okay, now let's write some debugging here.

83
00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:33.350
So on click, sign out.

84
00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:34.630
If you need to debug it,

85
00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:36.780
you just put a little inline function here.

86
00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:42.423
Let's say sign out and we can also log signing out.

87
00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:54.010
Oh, it does work sometimes the fast reload

88
00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:55.690
or the hot reload, goofs it up.

89
00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:56.740
So nothing wrong with that.

90
00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:00.513
I can bring it back to this, sign out.

91
00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:07.690
This will technically pass the click event

92
00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:11.660
to our sign-out mutation, but it doesn't matter

93
00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:14.570
'cause there's nothing that is it's expecting.

94
00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:15.513
So that's fine.

95
00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:18.670
Let's just triple check that actually

96
00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:20.130
because that's the only thing we changed

97
00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:24.603
and it did work so log in sign out.

98
00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:27.420
Yeah, things are good.

99
00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:28.930
So, that's the sign out.

100
00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:30.950
See you in the next one.
