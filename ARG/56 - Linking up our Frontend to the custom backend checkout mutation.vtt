1
00:00:01.908 --> 00:00:03.130
<v Wes>All right, so to test what we've got so far.</v>

2
00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:05.090
I'm gonna do this in two steps.

3
00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:07.560
First, I'm gonna go on the frontend

4
00:00:08.523 --> 00:00:10.830
and we are console logging the payment method

5
00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.690
that will have the ID, and then we'll go to the backend

6
00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:15.430
and we'll actually mainly run it with the ID

7
00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:17.662
that comes back from this payment method.

8
00:00:17.662 --> 00:00:18.850
(clears throat)

9
00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:20.630
And if that works, we'll write the mutation

10
00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:21.920
and hook everything up.

11
00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:25.873
So let's go to, I just signed out.

12
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:27.973
The one Click.

13
00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:37.063
Okay, I am in, go to my cart,

14
00:00:39.346 --> 00:00:40.179
for two,

15
00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.463
so over my Dev tools.

16
00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.043
Clear everything out, check it.

17
00:00:52.076 --> 00:00:52.909
There we go.

18
00:00:52.909 --> 00:00:56.400
There is my ID, okay.

19
00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:00.410
Then I'll go to right here and pass that.

20
00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:02.493
So mutation checkout ID,

21
00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.780
and I'll go to my backend right here.

22
00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:08.613
Clear it out.

23
00:01:09.868 --> 00:01:12.040
Let's just triple check that the code is on the backend

24
00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.240
is actually going to call it a log, the charge.

25
00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.073
Oh, look, we didn't do that yet.

26
00:01:16.073 --> 00:01:20.850
So console.log, the charge, how to restart it now.

27
00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:26.040
These tokens are only good for one try.

28
00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.710
So if something breaks

29
00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:29.410
and you have to get another token.

30
00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.853
All right, so clear up my Dev tools, run it.

31
00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.670
And it worked, this is the charge.

32
00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:50.140
And I believe now if we go to our Keystone payments,

33
00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:54.430
there we go.

34
00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:57.930
January 15th is when I'm running and recording this.

35
00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.963
304 US dollars.

36
00:02:02.144 --> 00:02:02.977
Okay, so we know all of that's working.

37
00:02:02.977 --> 00:02:07.977
Let's go to our frontend and hookup the mutation.

38
00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:11.470
Let's go to somewhere near the top of our checkout here

39
00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:12.500
and write the mutation.

40
00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:17.500
So const, create, order mutation as you could do, GQL,

41
00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:21.733
let's import GQL.

42
00:02:27.842 --> 00:02:29.540
Here we go.

43
00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:34.540
We have a mutation called checkout and actually, no, sorry.

44
00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:36.850
I've been calling that create order mutation

45
00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:41.850
that takes in a token that is a string is required.

46
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.390
A difference between GraphQL types

47
00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:46.323
and TypeScript types is the capital on that string.

48
00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:49.220
Then inside of that,

49
00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.050
we actually run checkout where the token

50
00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:55.070
is the token variable that gets passed in.

51
00:02:55.070 --> 00:03:00.043
And back from that, we want the ID, the charge, the total,

52
00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:07.850
and then each item in that, which has ID and the name.

53
00:03:11.166 --> 00:03:12.200
I'm gonna save.

54
00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:13.910
And we'll take this create order mutation

55
00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:17.150
and we'll go into our checkout form here

56
00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.693
and just say const square bracket.

57
00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:26.813
Checkout, and any errors.

58
00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:32.430
This is going to put us in a bit of a pickle

59
00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:35.686
because we already have a variable called error in here.

60
00:03:35.686 --> 00:03:37.150
So we need to do is de structure that

61
00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.043
and we'll call it a GraphQL error.

62
00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:45.853
And oh, we need to de structure that here,

63
00:03:47.175 --> 00:03:50.883
curly brackets and that is equal to use mutation,

64
00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:57.280
make sure we import use mutation and that gets passed,

65
00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:59.583
create order mutation.

66
00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:04.970
And there is one variable that we need to pass,

67
00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:07.420
but the variable is token

68
00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:10.960
and we don't have the token variable just yet.

69
00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:15.240
We only have the token variable at this point.

70
00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:19.130
So this is a case where we can't pass it at definition time,

71
00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:21.283
but we will pass it at call time.

72
00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:23.780
So give that a save.

73
00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:26.423
It looks like everything is happy.

74
00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:32.580
And we'll go down here and let's take care of this error

75
00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:34.850
before we get anything here.

76
00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:36.230
We'll just duplicate that.

77
00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:38.350
And if there is any GraphQL errors

78
00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:39.210
and we'll display that

79
00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:41.700
you could also use your error component as well,

80
00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:44.070
if you want to use different styling, but in this case,

81
00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:47.130
I want to keep it nice and small, right above the checkout.

82
00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:50.860
Additionally, this error here we need to return

83
00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:55.740
from this function, which this stops the checkout

84
00:04:56.602 --> 00:04:59.010
from happening because there was clearly an error

85
00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:02.500
and also we need to take our end progress

86
00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:05.951
and called done on there because if there is an error,

87
00:05:05.951 --> 00:05:06.784
we need to say, all right, something happened

88
00:05:06.784 --> 00:05:08.410
we're still on this page.

89
00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:10.254
Let's display it to the user

90
00:05:10.254 --> 00:05:11.520
and stop this function from running.

91
00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:13.780
But number five is what we're here for

92
00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:15.320
is send the token from step three

93
00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:18.196
to the Keystone server via customization.

94
00:05:18.196 --> 00:05:20.970
So we can say const order is equal to await checkout

95
00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:26.750
and we can pass it our variables and the variable token

96
00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:31.643
is going to be the payment method.id.

97
00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:39.463
Now we have an order value here and we can console.log.

98
00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:47.320
Finished with the order, console.log order

99
00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:53.763
and then we want to change the page to view the order.

100
00:05:54.776 --> 00:05:58.420
And we will get to that in just a second,

101
00:05:58.420 --> 00:05:59.953
but let's see now,

102
00:05:59.953 --> 00:06:03.180
if we can do the whole creation of the charge

103
00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:06.150
just from the client side.

104
00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:09.230
So we'll go back to our payments here.

105
00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:13.210
We'll go to our Value here.

106
00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:14.210
This keeps getting bumped up

107
00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:17.170
'cause I keep bumping up this local host

108
00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:19.470
and then this local host gets bumped up again.

109
00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:23.437
But if I now check this out, checkout, good.

110
00:06:32.635 --> 00:06:34.250
And go to our payments

111
00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:36.723
and we should see another one for $304.

112
00:06:38.416 --> 00:06:40.280
Here it is beauty, beauty, beauty.

113
00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:41.470
So the next thing we need to do

114
00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:44.080
is hop back onto the server side, create the order,

115
00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:46.480
the order items, and clean up any current items

116
00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:47.313
that we may have

117
00:06:47.313 --> 00:06:49.453
and I'll catch you in the next video did you that.
