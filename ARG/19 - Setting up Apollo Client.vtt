00:00:01.491 --> 00:00:02.324
<v ->All right.</v>

2
00:00:02.324 --> 00:00:05.342
As we start to pull in data from our API

3
00:00:05.342 --> 00:00:07.960
into our front end of our application,

4
00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:09.245
we need some sort of software

5
00:00:09.245 --> 00:00:12.190
that's going to be able to make those queries,

6
00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:15.970
cache the data, evict those items from the data,

7
00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:17.830
handle mutations,

8
00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:20.382
give us the data that comes back from the server,

9
00:00:20.382 --> 00:00:21.215
if there's errors

10
00:00:21.215 --> 00:00:23.047
or if there's file uploads, all that stuff.

11
00:00:23.047 --> 00:00:25.253
So basically, we need a piece of software

12
00:00:25.253 --> 00:00:27.750
that will talk to our GraphQL API,

13
00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.780
and manage all of that data for us.

14
00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:30.743
And in this tutorial,

15
00:00:30.743 --> 00:00:33.822
we are using something called Apollo GraphQL for it

16
00:00:33.822 --> 00:00:35.491
or it's called Apollo Client.

17
00:00:35.491 --> 00:00:37.717
Specifically it's the piece of software

18
00:00:37.717 --> 00:00:39.810
we're gonna be using on the front end.

19
00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:42.634
Now, Apollo Client, I've got the finished product

20
00:00:42.634 --> 00:00:44.410
up and running right here.

21
00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:45.380
You can take a look here.

22
00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:47.433
You can see that we have GraphQL

23
00:00:47.433 --> 00:00:51.210
and here you could write all of the queries as well.

24
00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.062
Then we have all of the queries that we write for here.

25
00:00:54.062 --> 00:00:57.810
So here's an all products query.

26
00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:00.511
Give me the first four, but skipped 12, why?

27
00:01:00.511 --> 00:01:02.750
Because I'm on page...

28
00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:04.360
I'm on page four

29
00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.090
so I'm skipping 12 of them,

30
00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.570
and then I'm asking, give me the first four that come back.

31
00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:10.600
And in this case, it's just one

32
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.480
'cause there's only one on this page

33
00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:15.681
but if I were to go back a page, we would see that update.

34
00:01:15.681 --> 00:01:17.005
There is a little bit of an issue

35
00:01:17.005 --> 00:01:19.730
with Apollo dev tools right now.

36
00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:20.563
I'm hoping it will be fixed

37
00:01:20.563 --> 00:01:23.040
by the time you take this course

38
00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.040
but sometimes the data doesn't update on Apollo.

39
00:01:28.267 --> 00:01:30.665
And also sometimes it doesn't connect properly

40
00:01:30.665 --> 00:01:31.705
which is a bit of a bummer.

41
00:01:31.705 --> 00:01:34.250
They're working on like a big update.

42
00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:36.720
So I'm hoping by the time you read this,

43
00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:37.872
or by the time you watch this,

44
00:01:37.872 --> 00:01:39.020
it will be updated.

45
00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:40.000
See there. There it's working now.

46
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.070
So take a look at the queries,

47
00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:42.980
pagination query,

48
00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:45.607
give me the first four, skip eight.

49
00:01:45.607 --> 00:01:49.180
It shows you the entire query that we have written.

50
00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:52.204
And it's just so good for debugging API.

51
00:01:52.204 --> 00:01:54.880
You can also see any mutations that happen.

52
00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.960
For example, if we were to add an item to our cart,

53
00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.284
boop, boop, right?

54
00:02:00.284 --> 00:02:01.910
Look that's working.

55
00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:02.743
Add to cart.

56
00:02:02.743 --> 00:02:03.720
Add to cart.

57
00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.290
You see that when we add an item to our cart,

58
00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:07.510
we're passing it the ID

59
00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:10.360
and then it returns to us the ID of that item as well,

60
00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.710
as the quantity that we're in the cart.

61
00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:15.720
And we can see all that data specifically in there.

62
00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.720
Same thing, it also gives us the cache.

63
00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.970
This is really important because,

64
00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.427
you take a look at this page right here,

65
00:02:22.427 --> 00:02:24.920
watch, I'm gonna click next.

66
00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.998
See it took a second for the items to come in

67
00:02:26.998 --> 00:02:28.916
and that's because it had to go to the API and go back.

68
00:02:28.916 --> 00:02:32.641
But now if I go back back, boom, boom, boom.

69
00:02:32.641 --> 00:02:34.610
You see how instant that is?

70
00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:38.317
That's because Apollo GraphQL, is able to say,

71
00:02:38.317 --> 00:02:39.724
"Oh we've already done that.

72
00:02:39.724 --> 00:02:42.600
we already have those items

73
00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.130
and we don't need to go to the network for them.

74
00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:46.920
We can just serve them up from the cache."

75
00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.960
And it does a lot of that heavy lifting for you.

76
00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:51.539
So you simply just need to query the items,

77
00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:53.143
and it will figure out if it has them

78
00:02:53.143 --> 00:02:56.893
or it needs to go to the GraphQL API as well.

79
00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.230
So setting up Apollo,

80
00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:00.554
we need things that are called links.

81
00:03:00.554 --> 00:03:02.596
And if we take a look at the docs here for Apollo links

82
00:03:02.596 --> 00:03:04.537
they say that links is a standard interface

83
00:03:04.537 --> 00:03:08.280
for modifying control flow of GraphQL requests

84
00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.900
and fetching GraphQL results.

85
00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:11.750
What does that mean?

86
00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:14.149
Well, Apollo Client is made up of

87
00:03:14.149 --> 00:03:18.880
a number of different links and each link is responsible

88
00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:23.010
for handling how to deal with outgoing requests

89
00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.600
to get data or to update data,

90
00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:29.260
as well as responses coming back,

91
00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.124
as well as dealing with the cache and whatnot.

92
00:03:32.124 --> 00:03:36.640
And Apollo has all of the like basic stuff

93
00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:37.945
that most people would need.

94
00:03:37.945 --> 00:03:41.230
They put it into something called Apollo Boost

95
00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:44.803
and it sort of all just tucked away into a package

96
00:03:44.803 --> 00:03:47.536
because most of us just need the very simple things.

97
00:03:47.536 --> 00:03:49.030
We need a cache.

98
00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:52.580
We need fetching and pushing data to our API,

99
00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:56.418
and a couple other things that are pretty common.

100
00:03:56.418 --> 00:03:58.130
So what they do is they just wrap it up

101
00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:00.286
into their own little package called Apollo Boost.

102
00:04:00.286 --> 00:04:02.440
It's very, very popular.

103
00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:03.947
One thing that they don't do,

104
00:04:03.947 --> 00:04:05.112
and this is why I'm giving you

105
00:04:05.112 --> 00:04:06.438
a little bit of starter code for this

106
00:04:06.438 --> 00:04:09.307
is they don't handle image uploads.

107
00:04:09.307 --> 00:04:11.694
And in order for us to do image uploads,

108
00:04:11.694 --> 00:04:14.090
we need to use a third party package.

109
00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:18.130
And as soon as you need to use a secondary link,

110
00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:19.510
that is not part of Apollo Boost,

111
00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:21.950
you have to like sort of eject from Apollo Boost.

112
00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:24.610
So that's why if we go into our front end

113
00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:26.740
again we're not in the backend folder anymore.

114
00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:29.328
Go to your widthData.js file

115
00:04:29.328 --> 00:04:31.890
that is there inside of the lib.

116
00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:35.149
Now this is a whole lot of boiler plate code

117
00:04:35.149 --> 00:04:37.132
and I know you might not be thrilled

118
00:04:37.132 --> 00:04:39.310
that I've given it to you already,

119
00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:42.180
but I'm gonna go through with you,

120
00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:45.053
and sort of explain what each piece does.

121
00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:46.958
And quite honestly,

122
00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:50.045
this is code that you would copy paste from an example

123
00:04:50.045 --> 00:04:51.672
or get it from an existing one

124
00:04:51.672 --> 00:04:53.746
because it gets into the withs a little bit

125
00:04:53.746 --> 00:04:56.430
and that's exactly why they put it in a package

126
00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:00.260
like Apollo Boost because it is sort of boiler platey.

127
00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:01.093
So we have this

128
00:05:01.093 --> 00:05:02.690
and we also are gonna be adding a few things

129
00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:04.060
to it ourselves,

130
00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:05.345
but I thought I would go through it myself

131
00:05:05.345 --> 00:05:07.930
because there's a lot that needs to happen here.

132
00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:08.763
We need...

133
00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:12.050
So when we have Apollo Client,

134
00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:14.390
Apollo Client is again, if we look here,

135
00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:15.315
this is the Apollo Client

136
00:05:15.315 --> 00:05:19.010
with the cache and the queries and everything like that.

137
00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:20.565
We go ahead and create a Client,

138
00:05:20.565 --> 00:05:23.649
And then we inject a couple of different links that we have.

139
00:05:23.649 --> 00:05:27.147
This first link is an error handling link

140
00:05:27.147 --> 00:05:29.413
and all it does is

141
00:05:29.413 --> 00:05:32.040
it takes in two different types of errors

142
00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:34.412
that could possibly happen in your GraphQL requests.

143
00:05:34.412 --> 00:05:37.781
You could have GraphQL errors where

144
00:05:37.781 --> 00:05:42.480
as simple as your password was wrong, or you forgot...

145
00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:46.910
You requested a field that doesn't exist.

146
00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:49.900
Like if you request image on a product,

147
00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:50.850
it will say,

148
00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:52.270
Oh, did you mean images?

149
00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:53.350
Or did you mean photo?

150
00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:54.576
And it will just bring those back.

151
00:05:54.576 --> 00:05:58.520
And it's really helpful just to simply console.log those out

152
00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:01.839
because otherwise you have to like dig into the network tab

153
00:06:01.839 --> 00:06:02.852
to see what went wrong.

154
00:06:02.852 --> 00:06:05.536
So this is just really helpful in my experience.

155
00:06:05.536 --> 00:06:07.550
A second one is in network error.

156
00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:09.740
And this happens if your backend is down

157
00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:10.730
for whatever reason,

158
00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:13.732
or you have CORS issues or something like that.

159
00:06:13.732 --> 00:06:15.780
Most commonly for us,

160
00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:16.681
I get this error is that

161
00:06:16.681 --> 00:06:18.730
like I forgot to start the backend

162
00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:20.664
and you're running your front end of your application

163
00:06:20.664 --> 00:06:23.840
and it pings the API endpoint,

164
00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:28.840
and it gets a 400 or 500 or 404 response from it.

165
00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:31.870
So in our case, we just log out the network error,

166
00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:34.533
and that will help us debug exactly what's going on.

167
00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:37.920
So that's the first one.

168
00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:40.513
The second one, and this is the big one is,

169
00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:43.140
Apollo HTTP link.

170
00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:44.536
So this is the really popular one

171
00:06:44.536 --> 00:06:46.801
that pretty much everybody will use.

172
00:06:46.801 --> 00:06:50.378
And this is responsible for fetching data

173
00:06:50.378 --> 00:06:54.130
as well as making post requests,

174
00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:56.652
which is when you wanna update or delete

175
00:06:56.652 --> 00:06:59.038
or create a new item.

176
00:06:59.038 --> 00:07:02.860
And inside of react, Apollo is gonna give us

177
00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:06.643
both query and mutation hooks that will allow us to do that.

178
00:07:06.643 --> 00:07:08.538
And this HTTP link is going to allow us.

179
00:07:08.538 --> 00:07:10.097
You might be saying like

180
00:07:10.097 --> 00:07:12.690
"Wes, that doesn't say HTTP link,

181
00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:14.960
that says create upload link."

182
00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:16.600
So the thing we need to know is that

183
00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:20.630
this is this separate package called create upload link,

184
00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:22.780
called Apollo upload Client.

185
00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:24.410
And essentially what they have done

186
00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:28.160
is they've taken Apollo HTTP link,

187
00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:30.350
and layered on additional code

188
00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:33.180
in order to allow us to do file uploads

189
00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:34.580
which is exactly what we need.

190
00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:37.400
So again, don't sweat this too much.

191
00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:39.901
This is getting a little bit into the withs here

192
00:07:39.901 --> 00:07:41.054
but if we take a look here,

193
00:07:41.054 --> 00:07:43.312
it says where's the GraphQL endpoint

194
00:07:43.312 --> 00:07:47.410
and if we take a look at our config.js

195
00:07:47.410 --> 00:07:50.075
you'll see we have a localhost 3000, API/GraphQL.

196
00:07:50.075 --> 00:07:52.335
And if you visit that URL in your browser,

197
00:07:52.335 --> 00:07:55.216
you'll see this is the one that we were working with earlier

198
00:07:55.216 --> 00:07:56.700
where we can query things.

199
00:07:56.700 --> 00:08:00.080
So that's the URL of our GraphQL endpoint.

200
00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:01.711
And then we'll also have a production endpoint

201
00:08:01.711 --> 00:08:04.560
where I'll pop the URL in there.

202
00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:05.398
And then I have one more thing

203
00:08:05.398 --> 00:08:08.893
is how many items should be shown per page.

204
00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:11.448
You could also put these as environmental variables,

205
00:08:11.448 --> 00:08:15.640
but in my experience, it's sometimes a little easier

206
00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:17.590
if they're not sensitive information

207
00:08:17.590 --> 00:08:18.805
just pop them in a JS file

208
00:08:18.805 --> 00:08:21.942
so you can import and export them as you need it.

209
00:08:21.942 --> 00:08:23.030
What else?

210
00:08:23.030 --> 00:08:25.060
FetchOption include credentials.

211
00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:27.820
So that means whenever it goes off and fetches data

212
00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:29.500
from our GraphQL endpoint,

213
00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:31.813
should it send the cookies along for the ride?

214
00:08:31.813 --> 00:08:33.030
And in our case, yes

215
00:08:33.030 --> 00:08:37.180
because we need to see if uses are logged in or not,

216
00:08:37.180 --> 00:08:38.451
depending on what they're allowed to do

217
00:08:38.451 --> 00:08:41.740
or what pieces of information they're allowed to see.

218
00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:44.940
And then also, pass along the headers from their request.

219
00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:45.880
This is really, really important

220
00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:50.260
because we are using server-side rendering.

221
00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:55.260
And if you are trying to server-side render logged in state,

222
00:08:55.430 --> 00:08:58.100
like for example, I go to this page right here

223
00:08:58.100 --> 00:08:59.423
and I refresh.

224
00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:02.210
Oh, I am...

225
00:09:02.210 --> 00:09:03.263
I got signed out.

226
00:09:04.137 --> 00:09:07.080
I got signed out because I signed into my other one.

227
00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:11.350
So maybe if I open this up in an incognito tab

228
00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:13.093
and I go ahead and sign in,

229
00:09:14.289 --> 00:09:17.311
gmail.com, Wes, Wes, Wes.

230
00:09:17.311 --> 00:09:18.280
There we go.

231
00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:20.540
So watch, when I refresh this page,

232
00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:22.530
you see how like it shows my cart.

233
00:09:22.530 --> 00:09:27.410
All of these things are in the signed in state immediately.

234
00:09:27.410 --> 00:09:28.776
If you've ever been to a website

235
00:09:28.776 --> 00:09:31.990
and you get like a little flicker

236
00:09:31.990 --> 00:09:33.730
that says log in for a second

237
00:09:33.730 --> 00:09:35.389
and then a split second later it says,

238
00:09:35.389 --> 00:09:38.270
Oh, sign out and it shows like your avatar,

239
00:09:38.270 --> 00:09:40.560
that's because on the server side,

240
00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:42.150
they don't know if you're signed in or not.

241
00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:44.579
So they just send the logged out version to the thing

242
00:09:44.579 --> 00:09:46.671
and then they have to rerender it on the Client side.

243
00:09:46.671 --> 00:09:50.300
And that's really annoying 'cause you get this like flicker.

244
00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:55.300
So by sending along all the cookies and headers

245
00:09:56.018 --> 00:10:00.530
with every single request, it will allow us to render

246
00:10:02.144 --> 00:10:04.393
on the server side, all of the logged in states

247
00:10:04.393 --> 00:10:06.290
so you don't get that weird flicker

248
00:10:06.290 --> 00:10:08.370
every single time that you run the thing.

249
00:10:08.370 --> 00:10:10.050
So that was really important to me.

250
00:10:10.050 --> 00:10:14.390
And that is why I stick the JWT into a cookie,

251
00:10:14.390 --> 00:10:16.010
and not into local storage,

252
00:10:16.010 --> 00:10:18.365
because local storage can't be sent to the server

253
00:10:18.365 --> 00:10:19.802
when somebody refreshes the page,

254
00:10:19.802 --> 00:10:21.600
but cookies can be

255
00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:24.730
and that's by these two things right here.

256
00:10:24.730 --> 00:10:27.420
Last thing, whoo, I know this is a lot stick with me.

257
00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:29.720
We're gonna get into writing some react code

258
00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:30.693
in just a second.

259
00:10:31.532 --> 00:10:32.874
The last thing is a cache.

260
00:10:32.874 --> 00:10:35.880
So where will you be storing the cache?

261
00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:37.932
Most popular way is just in memory

262
00:10:37.932 --> 00:10:39.754
meaning that in the browser.

263
00:10:39.754 --> 00:10:42.204
So if I go to this page right here

264
00:10:42.204 --> 00:10:44.340
and I'm clicking back and forth,

265
00:10:44.340 --> 00:10:45.740
you see how it's nice and fast.

266
00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:48.940
But then if I had to refresh the page, that cache has gone

267
00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:50.457
and that's okay, 'cause that's all you want.

268
00:10:50.457 --> 00:10:52.340
You just want it for the users

269
00:10:52.340 --> 00:10:54.070
however long they have visited.

270
00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:55.307
We will get a little bit more

271
00:10:55.307 --> 00:10:58.840
into something called typepolicies, but not for now.

272
00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:01.600
And then finally this little bit right here

273
00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:04.335
it will restore any initial state.

274
00:11:04.335 --> 00:11:06.610
And what that does is

275
00:11:06.610 --> 00:11:11.610
because we're initially rendering these views on the server,

276
00:11:11.610 --> 00:11:14.710
we need to hot potato all the data

277
00:11:14.710 --> 00:11:17.370
that was collected on the server Apollo Client,

278
00:11:17.370 --> 00:11:22.110
and we need to give it to the hydration on the Client.

279
00:11:22.110 --> 00:11:24.140
And that's exactly what this is doing.

280
00:11:24.140 --> 00:11:27.250
It's saying if there's any initial state, then restore it,

281
00:11:27.250 --> 00:11:29.231
otherwise, go ahead.

282
00:11:29.231 --> 00:11:33.120
Last thing we just need to know is this getDataFromTree.

283
00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:35.320
We take a look where that's used right here.

284
00:11:36.533 --> 00:11:37.624
We're using a package called

285
00:11:37.624 --> 00:11:42.624
withApollo that allows us to crawl

286
00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:45.450
all of our arch pages and components,

287
00:11:45.450 --> 00:11:47.860
and look for any queries that we have.

288
00:11:47.860 --> 00:11:49.846
So queries for products and users

289
00:11:49.846 --> 00:11:52.030
and orders and things like that.

290
00:11:52.030 --> 00:11:53.940
And it will crawl them,

291
00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:56.200
and it will make sure that we have fetched

292
00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:58.672
and it will wait for all that data to be fetched

293
00:11:58.672 --> 00:12:01.556
before the server sends the HTML

294
00:12:01.556 --> 00:12:03.640
from the server to the Client.

295
00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:05.320
So, I know that's a whole lot,

296
00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:06.886
and that's why they often tuck away this

297
00:12:06.886 --> 00:12:09.400
into a nice little Apollo Boost.

298
00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:11.490
But I thought I would go through that with you.

299
00:12:11.490 --> 00:12:12.457
So, I know that's a lot

300
00:12:12.457 --> 00:12:14.730
but now what we'll do is we'll actually

301
00:12:14.730 --> 00:12:17.020
take this with data function,

302
00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:19.730
and we'll create an instance of Apollo,

303
00:12:19.730 --> 00:12:21.640
and inject it into our application.

304
00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:23.720
And the place where we do that,

305
00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:27.320
is inside of our Underscore app.js file.

306
00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:28.980
Remember we did this.

307
00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:32.256
And we need to wrap our entire application

308
00:12:32.256 --> 00:12:34.470
in what's called a provider.

309
00:12:34.470 --> 00:12:36.310
And a provider in react,

310
00:12:36.310 --> 00:12:39.054
is a component that usually lives

311
00:12:39.054 --> 00:12:42.060
very high in your application,

312
00:12:42.060 --> 00:12:46.982
and then it allows components that are several levels deep

313
00:12:46.982 --> 00:12:49.370
in order to access that data.

314
00:12:49.370 --> 00:12:50.782
So for example

315
00:12:50.782 --> 00:12:54.667
the Apollo Client is at an application level

316
00:12:54.667 --> 00:12:58.180
meaning that anywhere inside of this application,

317
00:12:58.180 --> 00:13:01.993
I can go and fetch data from the Apollo Client.

318
00:13:01.993 --> 00:13:05.150
Even if I need like the price,

319
00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:07.940
I can get that at this product level component,

320
00:13:07.940 --> 00:13:10.930
even though it probably lives at a much higher level.

321
00:13:10.930 --> 00:13:12.840
And that's what a provider does, is it,

322
00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:15.160
you stick a provider very nice and high.

323
00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:16.428
We're gonna be creating our own providers

324
00:13:16.428 --> 00:13:17.710
for things like the cart.

325
00:13:17.710 --> 00:13:18.580
So we'll get to that.

326
00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:21.623
But for now, let's go into our app.js,

327
00:13:21.623 --> 00:13:25.485
and around our page we will give ourselves a new tag

328
00:13:25.485 --> 00:13:28.903
called Apollo provider.

329
00:13:30.610 --> 00:13:33.466
And you see that it imported the Apollo provider

330
00:13:33.466 --> 00:13:35.370
from Apollo Client.

331
00:13:35.370 --> 00:13:39.593
And then we will wrap that in our entire page here,

332
00:13:40.450 --> 00:13:44.913
then Apollo provider needs a Client property,

333
00:13:45.870 --> 00:13:49.140
and we are going to make one, so right above here.

334
00:13:49.140 --> 00:13:52.240
And that is gonna come in via up here.

335
00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:53.230
So we'll say...

336
00:13:53.230 --> 00:13:56.450
Next to page props we'll also destructure Apollo,

337
00:13:56.450 --> 00:13:59.080
and we'll put it into our Client here.

338
00:13:59.080 --> 00:13:59.913
And you may be saying like,

339
00:13:59.913 --> 00:14:01.650
"Okay Wes, but like

340
00:14:01.650 --> 00:14:02.680
where does that come from?

341
00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:06.720
Like if my app is as high as we possibly can get

342
00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:11.720
in our application, who's handing us the Apollo prop Wes?"

343
00:14:12.043 --> 00:14:17.043
Well, the answer to that is when we export our application,

344
00:14:18.140 --> 00:14:22.550
we're gonna wrap it with data function.

345
00:14:22.550 --> 00:14:25.130
And what that will do is it's going to

346
00:14:25.130 --> 00:14:27.690
give us our entire application component,

347
00:14:27.690 --> 00:14:30.570
but it will give it to us with our data.

348
00:14:30.570 --> 00:14:31.403
That's why it's called withData.

349
00:14:31.403 --> 00:14:33.950
So what we'll do here is,

350
00:14:33.950 --> 00:14:37.813
we'll take off the export default from my app,

351
00:14:38.710 --> 00:14:43.406
and we'll go down here and we'll say export default my app

352
00:14:43.406 --> 00:14:47.153
okay normal, but we'll wrap it in withData.

353
00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:55.740
And then we'll need to import that with data function, boom,

354
00:14:55.740 --> 00:14:58.787
from lib withData.

355
00:14:58.787 --> 00:15:00.335
And now what that will do is it says,

356
00:15:00.335 --> 00:15:01.654
okay, give me my app

357
00:15:01.654 --> 00:15:05.843
but inject the Apollo Client along inside of it.

358
00:15:05.843 --> 00:15:07.000
Okay.

359
00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:08.374
That was a little bit of code that we wrote.

360
00:15:08.374 --> 00:15:11.970
And let's just go and see if it's working so far.

361
00:15:11.970 --> 00:15:12.803
And what you can do is...

362
00:15:12.803 --> 00:15:16.750
Let's just console.log Apollo inside of here.

363
00:15:16.750 --> 00:15:19.751
We'll go back to our actual application

364
00:15:19.751 --> 00:15:22.163
which is on localhost 777.

365
00:15:23.110 --> 00:15:24.950
Gonna open up my dev tools.

366
00:15:24.950 --> 00:15:26.450
Just refresh the page,

367
00:15:26.450 --> 00:15:29.550
and look, this is our Apollo Client right here.

368
00:15:29.550 --> 00:15:31.243
You see it's got cache,

369
00:15:32.263 --> 00:15:33.250
a whole bunch of other stuff

370
00:15:33.250 --> 00:15:37.170
mutate, query, query deduplication.

371
00:15:37.170 --> 00:15:39.140
Most of the stuff we don't have to care about

372
00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:42.740
but you should also see the Apollo dev tools,

373
00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:45.340
is now popped up in our application

374
00:15:45.340 --> 00:15:46.736
because it has figured out,

375
00:15:46.736 --> 00:15:50.090
oh you actually have an Apollo Client now,

376
00:15:50.090 --> 00:15:51.540
so we can see inside of it.

377
00:15:51.540 --> 00:15:53.257
And if we look at it, there's nothing there

378
00:15:53.257 --> 00:15:54.932
'cause we haven't actually written any queries

379
00:15:54.932 --> 00:15:57.500
or mutations just yet.

380
00:15:57.500 --> 00:15:58.920
The last thing we need to do here

381
00:15:58.920 --> 00:16:02.503
is to tell Next.js,

382
00:16:03.380 --> 00:16:07.687
that it needs to go and fetch all of the queries

383
00:16:07.687 --> 00:16:10.300
that are in all of the children components.

384
00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:11.320
So what we'll do here is we'll say,

385
00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:13.467
my app.getInitialProps.

386
00:16:19.010 --> 00:16:20.006
My app.getInitialProps,

387
00:16:20.006 --> 00:16:22.950
that is a specific Next.js thing.

388
00:16:22.950 --> 00:16:24.351
And this is in a sync method

389
00:16:24.351 --> 00:16:28.484
meaning that we can wait on it to do anything.

390
00:16:28.484 --> 00:16:31.308
You could wait on it to go fetch data from an API.

391
00:16:31.308 --> 00:16:32.830
You could wait 10 seconds

392
00:16:32.830 --> 00:16:35.403
if you want it to delay your loading by 10 seconds

393
00:16:35.403 --> 00:16:36.730
for whatever reasons.

394
00:16:36.730 --> 00:16:39.320
But that's what we mean by in a sync function.

395
00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:42.263
'So it's equal to a sync function.

396
00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:46.013
And in that, the props of that function

397
00:16:46.013 --> 00:16:51.013
will destructure the component, and CTX, the context

398
00:16:51.550 --> 00:16:56.267
and we'll say, let pageProps is equal to that,

399
00:16:56.267 --> 00:17:00.447
and we'll say, if the component.getInitialProps,

400
00:17:02.740 --> 00:17:06.367
then we will say, pageProps dot...

401
00:17:06.367 --> 00:17:11.133
Oh no, is equal to await component.getInitialProps

402
00:17:12.774 --> 00:17:14.280
and we'll pass the context.

403
00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:16.805
So essentially what we're doing right here is we're saying

404
00:17:16.805 --> 00:17:18.790
if any of the pages have

405
00:17:18.790 --> 00:17:21.187
a getInitialProps method on them,

406
00:17:21.187 --> 00:17:22.560
which they will,

407
00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:25.650
because that's what withData is adding to them

408
00:17:25.650 --> 00:17:28.492
then we're going to just wait and go and fetch it.

409
00:17:28.492 --> 00:17:31.651
Again, this is more boiler plate that happens

410
00:17:31.651 --> 00:17:36.651
because of how Apollo and Next.js work together.

411
00:17:36.735 --> 00:17:38.834
And then underneath here, what we'll do is we'll say,

412
00:17:38.834 --> 00:17:43.300
pageProps.query is equal to ctx.query,

413
00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:46.314
and that will allow us to get the any query variables

414
00:17:46.314 --> 00:17:48.189
like Forward slash products,

415
00:17:48.189 --> 00:17:52.130
forward slash two available at a page level,

416
00:17:52.130 --> 00:17:54.197
and then we'll return pageProps.

417
00:17:56.471 --> 00:17:57.480
Beautiful.

418
00:17:57.480 --> 00:17:59.907
Okay. So that is our app.

419
00:17:59.907 --> 00:18:02.130
Let's just triple check that it's still working.

420
00:18:02.130 --> 00:18:03.160
There's no errors.

421
00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:05.071
No. This is looking pretty good.

422
00:18:05.071 --> 00:18:06.574
This is not my most favorite thing.

423
00:18:06.574 --> 00:18:10.950
I wish that this would be tucked away a little bit nicer,

424
00:18:10.950 --> 00:18:13.061
but that is sort of a side effect

425
00:18:13.061 --> 00:18:16.140
of JavaScript in general is that,

426
00:18:16.140 --> 00:18:19.610
you're taking two things that have no idea about each other

427
00:18:19.610 --> 00:18:21.600
and if you wanna make them work together,

428
00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:25.030
you sometimes have to write 30 or 40 lines of glue

429
00:18:25.030 --> 00:18:26.127
in order to get them to work together.

430
00:18:26.127 --> 00:18:28.260
So, good job getting through that,

431
00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:29.930
let's get into some more fun stuff

432
00:18:29.930 --> 00:18:31.155
which is writing queries and mutations

433
00:18:31.155 --> 00:18:33.527
and writing some react hooks.

434
00:18:33.527 --> 00:18:34.977
I'll see you in the next one.
