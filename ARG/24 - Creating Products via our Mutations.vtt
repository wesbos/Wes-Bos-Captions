00:00:01.782 --> 00:00:02.620
<v Instructor>All right, let's hook it up</v>

2
00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:04.510
to our actual GraphQL API.

3
00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:05.890
If we go to our backend here

4
00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:08.650
and we go to our API Explorer.

5
00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:09.700
Let's first figure out

6
00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:13.110
what mutation we actually need in order for it to work.

7
00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.720
So I'm gonna open up yet another tab here.

8
00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:17.330
We'll say mutation.

9
00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:19.510
And then basically we just type, create.

10
00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:20.630
And you can see a listing

11
00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:23.910
of all the create mutations we have.

12
00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.730
In our case, it's create product.

13
00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:28.480
There's also create products for multiple.

14
00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:29.960
And you can see here, the only difference

15
00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.610
is that the type here is an array of products,

16
00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.690
whereas this is just a type of product.

17
00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:36.503
So we'll use create product.

18
00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.240
The way that it works is that

19
00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:42.160
you open up your curly brackets here

20
00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.590
and you pass in the data.

21
00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:48.040
And then for the data, it just asks for the name.

22
00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.323
Let's just call it the sample product.

23
00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:57.090
And let's say, description is testing.

24
00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.780
And what else does it need?
The photo.

25
00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:00.200
The photo we're not gonna be able to do

26
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:03.760
'cause there is no file upload built in here.

27
00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.980
The whole file upload thing in GraphQL,

28
00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:09.230
there's not a standard on how to do it.

29
00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:11.690
So you're not gonna see any support for that

30
00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:13.220
in this GraphQL playground.

31
00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.160
And that's the reason why we've,

32
00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.670
if we open up our with data, that's the reason

33
00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.150
why we went with this Apollo upload client,

34
00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:21.530
because it bakes it in for us.

35
00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:23.290
So we can just throw it a file

36
00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:26.400
and it'll be able to handle it for us.

37
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.423
The other thing we want is the price.

38
00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.630
So that's what you pass as an argument to the function.

39
00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.920
And then from that, you simply ask for the return data,

40
00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.600
where you say, "Okay, go and make this.

41
00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.460
And then when you done making it, bring me back,

42
00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.720
ID, the price, the description.

43
00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.270
Bring me back the actual data from the database."

44
00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:52.460
Most likely we want the actual ID of the item.

45
00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:53.360
And now if we run this,

46
00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.130
I'm not sure if it's going to work or not.

47
00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:56.600
We'll go ahead and try.

48
00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.010
There we go, it worked.

49
00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:01.260
And I believe now, if we go to our products here,

50
00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.020
there's our sample product.

51
00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.060
And you'll see it's in draft state.

52
00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.623
We can also run it again and say,

53
00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.600
the status is going to be...

54
00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.100
What was the...?

55
00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.933
Available.

56
00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.063
Now run that.

57
00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.230
Okay, we made another product.

58
00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:24.857
Back to our products here, there it is.

59
00:02:24.857 --> 00:02:26.700
And it's in available state.

60
00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.840
So that's what we're going to be doing,

61
00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:29.673
but we're going to do it

62
00:02:29.673 --> 00:02:30.980
with the data that comes from the form

63
00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.800
instead of manually running it here.

64
00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.800
So let's just delete those two suckers

65
00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.150
'cause I don't need them.

66
00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:38.830
So we'll go over here.

67
00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:43.100
And above here, we gotta first make our mutation.

68
00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:48.040
So we'll say const create product mutation

69
00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.513
is equal to gql.

70
00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.230
And we'll auto-import that.

71
00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:56.290
So that gets imported from GraphQL tag.

72
00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:00.860
And then in here, you can just take this

73
00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:02.083
and paste it in here.

74
00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:04.820
And then we can go

75
00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:07.460
and we need to make it a little bit further.

76
00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:09.640
So we need to give it a name.

77
00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.020
And that's because the create product mutation

78
00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:13.930
is going to be taking variables.

79
00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:16.120
So here we're hard coding it

80
00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.940
but we need to make this a flexible mutation

81
00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:21.990
meaning that we can pass in dynamic data,

82
00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:24.200
known as variables in GraphQL.

83
00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:27.170
So I like to just name them the same thing,

84
00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:28.683
create product mutation.

85
00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:31.750
And then inside of here

86
00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:34.550
is where we define which variables get passed in.

87
00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:36.747
So we can leave a little comment, say,

88
00:03:36.747 --> 00:03:41.590
"Which variables are getting passed in

89
00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:44.630
and what types are they?"

90
00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:48.470
So we're expecting somebody to pass us in a name variable,

91
00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:51.310
which is a string, and we'll put a bang on the end.

92
00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:53.190
And that's how in GraphQL you tell it

93
00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:54.740
if something is required.

94
00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:57.440
So we'll say description is going to be a string

95
00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:59.350
that is required.

96
00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:01.230
We have a price that's coming in,

97
00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:03.260
that is an integer, that is required.

98
00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.260
So that's why we are, remember in our use form hook

99
00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.370
we're converting it from a string to a number.

100
00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:09.250
That's because if you try

101
00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:12.850
to send a price of like a hundred as a string,

102
00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:13.937
it's going to yell at you and be like,

103
00:04:13.937 --> 00:04:16.840
"Hey, we need an integer, not a string."

104
00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:19.890
And then we want a image, which is a type of upload.

105
00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:22.630
And I'm not going to put an exclamation on there

106
00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:26.020
'cause it's possible to upload them without an image.

107
00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:29.280
Then we go here and we're able to use

108
00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:32.630
these variables, that we've created here,

109
00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:33.850
we were able to use them

110
00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:36.140
in our actual create product mutation.

111
00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:38.180
So we go here, data.

112
00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:43.180
And try your hardest not to think of this as JavaScript,

113
00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:47.080
because this is GraphQL notation

114
00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:48.870
and you can't really

115
00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:51.460
use JavaScript variables inside of here.

116
00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:53.560
You can because it's a string,

117
00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:55.100
and I'll show you how to do that later,

118
00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:56.610
but generally you should try to stick

119
00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:00.270
with keeping it a nice clean GraphQL mutation.

120
00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:02.810
And that will allow us to test it and move it around

121
00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:04.640
and make it flexible as possible.

122
00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:06.290
So the name being passed in

123
00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:08.130
is going to be our name variable.

124
00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:09.400
The description being passed in

125
00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:12.470
is obviously our description variable.

126
00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:15.430
The price is obviously the price.

127
00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:16.820
The status will be,

128
00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:18.740
let's leave that as just hard-coded available.

129
00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:22.600
I know that we set it as draft as default

130
00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:24.040
but if somebody's uploading it,

131
00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:26.490
not from the back end but from the front end,

132
00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:28.000
let's default that to status.

133
00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.870
And we can do that just by doing that.

134
00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:32.470
And then the last one is the photo, right?

135
00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:35.150
Because we're bringing in this image variable here

136
00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:37.040
and we need to create a photo.

137
00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:39.990
But we have a little bit of a dilemma here

138
00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:44.030
because a photo is not simply just a field.

139
00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:46.990
Remember when we created our backend,

140
00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:49.560
photo was its own type?

141
00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:51.430
If we look at our mutation here, we could run it.

142
00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:55.400
We say create product image, right?

143
00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:57.330
The product image is not a product,

144
00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:59.810
it's its own type where there's a relationship.

145
00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:01.153
So you might think, okay,

146
00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:04.800
when we submit this thing

147
00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:07.220
do we first have to create the product image,

148
00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:08.310
wait for it to come back,

149
00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:10.820
get the ID of that, and then submit it?

150
00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:11.900
And answer to that is, no.

151
00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:16.130
You can actually do nested creates

152
00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:20.517
and link them as a relationship all from one query.

153
00:06:20.517 --> 00:06:22.670
And this is specific to KeystoneJS,

154
00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:26.060
although this is a very popular thing in lots of CMS.

155
00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:30.770
So we'll set the photo to, create is the actual name.

156
00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:33.030
We're going to say, go ahead and create.

157
00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:37.020
And that has an image field, which is our image variable.

158
00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:39.930
And alt text is going to be,

159
00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:42.740
we could say the name or the description of both.

160
00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:46.220
So what this will do is, it'll say the photo is,

161
00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:49.610
oh, go ahead and create a relationship here.

162
00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:52.470
But also create the item behind the scenes

163
00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:55.350
and then use the image and the alt text for that.

164
00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:58.810
And then when we're done here, we'll ask for the ID,

165
00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:01.240
the price, the description.

166
00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:03.993
We want the name and then we want the photo.

167
00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:06.200
We actually don't need the photo.

168
00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:08.050
All we really need is the ID

169
00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:09.820
because what we're going to be doing here

170
00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:12.010
is that when somebody uploads something

171
00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:13.720
we're just going to move them over

172
00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:17.640
to the individual page for that image.

173
00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:19.640
So we really just need the ID here.

174
00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:21.410
I'm gonna keep price, description, name on there

175
00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:24.860
just so I can show you what comes back from this mutation.

176
00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:25.693
All right.

177
00:07:25.693 --> 00:07:26.640
So that's that.

178
00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:29.610
That's our actual mutation that we just wrote out there.

179
00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:32.800
Now, in order to hook it up inside of this onsubmit,

180
00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:36.510
we need to use the use mutation hook

181
00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:37.690
inside of our component.

182
00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:38.840
So we'll say const,

183
00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:40.520
and I'm just gonna call that payload for now.

184
00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:41.353
We're going to come back

185
00:07:41.353 --> 00:07:43.460
and destructure that sucker in just a second.

186
00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:45.720
I'll say use mutation.

187
00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:48.330
That is a method that comes from,

188
00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:52.180
it just auto imported from Apollo client.

189
00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:54.260
And use mutation takes,

190
00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:57.543
the first argument is going to be the actual mutation,

191
00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:00.310
create product mutation.

192
00:08:00.310 --> 00:08:03.220
And then the second argument to use mutation

193
00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:05.680
is any additional data that needs to come along.

194
00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:09.423
In our case, we want to pass along some variables.

195
00:08:10.590 --> 00:08:12.646
And the variables are going to be

196
00:08:12.646 --> 00:08:15.770
everything that we have, image, name, price, description,

197
00:08:15.770 --> 00:08:17.250
everything that we have in our inputs.

198
00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:20.500
So we can simply just pass along the whole object

199
00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:24.380
that is in our use form state, pass it along as a variable.

200
00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:27.250
And that, because they're named accordingly,

201
00:08:27.250 --> 00:08:31.690
that will then line up with these values right here.

202
00:08:31.690 --> 00:08:35.060
Which will in turn be set on the backend

203
00:08:35.060 --> 00:08:36.660
as these values right here.

204
00:08:36.660 --> 00:08:41.660
Now what gets returned from using mutation is two things.

205
00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:43.690
If we take a look at our...

206
00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:44.523
What was it?

207
00:08:44.523 --> 00:08:48.453
Was it products component here?

208
00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:52.970
No, it wasn't that one.

209
00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:54.140
It was...

210
00:08:55.370 --> 00:08:57.240
It was indexjs,

211
00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:59.500
which uses this one.

212
00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:01.033
And we'll open up the default.

213
00:09:02.350 --> 00:09:03.740
And then we have our all proudest query.

214
00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:04.600
If we look at this one.

215
00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:05.750
This is a query, right?

216
00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:07.730
And what gets returned from use query,

217
00:09:07.730 --> 00:09:10.930
we get the data, we get the error, and we get the loading.

218
00:09:10.930 --> 00:09:13.050
Now we're gonna get all three of those things

219
00:09:13.050 --> 00:09:17.260
as well from use mutation, but we get another value

220
00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:19.530
which is the actual function

221
00:09:19.530 --> 00:09:22.430
that will fire off the mutation, right?

222
00:09:22.430 --> 00:09:24.870
So we'll go here and take this payload

223
00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:26.800
and we're going to destructure it.

224
00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:28.800
And it's an array that it returns.

225
00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:31.600
The first thing that it returns is

226
00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:35.930
create product.

227
00:09:35.930 --> 00:09:37.320
So the first thing that returns

228
00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:40.660
is the actual function that will run the mutation.

229
00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:42.560
And then the second thing that it returns

230
00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:45.270
is the same thing as the query.

231
00:09:45.270 --> 00:09:48.960
We can have our loading state, our error state,

232
00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:53.490
and any data that gets returned from the mutation.

233
00:09:53.490 --> 00:09:58.290
So if we were to just console.log

234
00:10:00.010 --> 00:10:01.960
the create product, we should see...

235
00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:03.040
There we go,

236
00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:05.120
function, run mutation, right?

237
00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:09.790
This is a function that is bound to this whole mutation.

238
00:10:09.790 --> 00:10:13.770
And when we run that sucker with the arguments

239
00:10:13.770 --> 00:10:16.970
it will go off to the backend and run it for us.

240
00:10:16.970 --> 00:10:18.700
Now it's an asynchronous function.

241
00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:22.470
So we can then call it in our onsubmit function.

242
00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:24.900
So let's go into this onsubmit.

243
00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:28.133
First thing we need to do is we need to mark it as async,

244
00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:34.720
and that will allow us to await this thing.

245
00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:37.430
So it goes back to the backend then comes back.

246
00:10:37.430 --> 00:10:38.820
And well, we can do this.

247
00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:43.820
We'll say, submit the input fields to the backend.

248
00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:45.530
So it's a const.

249
00:10:45.530 --> 00:10:48.390
Response is equal to await create product.

250
00:10:48.390 --> 00:10:51.500
Now here's something important.

251
00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:54.200
This create product mutation function,

252
00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:57.907
we have already preloaded it with our variables

253
00:10:57.907 --> 00:11:02.300
and that is aware of that it's state and that it updates.

254
00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:05.370
So you can either specify the variables

255
00:11:05.370 --> 00:11:06.990
when you define the mutation,

256
00:11:06.990 --> 00:11:09.000
if you know what they are at the time.

257
00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.507
In our case we know that it's inputs.

258
00:11:11.507 --> 00:11:15.140
However, you can also pass them right here

259
00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:15.973
if you don't know them.

260
00:11:15.973 --> 00:11:18.490
If you only know them at the time of submit

261
00:11:18.490 --> 00:11:21.320
you can pass the variables right here.

262
00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:22.680
And we could say, inputs.

263
00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:24.280
Both work.

264
00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:27.280
If you know them at the time of definition

265
00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:30.180
then I like to stick them in the create product.

266
00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:32.930
And that just keeps our little submit function

267
00:11:32.930 --> 00:11:34.800
nice and tidy.

268
00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:38.890
So we'll go here, console.log, the response.

269
00:11:38.890 --> 00:11:42.320
And the other things that we wanna do up here

270
00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:45.510
is the loading state and the error state.

271
00:11:45.510 --> 00:11:47.390
So before we even submit anything

272
00:11:47.390 --> 00:11:49.100
let's take care of those as well.

273
00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:51.510
So we'll go to this field set here

274
00:11:51.510 --> 00:11:55.240
and we'll say, disabled is equal to loading, right?

275
00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:56.890
So if it is in loading state,

276
00:11:56.890 --> 00:11:59.920
then go ahead and disable the entire form.

277
00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:01.530
And then we, what was that other one?

278
00:12:01.530 --> 00:12:05.640
Aria-busy is also going to be equal to loading.

279
00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:07.850
So when we are in a loading state,

280
00:12:07.850 --> 00:12:10.480
show them the little swoopy bar,

281
00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:12.640
this thing will start moving,

282
00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:14.720
and also disable all the form input.

283
00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:16.930
So that takes care of our loading state.

284
00:12:16.930 --> 00:12:19.380
The other state we need to do is error state, right?

285
00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:22.040
If there's an error, we need to show the user.

286
00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:25.043
So I've actually given you an error component here.

287
00:12:25.990 --> 00:12:29.110
And what it does is, it just takes in the error,

288
00:12:29.110 --> 00:12:31.580
checks what type of error there is,

289
00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:34.163
and then will display it off to the user.

290
00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:36.560
And we can use that

291
00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:39.640
wherever we want to show the actual error.

292
00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:42.700
So what we can do is, just right here above the field set,

293
00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:44.523
we just say, error.

294
00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:47.700
Which one is that?

295
00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:48.533
What did we..?

296
00:12:48.533 --> 00:12:49.810
Oh, it's error message.

297
00:12:49.810 --> 00:12:51.340
Error message

298
00:12:52.820 --> 00:12:54.020
We're gonna import that.

299
00:12:55.580 --> 00:12:57.993
Oh, it didn't, it's not coming along.

300
00:12:59.190 --> 00:13:00.440
Oh, you know why?

301
00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:01.833
It's called display error.

302
00:13:04.020 --> 00:13:05.650
It doesn't matter what you call it.

303
00:13:05.650 --> 00:13:07.850
But for auto-importing to work,

304
00:13:07.850 --> 00:13:10.300
whatever you named it in the default,

305
00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:12.100
it needs to be auto-imported as that.

306
00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:15.350
So that's another vote to using named exports

307
00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:17.690
because then you don't have little goof ups like that.

308
00:13:17.690 --> 00:13:22.140
And then you pass the error, prop as error.

309
00:13:22.140 --> 00:13:23.690
And I really liked this because

310
00:13:23.690 --> 00:13:26.090
there's no checking if there is an error

311
00:13:26.090 --> 00:13:27.490
then go ahead and render it.

312
00:13:27.490 --> 00:13:30.250
We simply render out the component, pass it the error.

313
00:13:30.250 --> 00:13:32.943
And then internally to this, it will check.

314
00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:34.960
Is there no error?

315
00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:37.680
Or is there no error message, then return null,

316
00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:40.293
and it'll just render out nothing, which is great.

317
00:13:41.290 --> 00:13:42.123
Okay.

318
00:13:42.123 --> 00:13:43.640
So we did a lot there.

319
00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:44.473
Let's see where we're at.

320
00:13:44.473 --> 00:13:46.780
I'm just going to give it a fresh...

321
00:13:46.780 --> 00:13:47.800
No errors?

322
00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:49.500
Come on!
That's amazing.

323
00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:54.340
Let's go ahead and upload the Yeti photo, coral Yeti.

324
00:13:55.870 --> 00:13:59.203
And these are the best coolers.

325
00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:02.230
Ready?

326
00:14:02.230 --> 00:14:03.220
Is it gonna work?

327
00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:04.140
Is it gonna work?

328
00:14:04.140 --> 00:14:05.130
Let's just double check.

329
00:14:05.130 --> 00:14:06.373
I'm console logging the response.

330
00:14:06.373 --> 00:14:08.020
Here we go.

331
00:14:08.020 --> 00:14:10.070
Boom.
You see it's disabled.

332
00:14:10.070 --> 00:14:11.640
Came back.
Okay.

333
00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:15.080
So a lot to unpack there.

334
00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:17.420
We disabled all the inputs.

335
00:14:17.420 --> 00:14:18.253
Good.

336
00:14:18.253 --> 00:14:20.200
That's because we did the field set.

337
00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:22.970
This little swoopy guy started turning.

338
00:14:22.970 --> 00:14:23.970
I don't, what do you call that?

339
00:14:23.970 --> 00:14:26.040
The loading indicator turned on.

340
00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:27.690
There you go.

341
00:14:27.690 --> 00:14:30.820
Then we awaited the create product.

342
00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:34.220
And then we came back with the response

343
00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:36.890
and we got this.

344
00:14:36.890 --> 00:14:40.300
Data, open it up, create product.

345
00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:42.250
And what came back?

346
00:14:42.250 --> 00:14:45.400
An ID, a name, and a price.

347
00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:48.523
So if we go into our backend here, refresh.

348
00:14:49.660 --> 00:14:50.683
There it is.

349
00:14:52.370 --> 00:14:54.180
And the image worked as well.

350
00:14:54.180 --> 00:14:57.180
We should also be able to go to product images

351
00:14:57.180 --> 00:14:58.300
and see, there it is.

352
00:14:58.300 --> 00:15:00.740
There's the coral Yeti that's actually showing up.

353
00:15:00.740 --> 00:15:02.110
And that's the first one that worked

354
00:15:02.110 --> 00:15:05.350
because the rest of them are having that display error.

355
00:15:05.350 --> 00:15:06.620
Which is not really a big issue.

356
00:15:06.620 --> 00:15:09.140
But look at that.

357
00:15:09.140 --> 00:15:10.720
It worked.

358
00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:12.670
Let's double check that that error state

359
00:15:12.670 --> 00:15:14.780
actually does work as well.

360
00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:16.730
So let's just delete the name,

361
00:15:16.730 --> 00:15:21.400
and name is required, and let's try to upload it.

362
00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:22.500
And when we submit it,

363
00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:24.583
it should not send a name to the backend.

364
00:15:26.340 --> 00:15:27.173
It says, "Shoot.

365
00:15:27.173 --> 00:15:30.730
You attempted to perform an invalid mutation."

366
00:15:30.730 --> 00:15:33.760
You probably will get better error messages.

367
00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:35.270
That doesn't specifically tell you

368
00:15:35.270 --> 00:15:37.180
what went wrong in that case.

369
00:15:37.180 --> 00:15:38.660
But in most cases it will give you

370
00:15:38.660 --> 00:15:40.970
a bit of a better error message.

371
00:15:40.970 --> 00:15:41.920
And that's awesome.

372
00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:43.930
I bet the Keystone error messages

373
00:15:43.930 --> 00:15:45.740
will get a little bit better over time as well.

374
00:15:45.740 --> 00:15:50.430
But that just shows that we did indeed catch the error

375
00:15:50.430 --> 00:15:53.010
and we are displaying it to the user.

376
00:15:53.010 --> 00:15:55.560
Let's put that back so we don't screw it up,

377
00:15:55.560 --> 00:15:57.313
there we go, there's our name.

378
00:15:58.360 --> 00:16:00.400
Now, a couple other things.

379
00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:05.260
When it is successfully done,

380
00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:08.503
what we need to do is first we can just clear the form.

381
00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:14.172
An that should clear everything on out.

382
00:16:14.172 --> 00:16:16.683
Let's try upload something else now.

383
00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:23.193
Boom.

384
00:16:23.193 --> 00:16:25.610
So it came back and it cleared out all the inputs.

385
00:16:25.610 --> 00:16:26.443
That's great.

386
00:16:26.443 --> 00:16:27.640
Last thing I want to tell you is

387
00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:29.290
this response right here,

388
00:16:29.290 --> 00:16:32.930
when we console logged that response we had a data on it.

389
00:16:32.930 --> 00:16:36.360
We also would get an error and loading attribute on that.

390
00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:41.150
So the response that data is the same thing as this.

391
00:16:41.150 --> 00:16:45.550
So you can either capture it in a variable

392
00:16:45.550 --> 00:16:48.750
that is returned, or resolved, from this promise

393
00:16:48.750 --> 00:16:50.290
or you could just access it

394
00:16:50.290 --> 00:16:54.110
directly from this data attribute that is destructured.

395
00:16:54.110 --> 00:16:56.430
And that's kind of the nice thing about React,

396
00:16:56.430 --> 00:16:58.527
and Apollo in general, is that

397
00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:01.210
even though these were created

398
00:17:01.210 --> 00:17:03.600
long before somebody hit the submit button

399
00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:05.370
they are reactive variables,

400
00:17:05.370 --> 00:17:07.140
which allows us to always get

401
00:17:07.140 --> 00:17:09.950
the most up-to-date and latest information.

402
00:17:09.950 --> 00:17:13.440
So I'm going to take out the const response there.

403
00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:14.980
And we can simply just await it.

404
00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:16.610
And then, if we wanted to,

405
00:17:16.610 --> 00:17:20.330
we could log them out inside of this onsubmit handler.

406
00:17:20.330 --> 00:17:21.710
All right, so that's enough for that one.

407
00:17:21.710 --> 00:17:23.070
In the next one we'll have to do

408
00:17:23.070 --> 00:17:26.570
some refetching of our products queries

409
00:17:26.570 --> 00:17:29.070
so that we'll be able to see them on the homepage.
