00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:04.800
<v ->All right, let's code our sign in component.</v>

2
00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.375
So we're not gonna do it right at this page.

3
00:00:06.375 --> 00:00:07.570
And the reason behind that

4
00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:09.840
is because we want to in its own component.

5
00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.100
Because you can literally pop

6
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:13.050
this sign in component or whatever you want.

7
00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:15.420
Especially like if somebody is trying to access

8
00:00:17.086 --> 00:00:19.040
like a component that is restricted,

9
00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:20.880
they can only see it when they're signed in,

10
00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.510
then you can simply just see if the user's logged in.

11
00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:25.580
If not, render out the signing component

12
00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:28.680
otherwise render out the component

13
00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.840
that has privilege that you want to show them.

14
00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.640
So we'll go into our components here.

15
00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.330 line:15% 
And we'll make a new one called SignIn.js.

16
00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:38.670 line:15% 
Capital S, capital I.

17
00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.130
And we'll export default function SignIn().

18
00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:50.800
And we need a form that is going to allow us to

19
00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:53.800
get their username,

20
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:54.633
or the sorry,

21
00:00:54.633 --> 00:00:57.040
their email address and their password.

22
00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.573
So we've done this a couple of times.

23
00:01:02.325 --> 00:01:05.220
So feel free to skip ahead if you know how to do this

24
00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.620
or maybe this is a good example

25
00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:08.000
of when you can do it yourself.

26
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.660
But as always, I'll take you along for the ride.

27
00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:12.383
So we need a form.

28
00:01:12.383 --> 00:01:17.187
Take capital F because that is our styles that we have and,

29
00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:22.880
doesn't look like it's in here.

30
00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.880
So what we'll do is we'll import Form from'./styles/Form'.

31
00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.840
And here let's give it a form and say,

32
00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:39.863
test.

33
00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.710
Then we'll try to use this sign in component

34
00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:47.263
on our sign in page.

35
00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:50.490
Now we've got to import that.

36
00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:52.393
Boom!

37
00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.970
Sign in. Nothing was returned from render.

38
00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:59.542
Oh, that's why my auto import wasn't working.

39
00:01:59.542 --> 00:02:00.770
(laughing) I always forget the return.

40
00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:01.603
There we go.

41
00:02:01.603 --> 00:02:02.863
So our test is showing up.

42
00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:04.873
Next,

43
00:02:04.873 --> 00:02:06.520
and this is this is very important.

44
00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:11.520
On our form tag, we need to put a method of post on it.

45
00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.770
And we normally don't do that.

46
00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:16.790
But I'll show you the reason behind it

47
00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:20.310
because if you have an input with the

48
00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:21.320
name

49
00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.410
of password

50
00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.160
and the type of password,

51
00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:28.810
you don't have to code this I'll just show you.

52
00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.693
Button type = "submit"&gt; Submit.

53
00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:35.690
Watch this, if I type in here

54
00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:38.680
and JavaScript for whatever reason is broken,

55
00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.570
and I go ahead and submit it,

56
00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:42.640
you see what happens in the URL bar.

57
00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.360
It puts the password in the URL bar.

58
00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.110
And then all of a sudden what you've done is,

59
00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:51.880
first, you've had a security issue with your user

60
00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:55.200
because now their password is in their browser history.

61
00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.130
And then second, that's security issue on your end

62
00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:03.520
because somewhere on your logs for your server

63
00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:04.743
it will say like,

64
00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:07.140
get whatever.

65
00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.830
Like that's the URL someone tried to request.

66
00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:12.110
And then you've got a problem

67
00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:14.930
because you have somebody's password

68
00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:17.762
in your logs on your server.

69
00:03:17.762 --> 00:03:20.130
And you should never know somebody's password.

70
00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:22.323
That should always be stayed as hash.

71
00:03:23.431 --> 00:03:27.617
So what will happen is you can just put a...

72
00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:30.400
what is it here?

73
00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.570
You can put a type of submit.

74
00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:33.653
Where did it go?

75
00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:37.549
Oh yeah, I didn't put it on yet.

76
00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:40.860
If you put a method of post,

77
00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:45.820
that will make sure that it doesn't go into the URL.

78
00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:46.730
You still gotta be careful

79
00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:49.180
that you don't log out the body of that request

80
00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:52.330
'cause it still will send it over to your server.

81
00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:56.960
But it won't put it in the URL, which is really important.

82
00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:58.730
Next up, what we need is

83
00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:01.900
a field set.

84
00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:06.600
And in that field set, we need a label for email.

85
00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:09.910
We need a label that says email.

86
00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:12.610
We need it input with the type of email.

87
00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:14.460
Everything is going to be email here.

88
00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:16.353
name = "email"

89
00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:22.880
placeholder = Your Email Address.

90
00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:32.160
autoComplete = "email" that will...

91
00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.810
Most browsers will take the type of email

92
00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:36.140
and try to auto complete it.

93
00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:38.370
But that doesn't hurt putting it in there.

94
00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:39.530
That way it tells the browser,

95
00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:41.440
hey, if you're trying to fill an auto complete,

96
00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:44.290
this is an email. This is an email field.

97
00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:48.059
And then we finally, I'm gonna comment this out,

98
00:04:48.059 --> 00:04:48.892
we need a value.

99
00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:51.600
And we need an

100
00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:55.050
onChange handler for that one.

101
00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:57.110
So that is looking good.

102
00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:58.950
Yeah, see if I focus it my one password

103
00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:00.340
is already trying to say,

104
00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:01.720
hey, I recognize this.

105
00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:05.003
I wonder if you take the email off, does it still do that?

106
00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:07.183
Yeah, it does.

107
00:05:07.183 --> 00:05:08.280
So it can detect it.

108
00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:09.753
But that never hurts.

109
00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:14.210
Then just copy that entire one

110
00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:16.660
and we're gonna do it for their password.

111
00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:19.410
So (humming a note)

112
00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:20.263
password.

113
00:05:21.672 --> 00:05:23.633
The label is password.

114
00:05:24.749 --> 00:05:25.582
The type is password,

115
00:05:25.582 --> 00:05:28.900
the name is password, the placeholder is...

116
00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:30.663
Do passwords have placeholders?

117
00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:36.730
Yeah, they do. Okay.

118
00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:39.110
And we need a value and an onchange.

119
00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:41.290
And then finally underneath that,

120
00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:45.260
we need a button with the type of submit

121
00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.423
and then it says Sign In.

122
00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:50.653
Beautiful, put a capital I on that.

123
00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:54.640
Okay, so that's our just our JSX.

124
00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:58.580
Now we need to be able to sync these values to state

125
00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:00.880
so that we can send the data

126
00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:05.020
to our sign in API once the user actually submits it.

127
00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:08.043
So we'll go up here and we'll say

128
00:06:08.043 --> 00:06:10.197
const {inputs, handleChange, resetForm} =

129
00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:17.590
you guessed it, useForm.

130
00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:19.820
And then we need to give it our defaults of emails

131
00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:23.303
of nothing and password is nothing as well.

132
00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:26.390
UseForm is not defined.

133
00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:27.473
We didn't import it.

134
00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:30.900
So import useForm from

135
00:06:35.824 --> 00:06:36.657
useForm.

136
00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:41.750
Okay. Now we can go ahead and update these values here.

137
00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:44.590
So the value= {inputs.email}

138
00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:48.963
and the onchange is going to be

139
00:06:49.838 --> 00:06:50.921
handleChange.

140
00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:55.560
We can put that in for the password as well

141
00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:58.700
and then just change email to password.

142
00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:00.993
Now, if I type into these fields here,

143
00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:03.693
they good.

144
00:07:03.693 --> 00:07:04.900
They now update.

145
00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:07.290
There's one little issue here.

146
00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:08.660
No, that's not still an issue.

147
00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:12.730
That was just a problem because I hadn't refreshed yet

148
00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:15.763
before we had hooked up the value in the onchange handlers.

149
00:07:17.158 --> 00:07:17.991
All right.

150
00:07:17.991 --> 00:07:19.091
So that's that so far.

151
00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:21.093
Next thing,

152
00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:23.240
we need is,

153
00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:25.460
Oh I guess we need a little &lt;h2&gt; tag here.

154
00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:28.599
This is Sign Into Your

155
00:07:28.599 --> 00:07:29.623
Account.

156
00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:36.600
When somebody submits the form,

157
00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:38.440
we need to send that data to an API.

158
00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:40.628
So we'll go to our form here and say,

159
00:07:40.628 --> 00:07:41.461
onSubmit=

160
00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:45.890
and we can either do this

161
00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:49.346
in line or define another function.

162
00:07:49.346 --> 00:07:50.920
Let's define another function.

163
00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:52.690
'Cause I showed you this way last time.

164
00:07:52.690 --> 00:07:54.200
So handleSubmit.

165
00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:57.090
Go up here and make a function called handleSubmit

166
00:07:57.090 --> 00:07:59.190
that takes in an event.

167
00:07:59.190 --> 00:08:01.653
First thing we'll do is e.preventDefault.

168
00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:05.223
That will stop the Form from submitting.

169
00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:12.510
And then we'll just log out inputs

170
00:08:12.510 --> 00:08:14.490
just to see what data we have.

171
00:08:14.490 --> 00:08:19.120
So if you type some stuff in here and submit it.

172
00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:21.373
Oh it's got to be a proper email address.

173
00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:23.513
There we go.

174
00:08:23.513 --> 00:08:26.320 line:15% 
We've get an object with the actual values in here.

175
00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:30.310 line:15% 
A couple of times I've had people

176
00:08:30.310 --> 00:08:33.100 line:15% 
email me saying that this is security issue

177
00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:35.913 line:15% 
because the password is in clear text.

178
00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:38.380 line:15% 
I hate to break it to you

179
00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:40.730 line:15% 
but that is how the browser works.

180
00:08:40.730 --> 00:08:42.950 line:15% 
If you ever have a password field

181
00:08:42.950 --> 00:08:44.800 line:15% 
and you want to know what's in it,

182
00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:46.810 line:15% 
you can simply just inspect it

183
00:08:46.810 --> 00:08:49.370 line:15% 
and change the type from password to text.

184
00:08:49.370 --> 00:08:51.620 line:15% 
And it will just display it in clear text.

185
00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:55.530 line:15% 
So the password is submitted over the wire

186
00:08:55.530 --> 00:08:59.110 line:15% 
or over the network, to your server in clear text.

187
00:08:59.110 --> 00:09:01.266 line:15% 
But then what happens is the server hashes it

188
00:09:01.266 --> 00:09:06.266 line:15% 
and compares it to what it has on file for its own hash.

189
00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:11.140 line:15% 
So that's how all passwords work on the internet.

190
00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:12.770 line:15% 
So that is totally fine.

191
00:09:12.770 --> 00:09:15.380 line:15% 
The thing that you might be concerned about is,

192
00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:18.470 line:15% 
okay we're sending my password in clear text

193
00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:20.090 line:15% 
over the network.

194
00:09:20.090 --> 00:09:23.860
And that's why we use HTTPS on our websites.

195
00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:27.130
And what HTTPS does is that

196
00:09:27.130 --> 00:09:29.960
when the client, which is the browser,

197
00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:33.810
and the server, which is the (laughing) server,

198
00:09:33.810 --> 00:09:35.870
when data goes between the client

199
00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:39.700
and the server, it goes over

200
00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:43.360
like your Wi-Fi router.

201
00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:45.560
It goes to your ISP.

202
00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:48.860
It goes through the US government.

203
00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:50.578
Who's going to sniff it.

204
00:09:50.578 --> 00:09:51.820
(chuckling) And I'm just joking about that.

205
00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:52.820
Well, maybe I'm not.

206
00:09:52.820 --> 00:09:57.820
But the idea is that the data coming from here to here,

207
00:09:58.150 --> 00:09:59.920
HTTPS make sure that that's encrypted.

208
00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:04.481
Meaning that anyone that could possibly sniff these packets

209
00:10:04.481 --> 00:10:07.410
along the way, they they'll just see something like this

210
00:10:07.410 --> 00:10:09.720
instead of your actual password.

211
00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:12.710
And that's the key there.

212
00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:14.993
That's why we use HTTPS on our website.

213
00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:21.350
Next, we need to, because we're logging out our inputs.

214
00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:24.760
Here what we need to do is send the email

215
00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:28.080
and password to the

216
00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:29.453
graphqlAPI.

217
00:10:30.370 --> 00:10:33.093
So we'll write a little query here.

218
00:10:35.175 --> 00:10:37.160
So const SIGNIN_MUTATION= gql.

219
00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:43.590
Import that.

220
00:10:43.590 --> 00:10:44.423
Boom!

221
00:10:44.423 --> 00:10:45.256
There it is.

222
00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:51.420
We'll have a mutation called SIGNIN_MUTATION.

223
00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:55.310
that takes in someone's email address which is a string

224
00:10:57.070 --> 00:10:58.330
and is required.

225
00:10:58.330 --> 00:11:00.690
And then it also takes in a password

226
00:11:02.508 --> 00:11:06.370
which is also a string that's required.

227
00:11:06.370 --> 00:11:09.130
Like you'll never want to call this mutation without

228
00:11:09.130 --> 00:11:11.623
both an email address and a password.

229
00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:16.030
Then, inside of that mutation, we call what it is

230
00:11:16.030 --> 00:11:19.210
on our graphqlAPI to log the user in.

231
00:11:19.210 --> 00:11:20.933
So if we go here,

232
00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:23.000
it will be

233
00:11:25.170 --> 00:11:26.083
user,

234
00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:31.160
it'll be authenticate,

235
00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:32.979
Oh no, it's a mutation.

236
00:11:32.979 --> 00:11:34.153
So we got to write mutation here.

237
00:11:35.550 --> 00:11:37.030
And that is going to be

238
00:11:38.438 --> 00:11:39.860
authenticateUserWithPassword.

239
00:11:39.860 --> 00:11:42.170
Let me take a look at our docs here.

240
00:11:42.170 --> 00:11:44.550
Search for authenticateUserWithPassword

241
00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:46.323
takes in an email and a password,

242
00:11:47.254 --> 00:11:48.087
and will return,

243
00:11:48.087 --> 00:11:49.591
ah, look at this!

244
00:11:49.591 --> 00:11:50.850
It's another union.

245
00:11:50.850 --> 00:11:53.710
It returns either,

246
00:11:53.710 --> 00:11:55.660
a UserAuthenticationWithPasswordFailure

247
00:11:59.170 --> 00:12:00.890
or it returns a success, right?

248
00:12:00.890 --> 00:12:03.400
So the result is going to be one of two things,

249
00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:07.440
a success response with a token and the user itself

250
00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:11.270
or it's going to be a failure response

251
00:12:11.270 --> 00:12:14.280
with a code and a message.

252
00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:15.483
So what we'll do here,

253
00:12:18.957 --> 00:12:21.910
is we'll say ...on User...

254
00:12:21.910 --> 00:12:24.133
I got a copy paste that. That's way too big.

255
00:12:26.336 --> 00:12:28.970
UserAuthenticationWithPasswordSuccess.

256
00:12:28.970 --> 00:12:32.380
If that happens, give me the item

257
00:12:32.380 --> 00:12:34.240
which is going to be a user again.

258
00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:36.530
Remember item could be anything.

259
00:12:36.530 --> 00:12:38.880
Could be a company in our case, it's obviously a user.

260
00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:41.060
So on the item,

261
00:12:41.060 --> 00:12:42.540
give me the ID,

262
00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:46.700
the email and the name of the currently logged in user.

263
00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:47.790
We're not actually gonna use this.

264
00:12:47.790 --> 00:12:49.295
I just want to show you

265
00:12:49.295 --> 00:12:51.220
that you can return the user from that.

266
00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:52.143
Then in here,

267
00:12:55.823 --> 00:12:57.600
we need to call that mutation.

268
00:12:57.600 --> 00:12:59.500
So let's set it up here.

269
00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:00.973
Up here, so we'll say

270
00:13:00.973 --> 00:13:03.430
const [sign In].

271
00:13:03.430 --> 00:13:05.630
That's the name of the mutation.

272
00:13:05.630 --> 00:13:08.983
And then also {error, loading}= useMutation.

273
00:13:12.580 --> 00:13:16.523
And you pass the name of the mutation.

274
00:13:16.523 --> 00:13:19.900
We also need to pass it, the username and the password.

275
00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:21.900
So those are passed as variables,

276
00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:24.660
which are stored in our inputs.

277
00:13:24.660 --> 00:13:27.163
And luckily those will map nicely to each other.

278
00:13:28.508 --> 00:13:32.170
And then we also want to refetch some queries.

279
00:13:32.170 --> 00:13:33.900
And what this will do is

280
00:13:36.284 --> 00:13:37.117
refetch,

281
00:13:40.460 --> 00:13:43.230
the currently logged in user.

282
00:13:43.230 --> 00:13:46.610
So refretchQueries, that's an array.

283
00:13:46.610 --> 00:13:49.627
Each query is an object and we say,

284
00:13:49.627 --> 00:13:51.780
Query: Current_ User_Query.

285
00:13:51.780 --> 00:13:53.410
Now I think that auto imported it.

286
00:13:53.410 --> 00:13:54.390
Yap.

287
00:13:54.390 --> 00:13:56.091
From our user.

288
00:13:56.091 --> 00:13:58.970
And that's exactly why we exported it from here

289
00:13:58.970 --> 00:13:59.880
because it will say, all right

290
00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:01.660
anywhere that you're using this query,

291
00:14:01.660 --> 00:14:03.040
let's just go back to the network

292
00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:06.460
and refetch that specific one.

293
00:14:06.460 --> 00:14:07.970
So give it a save.

294
00:14:07.970 --> 00:14:10.130
The reason why we're not just like updating it

295
00:14:10.130 --> 00:14:12.680
in the cache is because then we're going

296
00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:15.120
to get into querying the cart

297
00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:17.300
and orders and things like that.

298
00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:18.330
And I don't want to have

299
00:14:18.330 --> 00:14:20.610
to requery all of that every single time.

300
00:14:20.610 --> 00:14:21.743
In here, we simply can just tell it,

301
00:14:21.743 --> 00:14:23.860
all right. I did this query somewhere else.

302
00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:27.630
Go ahead and re fetch that for me, will you?

303
00:14:27.630 --> 00:14:31.810
Then this useMutation gives us back our sign in function

304
00:14:31.810 --> 00:14:33.540
so we can go in here.

305
00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:35.950
Let's actually mark this as async.

306
00:14:35.950 --> 00:14:39.200
And we can say const or not const.

307
00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:40.567
Await signin.

308
00:14:45.610 --> 00:14:48.230
And if you want to see what comes back from that sign in,

309
00:14:48.230 --> 00:14:51.913
you can store it in a variable and log it out.

310
00:14:56.130 --> 00:14:57.830
And we should see.

311
00:14:57.830 --> 00:15:01.393
So now if we go back, I'm going to sign in.

312
00:15:02.690 --> 00:15:07.170
Password is Wes Wes Wes. Go to my console. Clear it out.

313
00:15:07.170 --> 00:15:08.003
Sign in.

314
00:15:10.390 --> 00:15:11.720
Bit of an issue.

315
00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:15.517
Response not successful. Received a status code 400.

316
00:15:16.376 --> 00:15:17.209
Okay.

317
00:15:19.350 --> 00:15:21.180 line:15% 
Fragment can not be spread here

318
00:15:21.180 --> 00:15:23.970 line:15% 
as objects of type of mutation can never be

319
00:15:23.970 --> 00:15:28.520 line:15% 
of type UserAuthenticationWithPasswordSuccess.

320
00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:29.353
Why not?

321
00:15:31.284 --> 00:15:32.630
Oh, I see what we forgot.

322
00:15:32.630 --> 00:15:33.610
We forgot to actually run

323
00:15:33.610 --> 00:15:35.790
the name of the mutation here, right?

324
00:15:35.790 --> 00:15:38.700
Because we've got a variable.

325
00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:41.130
We defined what the mutation is.

326
00:15:41.130 --> 00:15:42.750
But we never actually called

327
00:15:44.492 --> 00:15:47.290
the authenticateUserWithPassword function here.

328
00:15:47.290 --> 00:15:48.980
So we've got to do that now.

329
00:15:48.980 --> 00:15:50.393
So authenticateUserWithPassword.

330
00:15:52.070 --> 00:15:55.963
Email is the email string.

331
00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:00.930
Password is the...

332
00:16:00.930 --> 00:16:01.970
Oops.

333
00:16:01.970 --> 00:16:04.533
Password is the password variable.

334
00:16:06.330 --> 00:16:07.633
And then,

335
00:16:08.770 --> 00:16:10.323
as a result of that,

336
00:16:13.144 --> 00:16:13.977
there we go.

337
00:16:14.990 --> 00:16:16.960
Some of this stuff seems a little repetitive

338
00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:19.013
and verbose to me sometimes.

339
00:16:21.170 --> 00:16:23.366
I think that's typed stuff in general.

340
00:16:23.366 --> 00:16:24.880
The same thing as with TypeScript.

341
00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:26.550
You're like, why, I have to type this again?

342
00:16:26.550 --> 00:16:28.759
This seems like a little bit much

343
00:16:28.759 --> 00:16:29.990
but definitely worth the hassle.

344
00:16:29.990 --> 00:16:33.200
Why? Because like, even though we broke it there,

345
00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:36.370
we got a really good error message back saying like,

346
00:16:36.370 --> 00:16:37.630
hey this is a thing,

347
00:16:37.630 --> 00:16:40.173
but you're not ever supposed to get that here.

348
00:16:41.350 --> 00:16:43.480
Something got goofed up when you did that.

349
00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:46.200
So now give it a save, refresh.

350
00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:47.400
Let's try sign in again.

351
00:16:53.386 --> 00:16:54.640
There we go.

352
00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:55.473 line:15% 
Look at that. Okay.

353
00:16:55.473 --> 00:16:58.907 line:15% 
Couple of things happen there, is we get the data.

354
00:16:58.907 --> 00:17:00.680 line:15% 
The authenticateUserWithPassword.

355
00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:03.050 line:15% 
I got the actual information about my account.

356
00:17:03.050 --> 00:17:03.883 line:15% 
Good.

357
00:17:03.883 --> 00:17:05.363 line:15% 
And then also look.

358
00:17:06.947 --> 00:17:11.533
The navigation changed immediately because we refetched

359
00:17:12.729 --> 00:17:16.200
that query and we are now logged in.

360
00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:19.570
And now the navigation has now changed

361
00:17:19.570 --> 00:17:21.180
and updated what it's in.

362
00:17:21.180 --> 00:17:25.190 line:15% 
We actually don't need this value right here.

363
00:17:25.190 --> 00:17:28.580
And if you ever wanted the data here

364
00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:31.140
somewhere else, you can also get it from here.

365
00:17:31.140 --> 00:17:33.328
That's what data is, right?

366
00:17:33.328 --> 00:17:34.161
There's two different ways.

367
00:17:34.161 --> 00:17:35.230
You can get it from the returned

368
00:17:35.230 --> 00:17:36.388
asynchronous function here,

369
00:17:36.388 --> 00:17:39.090
or you can restructure it from your mutation.

370
00:17:39.090 --> 00:17:40.790
In our case, we don't want either.

371
00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:46.740
We just simply just have to refresh the query

372
00:17:46.740 --> 00:17:47.800
and it will be apparent.

373
00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:51.610
One thing we do need to do is reset the form

374
00:17:51.610 --> 00:17:54.200
cause it needs to empty it on out.

375
00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:56.870
And then we also do need to account for errors.

376
00:17:56.870 --> 00:17:59.773
So let's just make sure that reset works.

377
00:18:05.270 --> 00:18:06.103
There we go.

378
00:18:06.103 --> 00:18:08.333
It worked. Now it is clear.

379
00:18:10.324 --> 00:18:12.140
We also need to account for errors.

380
00:18:12.140 --> 00:18:13.493
So if I do,

381
00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:16.680
something like that,

382
00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:17.573
sign in.

383
00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:21.350
Oh, we don't get an error there

384
00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:22.850
'cause I'm currently logged in.

385
00:18:22.850 --> 00:18:23.970
The way that you can

386
00:18:25.690 --> 00:18:26.725
sign out,

387
00:18:26.725 --> 00:18:28.150
because we don't have a sign out button yet.

388
00:18:28.150 --> 00:18:31.333
It's just close it and reopen a new incognito.

389
00:18:32.380 --> 00:18:34.397
And then we'll go wesbos@gmail.com

390
00:18:34.397 --> 00:18:35.983
and the password is no.

391
00:18:38.090 --> 00:18:38.933
Sign in.

392
00:18:40.420 --> 00:18:44.210 line:15% 
You see, we get a UserAuthenticationWithPasswordFailure.

393
00:18:44.210 --> 00:18:45.480
Okay.

394
00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:48.523
Is that information available in this error variable?

395
00:18:49.907 --> 00:18:51.810
Let's console.log it to see.

396
00:18:51.810 --> 00:18:53.470
So just pretty much anywhere.

397
00:18:53.470 --> 00:18:54.303
Log.

398
00:19:07.610 --> 00:19:09.020
It is undefined.

399
00:19:09.020 --> 00:19:11.760
Okay. So this is a bit of a weird thing

400
00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:13.350
is that

401
00:19:13.350 --> 00:19:16.170
the mutation

402
00:19:16.170 --> 00:19:18.340
is successfully erroring.

403
00:19:18.340 --> 00:19:23.340
Meaning that this mutation, even though it comes back,

404
00:19:23.870 --> 00:19:25.320
it's successfully erroring

405
00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:28.090
and we're not actually logged in.

406
00:19:28.090 --> 00:19:32.550
So what we need to do is to capture that error

407
00:19:32.550 --> 00:19:35.193
and pass it to an error component.

408
00:19:36.130 --> 00:19:40.250
So what we'll do here, is we need to de structure

409
00:19:40.250 --> 00:19:42.000
that data value here.

410
00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.160
We need to go up here

411
00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:46.960
and query the actual information about the error.

412
00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:50.650
So let's take a look at what we got here.

413
00:19:50.650 --> 00:19:51.870
UserAuthentication

414
00:19:54.680 --> 00:19:55.680
WithPasswordFailure.

415
00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:00.550
So go here say, ... on

416
00:20:01.810 --> 00:20:02.920
the failure.

417
00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:06.154
Then we want the code

418
00:20:06.154 --> 00:20:08.510
and the message.

419
00:20:08.510 --> 00:20:11.403
So say, code. The message.

420
00:20:15.890 --> 00:20:17.870
And now let's try to console.log the error

421
00:20:17.870 --> 00:20:19.420
to see what we're working with.

422
00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:30.547 line:15% 
There it is. Data.

423
00:20:30.547 --> 00:20:33.130 line:15% 
UserAuthenticationWithPassword.

424
00:20:33.130 --> 00:20:34.870 line:15% 
And the type name is...

425
00:20:34.870 --> 00:20:35.840 line:15% 
IDENTITY_NOT_FOUND.

426
00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:38.960 line:15% 
The email value provided isn't identifying any of the users.

427
00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:43.753
So what we can do is we'll get our error component.

428
00:20:48.901 --> 00:20:50.633
And we'll do it right here.

429
00:20:56.550 --> 00:21:01.337
error={data?.authenticateUserWithPassword}.

430
00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:09.403
Let's copy paste that. These are some long strings.

431
00:21:15.527 --> 00:21:16.360
.Failure.

432
00:21:18.370 --> 00:21:20.110
I love using these question marks

433
00:21:20.110 --> 00:21:24.200
because this error component won't render out anything

434
00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:28.550
unless this entire nested property is actually a thing.

435
00:21:28.550 --> 00:21:30.600
So we need to import our error component.

436
00:21:32.510 --> 00:21:33.657
So, import Error from

437
00:21:38.927 --> 00:21:40.094
error message.

438
00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:43.233
Let's see if it works now.

439
00:21:50.370 --> 00:21:51.861
Didn't work. Why not?

440
00:21:51.861 --> 00:21:54.730
Let's try it with a manual error here.

441
00:21:54.730 --> 00:21:59.160
So the error could be just something

442
00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:02.263
with a message that says, ahhhhhhhhh.

443
00:22:03.810 --> 00:22:06.100
Okay. So if we pass it an object

444
00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:07.590
with an error message on it,

445
00:22:07.590 --> 00:22:09.970
it says, shoot! Ahhhhhhh.

446
00:22:09.970 --> 00:22:11.783
But, if we pass it,

447
00:22:14.710 --> 00:22:17.149
UserAuthenticationWithPasswordFailure.

448
00:22:17.149 --> 00:22:18.570
Ah, is it a capital?

449
00:22:18.570 --> 00:22:19.853
Is it the capital?

450
00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:22.560
Let's look at our docs here.

451
00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:25.420
This is where something like TypeScript would really help us

452
00:22:25.420 --> 00:22:28.220
because it would immediately say,

453
00:22:28.220 --> 00:22:31.120
hey, that's not a possible property on there.

454
00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:32.663
So let's take a look here.

455
00:22:36.470 --> 00:22:37.880
Don't see it as a capital U.

456
00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:38.963
I bet it's not.

457
00:22:40.470 --> 00:22:42.910
Let's just try it with a lowercase U.

458
00:22:42.910 --> 00:22:45.660
So not@not. Not.

459
00:22:45.660 --> 00:22:46.543
Sign in.

460
00:22:49.421 --> 00:22:50.300 line:15% 
No! Okay.

461
00:22:50.300 --> 00:22:51.683 line:15% 
Let's look at it here.

462
00:22:52.704 --> 00:22:53.537 line:15% 
Oh, I see the issue.

463
00:22:53.537 --> 00:22:55.460 line:15% 
It's data.authenticateUserWithPassword.

464
00:22:56.670 --> 00:22:59.483 line:15% 
And then we have to say, it's the type name.

465
00:23:00.670 --> 00:23:02.033 line:15% 
I see.

466
00:23:04.220 --> 00:23:05.970
So what we'll do here is we'll say,

467
00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:09.113
the error is that.

468
00:23:10.540 --> 00:23:11.453
And,

469
00:23:12.300 --> 00:23:14.140
we'll go up here and make a little variable.

470
00:23:14.140 --> 00:23:16.610
Say const error =

471
00:23:16.610 --> 00:23:19.460
We can stop de-structuring this because we don't need it.

472
00:23:20.850 --> 00:23:22.583
We don't lock to console.log it.

473
00:23:23.570 --> 00:23:25.083
And right here we'll say,

474
00:23:27.725 --> 00:23:31.620 line:15% 
the error = data?authenticatedUserWithPassword._ _typename

475
00:23:43.487 --> 00:23:44.987
===

476
00:23:47.070 --> 00:23:48.163
that type.

477
00:23:50.790 --> 00:23:53.053
If that is true, then,

478
00:23:58.590 --> 00:24:00.350
will return that.

479
00:24:00.350 --> 00:24:04.533
Otherwise will return undefined because there is no error.

480
00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:10.093
Oh, these are backwards. Excuse me here.

481
00:24:11.610 --> 00:24:13.240
Hoo! Okay, that was a big one.

482
00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:15.300
Let me catch you up if he got lost there.

483
00:24:15.300 --> 00:24:19.100
The error is equal to the response

484
00:24:19.100 --> 00:24:22.950
but only when the response's type name is this.

485
00:24:22.950 --> 00:24:23.840
It's a little bit weird

486
00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:26.021
that they don't throw like a 400 network error

487
00:24:26.021 --> 00:24:28.680
because then a regular error component would work.

488
00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:32.210
But that's the case here successfully errored.

489
00:24:32.210 --> 00:24:34.170
If that is true,

490
00:24:34.170 --> 00:24:37.110
then we return the response which is an error.

491
00:24:37.110 --> 00:24:38.740
Otherwise we return nothing.

492
00:24:38.740 --> 00:24:40.980
And then we can go into our error component

493
00:24:40.980 --> 00:24:42.853
and simply just pass that value.

494
00:24:45.378 --> 00:24:47.329
I bet that will work, hopefully.

495
00:24:47.329 --> 00:24:49.020
(Wes laughing)

496
00:24:49.020 --> 00:24:52.090
There we go. Sign in. Boom! There we go.

497
00:24:52.090 --> 00:24:55.040
Shoot! The value provided didn't identify any of its users.

498
00:24:56.420 --> 00:24:57.768
Last thing, some people think that this is

499
00:24:57.768 --> 00:25:00.830
a bit of a security issue telling somebody.

500
00:25:00.830 --> 00:25:01.920
Like someone could come here

501
00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:03.920
and check if anyone has an account.

502
00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:06.718
And if this was like a sensitive website,

503
00:25:06.718 --> 00:25:08.750
like a dating website or something like that,

504
00:25:08.750 --> 00:25:11.590
you would be able to tell if somebody has an account

505
00:25:11.590 --> 00:25:12.470
on that with that.

506
00:25:12.470 --> 00:25:14.720
So there is a setting in keystone

507
00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:16.650
where you can simply just turn that off.

508
00:25:16.650 --> 00:25:19.100
I honestly don't think it's that big of a deal

509
00:25:19.100 --> 00:25:21.730
because it's a street wear website

510
00:25:21.730 --> 00:25:23.720
and not a dating website.

511
00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:24.950
So, there's that one.

512
00:25:24.950 --> 00:25:26.430
That's the sign in component.

513
00:25:26.430 --> 00:25:27.430
And the next one

514
00:25:27.430 --> 00:25:31.993
we will code a sign out and a sign up component.
