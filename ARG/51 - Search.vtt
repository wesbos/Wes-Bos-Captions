00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.109
(tone booms)

2
00:00:01.109 --> 00:00:02.310
<v Wes>All right now, we're gonna be working</v>

3
00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:04.820
on the search component that goes up here.

4
00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:08.790
And it's sort of a mix between search, lazy searching

5
00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.590
and like a dropdown autocomplete.

6
00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:14.580
We're also gonna be using this library called downshift-js

7
00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.490
for this, which makes doing these dropdown types

8
00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.633
super easy and accessible.

9
00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:24.100
So let's go in, make a brand new component.

10
00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:26.583
Let's call that Search.js.

11
00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:30.960
And then inside of here,

12
00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.960
we will export default function Search.

13
00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:39.150
And then from that, we're going to return

14
00:00:43.226 --> 00:00:44.309
SearchStyles.

15
00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.653
And we'll try to import that one.

16
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.960
Let's see what we can do here.

17
00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.880
No, we're gonna import the SearchStyles directly,

18
00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:57.350
SearchStyles from,

19
00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:01.760
and it's in the styles directory, forward slash, DropDown

20
00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.340
is where those styles are gonna live.

21
00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:07.083
It looks like this accidentally auto closed.

22
00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:08.783
There we go.

23
00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.223
And inside of there, just putting a paragraph that says hey.

24
00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:16.900
And we'll go into our header.js

25
00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.530
and we'll find where we have that div

26
00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:21.820
with a class of sub-bar.

27
00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:23.050
We have our Search.

28
00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:25.820
We can replace it with an actual Search component

29
00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.180
and then go ahead and import that

30
00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:30.210
from the file that we have, okay cool.

31
00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.720
Next we need a little bit more markup here.

32
00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.200
So we'll have a div here.

33
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.050
And then inside of that, we want an input with the...

34
00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:41.730
Actually we're not gonna put any,

35
00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:42.930
we'll put type of search on it,

36
00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.700
but we're going to come back in just a second

37
00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.890
and switch how these are passed to it.

38
00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:49.020
And then below that,

39
00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.970
we're going to have a DropDown component.

40
00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:56.410
And that can be imported from component styles/dropdown.

41
00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:58.230
You see that automatically got imported there.

42
00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:59.653
That one worked just fine.

43
00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.977
Inside of the DropDown, we're gonna have DropDownItem.

44
00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.010
And that was gonna be each search result that comes back.

45
00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:09.520
And you can import that one

46
00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.590
from your styles directory as well.

47
00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:13.430
And then inside of there just say, Hey.

48
00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:14.520
Give yourself a couple of them

49
00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.740
just so we can see what we're working with, okay cool.

50
00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:21.530
So look, this is the base render

51
00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.570
of all the the divs and everything that we want.

52
00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:28.050
And now when we wanna add in the functionality,

53
00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.380
we're going to be reaching for a library called Downshift

54
00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.500
which makes doing this sort of dropdown,

55
00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.050
auto-complete stuff really easily,

56
00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:36.900
but most important, really accessible.

57
00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:37.917
'Cause you might think like,

58
00:02:37.917 --> 00:02:39.050
oh, it's not that big of a deal.

59
00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:40.700
Just listen for the down and up arrows

60
00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:41.650
and a click and you're done,

61
00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:46.090
but making these sort of dropdowns accessible for keyboards

62
00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:47.500
is really difficult.

63
00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.270
So that's why we use a third-party package for it.

64
00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:53.780
So we'll go right above this return here.

65
00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.540
And this is going to be a little bit big

66
00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:57.780
but we're gonna add the pieces

67
00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:01.820
as we need them from downshift.

68
00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:02.873
So let's say const,

69
00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.820
curly brackets, getMenuProps,

70
00:03:11.815 --> 00:03:14.315
getInputProps, and getCombobox

71
00:03:21.352 --> 00:03:23.610
oh, lowercase box, Props.

72
00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:26.313
And that is going to be useCombobox.

73
00:03:30.086 --> 00:03:33.380
And that is a method that lives in downshift.

74
00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:36.870
We'll have to import useCombobox from downshift.

75
00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:38.580
Boom, there we go.

76
00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:40.540
And then a bunch of arguments

77
00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:44.890
that get passed to useCombobox is one object.

78
00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:49.890
And inside of that, it takes a number of different options.

79
00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.690
First, is the items which,

80
00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:55.100
it will be an empty array right now.

81
00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:58.917
Second one is going to be onInputValueChange.

82
00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:05.963
And that will just be console.log Input changed.

83
00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:10.825
Next one will be onSelectedItemChange.

84
00:04:10.825 --> 00:04:14.197
And we'll just console.log Selected Item changed.

85
00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:19.650
So this is gonna fire when somebody types into the box,

86
00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:20.790
this is gonna fire

87
00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:23.810
when somebody selects an item from the dropdown,

88
00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:28.010
meaning they wish to go to that page for that specific item.

89
00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:30.040
So I think that's the very basics

90
00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:32.500
that we can get this up and running.

91
00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:33.500
Then what we'll do

92
00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:37.260
is we'll take these methods that we just created here

93
00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:38.880
and we have to spread them

94
00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:41.510
into the different elements on there.

95
00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:44.260
And these are what make all of this stuff

96
00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.730
keyboard-accessible without us having to worry

97
00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:49.320
about listening for keyup and keydown

98
00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:52.160
and ARIA attributes and all that.

99
00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:55.370
So this right here is going to be curly brackets,

100
00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:56.683
...getComboboxProps,

101
00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:01.381
and it's gonna add a bunch of stuff to that.

102
00:05:01.381 --> 00:05:05.700
The input in here, we can take this type of search out,

103
00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:07.250
is going to be ...getInputProps

104
00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:12.300
and then any additional options

105
00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:15.880
which you wish to pass to your input can go in here.

106
00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:19.750
So type search, that's gonna be the type.

107
00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:24.703
placeholder is going to be Search for an Item.

108
00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:28.400
The id is search.

109
00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:33.400
And className is going to be loading.

110
00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:37.390
And we will have to programmatically turn that on and off

111
00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:39.240
once we actually have our query.

112
00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:42.443
But that should be enough for now.

113
00:05:42.443 --> 00:05:44.010
If I give this a refresh,

114
00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:45.530
let's double check if there's any errors.

115
00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:47.260
Yeah this is one error we get,

116
00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.130
aria-controls did not match.

117
00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:53.160
Server gave us downshift-3, Client gave us downshift-0.

118
00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:54.590
So what's wrong in that case?

119
00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:57.920
So what happens is that Downshift accounts

120
00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:00.400
for having multiples on the page

121
00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:04.020
and it will try to assign unique identifiers to each one.

122
00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:05.860
And sometimes what the server renders

123
00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:08.220
and what the client renders is off.

124
00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:11.300
So there's a very simple fix for that

125
00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:14.350
is we'll just go to the very top of this

126
00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:16.323
and just say resetIdCounter.

127
00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:22.170
And that is a method that is imported from downshift.

128
00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:25.630
And then that takes care of any server side rendering issues

129
00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:27.230
that you might have.

130
00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:28.360
I'll give that a refresh.

131
00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:29.580
There we go.

132
00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:30.520
Now we get one more thing.

133
00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:32.070
You forgot to call getMenuProps.

134
00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:33.720
This is why I really like this library.

135
00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:36.890
'Cause like when it gives you errors that like,

136
00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:39.120
oh you forgot to do this, you silly goose.

137
00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:41.581
Then you're like, oh, I did forget to do that.

138
00:06:41.581 --> 00:06:43.690
And that will go on the DropDown here.

139
00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:46.833
So your curly brackets, ...getMenuProps.

140
00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:49.830
And give it a refresh.

141
00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:52.050
Make sure there's no other errors that are happening.

142
00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:53.080
Okay, cool.

143
00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:55.123
Next thing we need to do is actually write a query

144
00:06:55.123 --> 00:06:59.140
that will find the items from our GraphQL API

145
00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:01.960
as the user searches for them.

146
00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:04.670
So you guessed it, we're gonna write a query

147
00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:06.050
for all the items that we want.

148
00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:11.050
So const SEARCH_PRODUCTS_QUERY = gql.

149
00:07:13.506 --> 00:07:16.760
We'll import gql from graphql-tag.

150
00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:21.200
And the query will be called

151
00:07:23.255 --> 00:07:25.370
SEARCH_PRODUCTS_QUERY, takes in a variable.

152
00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:27.120
We'll call that searchTerm.

153
00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:29.850
And that will be a String.

154
00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:31.730
And you have to pass it a String

155
00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:33.800
if you wanna be able to use that.

156
00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:34.990
All right, and the query

157
00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:37.950
that we call against our Keystone GraphQL API

158
00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:39.523
is called allProducts.

159
00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:42.600
And if you ever wanna rename,

160
00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:44.310
you know, like when you get the data back,

161
00:07:44.310 --> 00:07:45.989
it's like data.allProducts.

162
00:07:45.989 --> 00:07:47.180
If you ever wanna rename that,

163
00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:49.420
you could do something like this, searchTerms,

164
00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:52.120
and it will search for all products

165
00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:55.400
but it will put the data in a property called searchTerms.

166
00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:56.440
So I'm gonna put that on there

167
00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:59.010
just to show you how you can rename it.

168
00:07:59.010 --> 00:08:00.030
That's especially helpful

169
00:08:00.030 --> 00:08:03.420
is if you were doing multiple searches,

170
00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:05.390
like I wanna search for all products

171
00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:08.330
that have a title of yeti.

172
00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:11.970
But then I also want to search for all products

173
00:08:11.970 --> 00:08:14.032
that have a title of shoes, right?

174
00:08:14.032 --> 00:08:17.120
And in that case, you'd be overlapping all products.

175
00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:20.930
So we could rename one to shoes and one to yeti

176
00:08:20.930 --> 00:08:23.170
and that way it would work, no problem.

177
00:08:23.170 --> 00:08:25.530
But in our case, we just need that one.

178
00:08:25.530 --> 00:08:27.020
So we have allProducts.

179
00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:28.730
And then from that,

180
00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:32.582
we want to return the id of the product that comes back,

181
00:08:32.582 --> 00:08:34.810
the name of the product that comes back,

182
00:08:34.810 --> 00:08:38.703
the photo with an image with the publicUrlTransformed.

183
00:08:43.810 --> 00:08:45.530
Now the important part

184
00:08:45.530 --> 00:08:48.370
is what we pass to all products right here, right?

185
00:08:48.370 --> 00:08:53.030
We wanna be able to query items based on the search term.

186
00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:57.053
So what we can do is inside of here, we'll say where.

187
00:08:58.310 --> 00:09:01.770
And we wanna check if the name or the description

188
00:09:01.770 --> 00:09:03.910
matches our actual items.

189
00:09:03.910 --> 00:09:06.880
And if we go to our GraphQL API right here,

190
00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:09.200
let me just show you a quick example.

191
00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:12.170
We could for sure, just query allProducts

192
00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:15.940
and we want the id and the name.

193
00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:17.120
Let's just show you that.

194
00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:19.060
Boom, that gives you all the products, right?

195
00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:21.050
And then, or you could go inside of here.

196
00:09:21.050 --> 00:09:22.453
You could say where,

197
00:09:26.811 --> 00:09:27.644
the name.

198
00:09:27.644 --> 00:09:31.200
And look at this, name_not_in, not in i, name_contains,

199
00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:32.390
name_ends_with, names_starts_with.

200
00:09:32.390 --> 00:09:36.209
They have all these different options that we have in here

201
00:09:36.209 --> 00:09:38.263
which is really cool.

202
00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:44.540
In our case we will do name_contains.

203
00:09:44.540 --> 00:09:46.920
And then _i means insensitive.

204
00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:49.780
So if someone searches for uppercase Yeti,

205
00:09:49.780 --> 00:09:52.970
and we're a lowercase yeti, it will still return it.

206
00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:55.440
So we could do something like this.

207
00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:57.090
Oh, you got to use double quotes.

208
00:10:01.130 --> 00:10:02.020
Okay so there we go.

209
00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:04.080
That gives us a subset of it.

210
00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:05.420
But what if we wanna search

211
00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:08.150
for the name and the description?

212
00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:11.660
Well, in that case, we give ourselves an OR.

213
00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:15.400
And you can give it an array of multiples of those.

214
00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:18.030
So OR, name.

215
00:10:18.030 --> 00:10:19.130
What was it?

216
00:10:19.130 --> 00:10:21.330
Oh, each one is an object.

217
00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:23.243
OR name_contains_i

218
00:10:27.250 --> 00:10:28.083
yeti.

219
00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:34.653
Or another one is going to be a different field, right?

220
00:10:35.738 --> 00:10:40.738
description_contains_i yeti.

221
00:10:42.070 --> 00:10:43.930
And I don't think that will change anything

222
00:10:43.930 --> 00:10:45.340
but you could run that.

223
00:10:45.340 --> 00:10:47.390
But you could also say like, shoes,

224
00:10:47.390 --> 00:10:49.340
you could do something totally different here

225
00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:51.940
and that will return multiple items from it.

226
00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:54.210
Oh, it's not working 'cause I've, again,

227
00:10:54.210 --> 00:10:56.790
I always use double quotes in GraphQL or single quotes,

228
00:10:56.790 --> 00:10:59.970
but single quotes do not work in GraphQL,

229
00:10:59.970 --> 00:11:02.020
only double quotes.

230
00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:04.147
There we go, run, boom.

231
00:11:04.147 --> 00:11:04.980
And you look here,

232
00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:08.420
you get a mix of shoes and Yeti coolers back.

233
00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:11.340
So we'll go back here and we'll say,

234
00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:15.170
give me all the products where, OR

235
00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:18.443
the name_contains_i

236
00:11:21.070 --> 00:11:23.523
is equal to the search term.

237
00:11:27.062 --> 00:11:30.867
And then we'll duplicate that and make this description.

238
00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:35.810
So give me all the products where one of these

239
00:11:35.810 --> 00:11:38.500
and similarly there also is AND,

240
00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:40.750
and you can nest them as far as you want

241
00:11:40.750 --> 00:11:42.580
to make some pretty complicated queries.

242
00:11:42.580 --> 00:11:46.125
Just remember that there is a database underneath here.

243
00:11:46.125 --> 00:11:50.387
Sometimes people, they think GraphQL is the query layer

244
00:11:50.387 --> 00:11:54.570
but these will be eventually converted

245
00:11:54.570 --> 00:11:58.950
to Postgres or MongoDB or MySQL queries.

246
00:11:58.950 --> 00:12:00.630
So you can't...

247
00:12:00.630 --> 00:12:02.810
The more complicated you get with your queries,

248
00:12:02.810 --> 00:12:06.560
the more time it's going to take in order to run those.

249
00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:09.790
So now we have this query right here.

250
00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:13.110
And normally we would fire off this query

251
00:12:13.110 --> 00:12:14.090
on page load, right?

252
00:12:14.090 --> 00:12:18.510
We will go inside of our function here or component

253
00:12:18.510 --> 00:12:19.900
and run useQuery.

254
00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:24.000
But we don't want it to fire off on component render,

255
00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.300
We want this to fire off when we want, right?

256
00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:28.590
Kind of like a mutation,

257
00:12:28.590 --> 00:12:30.310
we can call it whenever we want.

258
00:12:30.310 --> 00:12:33.100
But this is not a mutation, it's a query.

259
00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:37.737
So what we do in that case is we use useLazyQuery.

260
00:12:39.330 --> 00:12:41.183
So let's go to the very top here.

261
00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:47.040
const findItems and loading, data

262
00:12:48.150 --> 00:12:50.760
and error = useLazyQuery.

263
00:12:53.770 --> 00:12:58.260
And that is imported right from Apollo client,

264
00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:00.973
just like we would use a query or use a mutation.

265
00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:08.200
And the query that we run is called SEARCH_PRODUCTS_QUERY.

266
00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:10.350
That's the one that we just wrote.

267
00:13:10.350 --> 00:13:14.620
And there is one option we need to pass here.

268
00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:16.890
And that is called the fetchPolicy.

269
00:13:16.890 --> 00:13:19.800
That is gonna be set to no-cache.

270
00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:21.160
And what that will do

271
00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:25.530
is it's going to entirely bypass the Apollo cache

272
00:13:25.530 --> 00:13:27.640
and always go to the network.

273
00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:30.040
And that's because we don't wanna be storing

274
00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:32.270
or caching any of these results.

275
00:13:32.270 --> 00:13:34.150
We just wanna go directly to the network.

276
00:13:34.150 --> 00:13:37.230
And there also is a bit of a problem

277
00:13:37.230 --> 00:13:41.330
because if we did not go directly to the network,

278
00:13:41.330 --> 00:13:43.870
it would try to pull them from the cache.

279
00:13:43.870 --> 00:13:45.950
And then in our case, it would just be showing

280
00:13:45.950 --> 00:13:47.470
whatever's on the current page,

281
00:13:47.470 --> 00:13:49.500
which is another issue I ran into

282
00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:51.320
when I was updating this thing for Apollo.

283
00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:52.410
But it makes sense

284
00:13:52.410 --> 00:13:54.540
that you'd totally go straight to the network,

285
00:13:54.540 --> 00:13:56.693
bypass the Apollo cache entirely.

286
00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:02.210
Okay so now that we have this findItems here,

287
00:14:02.210 --> 00:14:05.610
we can go ahead and start running this

288
00:14:05.610 --> 00:14:09.130
whenever somebody types into the box, right?

289
00:14:09.130 --> 00:14:11.790
So if we open up our DevTools here

290
00:14:11.790 --> 00:14:14.030
and you start to type in here,

291
00:14:14.030 --> 00:14:17.130
you'll see that you get Input changed

292
00:14:17.130 --> 00:14:18.610
happens 39 times, right?

293
00:14:18.610 --> 00:14:21.840
Every single time that I type in here,

294
00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:24.240
it's going to fire off an input change.

295
00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:28.330
And we could run findItems

296
00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:30.517
and we could actually fire off that findItems,

297
00:14:30.517 --> 00:14:33.510
But you could see that if I was searching for like...

298
00:14:33.510 --> 00:14:34.730
Let's clear this console here.

299
00:14:34.730 --> 00:14:36.653
If I was searching for yeti cooler,

300
00:14:38.030 --> 00:14:41.230
and I search in here and I say, I'm like backspace,

301
00:14:41.230 --> 00:14:42.660
yeti cooler, right?

302
00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:45.860
Like I just fired off 12 change events.

303
00:14:45.860 --> 00:14:49.060
That's gonna hit the network 12 times.

304
00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:53.520
That will very clearly DDoS your own system very quickly.

305
00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:58.300
So when something like that happens in JavaScript

306
00:14:58.300 --> 00:14:59.960
or in programming in general

307
00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:01.840
where you want it to fire off,

308
00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:05.410
but you don't want it to fire off that often,

309
00:15:05.410 --> 00:15:07.500
that's called debouncing a function.

310
00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:09.260
And then debouncing a function will say,

311
00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:12.700
yeah, fire off but like, hold on for a couple seconds

312
00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:15.520
and like see, maybe if we fired it

313
00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:18.670
six times within a second, wait for one second

314
00:15:18.670 --> 00:15:20.590
and then only fire it once

315
00:15:20.590 --> 00:15:22.840
after that one second has elapsed.

316
00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:25.290
So what we'll do is we'll take this findItems

317
00:15:25.290 --> 00:15:28.020
and we'll make it into a debounce function

318
00:15:28.020 --> 00:15:29.270
called findItemsButChill.

319
00:15:30.472 --> 00:15:32.307
So const findItemsButChill = to debounce.

320
00:15:40.180 --> 00:15:42.190
And debounce is a function

321
00:15:42.190 --> 00:15:45.920
that needs to be imported from lodash.

322
00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:48.962
And you can see it's imported from lodash.debounce.

323
00:15:48.962 --> 00:15:50.417
And before you start crying,

324
00:15:50.417 --> 00:15:52.917
"Oh, Wes don't import lodash into the project

325
00:15:52.917 --> 00:15:54.210
"just for one little function,"

326
00:15:54.210 --> 00:15:59.210
Lodash will automatically ship each of their functions

327
00:15:59.210 --> 00:16:01.910
as separate packages, which is what this is.

328
00:16:01.910 --> 00:16:04.770
And that will only include the very small code

329
00:16:04.770 --> 00:16:06.270
that is used to debounce a function

330
00:16:06.270 --> 00:16:08.550
and not the entire Lodash library.

331
00:16:08.550 --> 00:16:11.350
Then to debounce, you pass it a couple of things.

332
00:16:11.350 --> 00:16:14.307
First, the function, which is findItems.

333
00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:17.670
And the second argument

334
00:16:17.670 --> 00:16:20.450
is how many milliseconds do you want it to debounce for?

335
00:16:20.450 --> 00:16:24.030
And then that will, at most, every 350 milliseconds

336
00:16:24.030 --> 00:16:26.530
will we run this fetch network request.

337
00:16:26.530 --> 00:16:28.060
So that is really good.

338
00:16:28.060 --> 00:16:30.733
Then we'll go into our onInputValueChange

339
00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:35.938
and run findItemsButChill.

340
00:16:35.938 --> 00:16:39.320
So you can fire off that thing

341
00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:41.690
as much as you could possibly want,

342
00:16:41.690 --> 00:16:43.530
but lodash will make sure

343
00:16:43.530 --> 00:16:45.160
that it's not actually going to be run

344
00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:48.130
more than once every 350 milliseconds.

345
00:16:48.130 --> 00:16:51.560
Last thing we need to do is to pass the value

346
00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:54.210
of the input box to the variables.

347
00:16:54.210 --> 00:16:57.740
Now, because the value of the input box

348
00:16:57.740 --> 00:17:01.170
can be either be accessed through the state

349
00:17:01.170 --> 00:17:02.950
that comes back from useCombobox.

350
00:17:02.950 --> 00:17:04.600
And let's actually destructure that right now.

351
00:17:04.600 --> 00:17:06.738
It's called inputValue.

352
00:17:06.738 --> 00:17:08.190
But you can also get that

353
00:17:08.190 --> 00:17:10.240
from the callback function right here.

354
00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:12.170
It should pass you the inputValue.

355
00:17:12.170 --> 00:17:13.570
Yeah, you see it's right here.

356
00:17:13.570 --> 00:17:15.580
I'm not gonna destructure it

357
00:17:15.580 --> 00:17:19.650
just because that value comes from useCombobox.

358
00:17:19.650 --> 00:17:22.610
But when we call findItemsButChill,

359
00:17:22.610 --> 00:17:24.903
we need to pass it our variables.

360
00:17:26.730 --> 00:17:28.567
And the searchTerm

361
00:17:31.803 --> 00:17:33.103
is going to be inputValue.

362
00:17:36.390 --> 00:17:39.990
Okay, so I know this is starting to get a little bit hairy

363
00:17:39.990 --> 00:17:41.653
because look at this one,

364
00:17:42.870 --> 00:17:45.580
this is one function right here (laughs).

365
00:17:45.580 --> 00:17:48.400
So these are the things that we destructure from it.

366
00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:50.353
This is the of the method.

367
00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:55.740
And these are the options that we pass to the useCombobox.

368
00:17:55.740 --> 00:17:58.440
So it does get a little bit hairy once we get into it

369
00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:00.450
but it's certainly much better

370
00:18:00.450 --> 00:18:03.250
than having to do it ourselves.

371
00:18:03.250 --> 00:18:06.110
So if that is happening now,

372
00:18:06.110 --> 00:18:11.110
we should be getting some data back from this useLazyQuery

373
00:18:11.410 --> 00:18:13.210
whenever that thing fires off.

374
00:18:13.210 --> 00:18:16.743
So if I console.log data,

375
00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:19.460
I should get undefined.

376
00:18:19.460 --> 00:18:23.722
But now as I type things, like yeti, there we go.

377
00:18:23.722 --> 00:18:26.480
We get undefined a couple of times,

378
00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:29.810
but once we do get the data back,

379
00:18:29.810 --> 00:18:31.174
and this is...

380
00:18:31.174 --> 00:18:32.300
Don't be alarmed,

381
00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:35.480
this is not three network requests happening.

382
00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:38.960
This is just that that component has rerendered three times

383
00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:41.520
because of things changing inside of it.

384
00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:43.820
But if you look, open it up, searchTerm,

385
00:18:43.820 --> 00:18:48.030
look at there is the three items that we actually want.

386
00:18:48.030 --> 00:18:50.170
So we can take that data

387
00:18:51.770 --> 00:18:55.030
and go into our DropDown here

388
00:18:55.030 --> 00:19:00.030
and start to render out the items as DropDownItems.

389
00:19:02.410 --> 00:19:03.860
So go here.

390
00:19:03.860 --> 00:19:06.750
Let's actually make a variable called items.

391
00:19:06.750 --> 00:19:11.750
So const items = data?.searchTerms

392
00:19:19.750 --> 00:19:21.250
or just an empty array.

393
00:19:21.250 --> 00:19:24.020
We'll fall back to an empty array.

394
00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:26.513
Then we'll go down to this right here.

395
00:19:27.879 --> 00:19:29.980
You can remove those Hey dropdowns.

396
00:19:29.980 --> 00:19:34.563
And we'll say items.map item.

397
00:19:35.490 --> 00:19:39.870
And for each item, we will return the

398
00:19:41.570 --> 00:19:43.083
DropDownItem, DropDownItem.

399
00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:48.030
And inside of that DropDownItem,

400
00:19:48.030 --> 00:19:52.090
we can put the item.name just as a very basic.

401
00:19:52.090 --> 00:19:52.930
There we go.

402
00:19:52.930 --> 00:19:55.360
So now if I search for shoes,

403
00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:59.120
you see how it takes a second before the items come back,

404
00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:01.193
even though I was like typing yeti?

405
00:20:02.810 --> 00:20:04.490
See how it waits for me to stop typing?

406
00:20:04.490 --> 00:20:06.100
And then after 300 milliseconds,

407
00:20:06.100 --> 00:20:08.930
it will go ahead and display them.

408
00:20:08.930 --> 00:20:10.513
So shoes.

409
00:20:11.756 --> 00:20:16.370
You see this very faint glowing around the input box

410
00:20:16.370 --> 00:20:17.430
that we have here?

411
00:20:17.430 --> 00:20:20.260
That is because of this class of loading.

412
00:20:20.260 --> 00:20:23.160
We can now say, if it is loading,

413
00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:24.420
then give it a class of loading,

414
00:20:24.420 --> 00:20:27.270
otherwise, give it a class of nothing.

415
00:20:27.270 --> 00:20:29.846
And that will only turn on,

416
00:20:29.846 --> 00:20:32.233
let's see if we can do it really close and see,

417
00:20:33.085 --> 00:20:35.350
when I'm searching for something, see?

418
00:20:35.350 --> 00:20:38.190
For a split second, you see that it does go back

419
00:20:38.190 --> 00:20:42.450
to the the network and turns on the loading state.

420
00:20:42.450 --> 00:20:47.450
So you could put a spinner or you could also turn on

421
00:20:48.050 --> 00:20:49.700
the end progress on the top.

422
00:20:49.700 --> 00:20:52.400
Lots of neat things you can do with that.

423
00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:53.980
But let's focus our attention

424
00:20:53.980 --> 00:20:56.370
back on these DropDownItems inside of here.

425
00:20:56.370 --> 00:20:59.640
We need to display the image of the actual item

426
00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:01.300
inside of that DropDownItem.

427
00:21:01.300 --> 00:21:03.450
So we'll go right above the name here

428
00:21:03.450 --> 00:21:05.830
and give ourselves an img tag.

429
00:21:05.830 --> 00:21:10.830
The source will be the item.photo.image.public,

430
00:21:13.170 --> 00:21:15.033
oops, .publicUrlTransformed.

431
00:21:19.430 --> 00:21:23.830
And then the alt will be the item.name.

432
00:21:23.830 --> 00:21:26.713
Pop a width of 50 px on there.

433
00:21:29.879 --> 00:21:32.120
There we go, now we're starting to see images

434
00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:34.020
of the actual items show up.

435
00:21:34.020 --> 00:21:36.740
And now we wanna work with our arrow keys.

436
00:21:36.740 --> 00:21:39.210
'Cause as you're typing something like yeti

437
00:21:39.210 --> 00:21:40.650
and you use your arrow keys,

438
00:21:40.650 --> 00:21:43.580
we wanna be able to highlight those items

439
00:21:43.580 --> 00:21:45.450
showing the user that that's the item

440
00:21:45.450 --> 00:21:47.070
that they have currently selected.

441
00:21:47.070 --> 00:21:48.760
Same thing goes when you wanna hover

442
00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:50.350
and click the item as well.

443
00:21:50.350 --> 00:21:54.733
So they provide a additional method

444
00:21:56.180 --> 00:21:58.023
in the useCombobox.

445
00:22:00.340 --> 00:22:02.780
It's called getItemProps.

446
00:22:02.780 --> 00:22:04.393
So we'll destructure it up here.

447
00:22:07.810 --> 00:22:11.430
And we have to go down to the DropDownItem right here.

448
00:22:11.430 --> 00:22:13.283
Curly brackets, ...getItemProps,

449
00:22:14.510 --> 00:22:17.860
and you pass it your actual item.

450
00:22:17.860 --> 00:22:20.940
So it'll be like this.

451
00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:22.380
But I don't think I need to tell you

452
00:22:22.380 --> 00:22:23.490
what that means anymore.

453
00:22:23.490 --> 00:22:27.010
I've mentioned that enough in this course.

454
00:22:27.010 --> 00:22:31.210
Additionally, the DropDownItem needs a key

455
00:22:31.210 --> 00:22:33.890
because we are mapping over each of the items.

456
00:22:33.890 --> 00:22:36.140
No different than any other time we map over something.

457
00:22:36.140 --> 00:22:38.720
So we'll just give it the item.id.

458
00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:40.200
Let's make sure that just works here.

459
00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:42.890
So I'll search for yeti and...

460
00:22:42.890 --> 00:22:44.360
Oh, bit of an error.

461
00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:47.440
Pass either an item or item index to getItemProps.

462
00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:49.420
So we did pass the item,

463
00:22:49.420 --> 00:22:52.560
but I think you also need to let Downshift

464
00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:55.300
know about all the possible items that there is.

465
00:22:55.300 --> 00:22:57.550
So we've got to go back up here.

466
00:22:57.550 --> 00:23:00.770
Remember we just put an empty array here.

467
00:23:00.770 --> 00:23:03.680
You have to give it an array of our actual items

468
00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:04.720
which is this right here.

469
00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:08.170
So we'll say items and that should save to the short form.

470
00:23:08.170 --> 00:23:09.003
There we go.

471
00:23:09.003 --> 00:23:10.373
Does that fix it for us?

472
00:23:11.942 --> 00:23:12.780
There we go.

473
00:23:12.780 --> 00:23:14.700
And it might not look like much,

474
00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:17.480
but if you take a look at the actual...

475
00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:21.080
Look at all the markup that Downshift is giving us

476
00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:22.280
for this type of thing.

477
00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:24.750
And I believe if you...

478
00:23:24.750 --> 00:23:29.750
There we go, look at, as I am using my arrow keys,

479
00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:32.241
you can see that the aria-selected values

480
00:23:32.241 --> 00:23:36.070
are changing from true to false, which is really cool.

481
00:23:36.070 --> 00:23:38.490
So we can visually make those show up also

482
00:23:38.490 --> 00:23:41.820
by passing a highlighted prop to the DropDownItem

483
00:23:41.820 --> 00:23:43.890
so our style component will pick it up.

484
00:23:43.890 --> 00:23:47.830
So I'll just say highlighted is equal to,

485
00:23:47.830 --> 00:23:50.160
and we'll check if the index of the item

486
00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:53.040
is equal to the currently selected index.

487
00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:57.220
So if I press down right here and press down again,

488
00:23:57.220 --> 00:23:58.730
you see how the middle one is true?

489
00:23:58.730 --> 00:24:01.350
The index of the highlighted will be 1.

490
00:24:01.350 --> 00:24:03.350
So we'll say we need the index

491
00:24:03.350 --> 00:24:05.060
of the actual item we're looping over.

492
00:24:05.060 --> 00:24:06.460
So go to this item here.

493
00:24:06.460 --> 00:24:09.073
And also destructure the index.

494
00:24:10.618 --> 00:24:14.770
Then we'll say if the index is equal to highlightedIndex.

495
00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:22.850
And that highlightedIndex is not a variable just yet.

496
00:24:22.850 --> 00:24:26.880
We need to destructure that again from useCombobox, right?

497
00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:29.000
All the values come from useCombobox

498
00:24:30.170 --> 00:24:32.130
and they will provide them to you.

499
00:24:32.130 --> 00:24:35.223
And as you need them, we can destructure them from that.

500
00:24:36.890 --> 00:24:39.880
So watch now, search for shoes.

501
00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:40.780
It's not working.

502
00:24:40.780 --> 00:24:43.203
I spelled highlightedIndex wrong.

503
00:24:51.103 --> 00:24:52.740
There we go, you see?

504
00:24:52.740 --> 00:24:54.170
Good, good, good.

505
00:24:54.170 --> 00:24:56.120
So we are almost there.

506
00:24:56.120 --> 00:24:58.220
There's just a couple more bits.

507
00:24:58.220 --> 00:25:00.470
First we need to take care of what happens

508
00:25:00.470 --> 00:25:04.130
when you hit the escape key or if you click outside.

509
00:25:04.130 --> 00:25:09.130
And what that is is a value called isOpen

510
00:25:10.280 --> 00:25:12.870
that, again, useCombobox gives to us.

511
00:25:12.870 --> 00:25:13.990
And that will keep track

512
00:25:13.990 --> 00:25:16.430
of whether this thing is currently open or not.

513
00:25:16.430 --> 00:25:20.610
It'll, as you hit escape or you focus out of the input,

514
00:25:20.610 --> 00:25:23.470
then it will turn that Boolean to true or false.

515
00:25:23.470 --> 00:25:27.370
And we can just simply go to before our items.map

516
00:25:27.370 --> 00:25:29.660
and check if it is open.

517
00:25:29.660 --> 00:25:32.355
And if this is false, then it will not go forward

518
00:25:32.355 --> 00:25:34.500
and map over the items for us.

519
00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:37.160
So watch, so let's search for shoes.

520
00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:39.530
And if I click outside, it goes away.

521
00:25:39.530 --> 00:25:42.260
Click back into it, search for shoes.

522
00:25:42.260 --> 00:25:44.820
If I hit my escape key, and that goes away as well.

523
00:25:44.820 --> 00:25:47.973
So that's the first item that we have there.

524
00:25:49.320 --> 00:25:52.070
Next little thing we need to take care of

525
00:25:52.070 --> 00:25:56.210
is if there's nothing that is returned from that.

526
00:25:56.210 --> 00:25:59.750
So we'll go right below the looping,

527
00:25:59.750 --> 00:26:02.530
right before the closing DropDown here

528
00:26:02.530 --> 00:26:06.897
and we'll say, if it is open

529
00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:10.880
and there are no items

530
00:26:12.470 --> 00:26:15.790
and we're not loading.

531
00:26:15.790 --> 00:26:19.010
So basically, if it's not open, there's no items

532
00:26:19.010 --> 00:26:20.070
and there's no loading,

533
00:26:20.070 --> 00:26:22.440
that means we are not in a state

534
00:26:22.440 --> 00:26:23.780
where we're currently searching for 'em

535
00:26:23.780 --> 00:26:26.380
and we have nothing to show for it.

536
00:26:26.380 --> 00:26:29.140
So if all of those things are true,

537
00:26:29.140 --> 00:26:34.140
we will simply put a DropDownItem that says,

538
00:26:34.810 --> 00:26:39.810
Sorry, No items found for,

539
00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:41.910
and we can interpolate

540
00:26:41.910 --> 00:26:44.253
what they were searching for, inputValue.

541
00:26:46.910 --> 00:26:48.780
Now if we search for something really silly

542
00:26:48.780 --> 00:26:51.480
like grilled cheese, it says,

543
00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:54.500
Sorry, No items found for grilled cheese.

544
00:26:54.500 --> 00:26:56.480
And we can still click outside of it

545
00:26:56.480 --> 00:26:59.300
and it will tell us that those items are not found.

546
00:26:59.300 --> 00:27:02.020
Last thing we need to do is this onSelectedItemChange.

547
00:27:02.020 --> 00:27:04.610
When somebody actually selects one of these shoes here,

548
00:27:04.610 --> 00:27:08.724
so I go down to one and I hit enter or I click it,

549
00:27:08.724 --> 00:27:12.770
right now it just this object Object in the text bar

550
00:27:12.770 --> 00:27:14.420
and it doesn't change the page.

551
00:27:14.420 --> 00:27:15.824
So what we wanna do here is,

552
00:27:15.824 --> 00:27:19.670
it will actually give us access to the selected item.

553
00:27:19.670 --> 00:27:22.330
So destructure that with some curly brackets here.

554
00:27:22.330 --> 00:27:25.167
And we'll just console.log selectedItem.

555
00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:32.330
And If I search for yeti,

556
00:27:32.330 --> 00:27:34.170
go down, I hit enter on one of those,

557
00:27:34.170 --> 00:27:37.720
in our console it says, Selected Item.

558
00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:40.330
There is the selected item that the user want.

559
00:27:40.330 --> 00:27:43.460
And the important part that we want is this id.

560
00:27:43.460 --> 00:27:47.340
So we can go into here and say, we need the router, right?

561
00:27:47.340 --> 00:27:51.800
We need to be able to change the page with the router.

562
00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:54.800
So we can go to the very top of our component.

563
00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:57.530
const router = useRouter.

564
00:27:58.879 --> 00:28:00.829
We'll have to import that from next.js.

565
00:28:06.470 --> 00:28:09.143
And we'll go here, we'll say router.push.

566
00:28:10.260 --> 00:28:13.685
And the path name is equal to,

567
00:28:13.685 --> 00:28:14.720
we have to use back ticks to interpolate it,

568
00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:19.720
/product/selectedItem.id.

569
00:28:21.460 --> 00:28:23.890
Now we can get rid of those console logs.

570
00:28:23.890 --> 00:28:27.580
So now if I search for yeti, go down, boom,

571
00:28:27.580 --> 00:28:29.870
you see it changes the actual page.

572
00:28:29.870 --> 00:28:32.330
You'll see it does this object Object.

573
00:28:32.330 --> 00:28:34.220
And if you ever see this in JavaScript,

574
00:28:34.220 --> 00:28:38.080
what that means is that they try to take an object

575
00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:40.560
and run the .toString method on it.

576
00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:41.850
If you ever have an object

577
00:28:41.850 --> 00:28:44.060
and it looks a little something like this,

578
00:28:44.060 --> 00:28:49.060
like curly brackets and you .toString on it, you get...

579
00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:51.700
Oh, maybe I need some parentheses around that.

580
00:28:51.700 --> 00:28:52.810
You get object Object.

581
00:28:52.810 --> 00:28:53.660
That's what happens

582
00:28:53.660 --> 00:28:56.460
when you try to make an object into a string.

583
00:28:56.460 --> 00:29:00.980
So we have to pass an additional little option

584
00:29:00.980 --> 00:29:04.573
to our useCombobox, which is right here.

585
00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:10.247
And we'll do it right at the bottom that says itemToString.

586
00:29:11.340 --> 00:29:14.920
And that is just a little function that takes the item.

587
00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:19.330
And actually we can do this as an arrow function.

588
00:29:19.330 --> 00:29:21.100
This is a perfect use case for an arrow function.

589
00:29:21.100 --> 00:29:24.600
So we have the item and we will say

590
00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:29.600
if the item is equal to null, sometimes it is null,

591
00:29:29.980 --> 00:29:31.900
then we'll return nothing.

592
00:29:31.900 --> 00:29:35.463
Otherwise, we return the item.name.

593
00:29:36.500 --> 00:29:38.400
Or actually we could just do

594
00:29:40.700 --> 00:29:43.030
item.name or

595
00:29:46.090 --> 00:29:48.710
empty and then put a question mark on there.

596
00:29:48.710 --> 00:29:49.543
And that will say,

597
00:29:49.543 --> 00:29:51.410
if there is an item, give me the item name.

598
00:29:51.410 --> 00:29:53.040
Otherwise, it will be undefined

599
00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:57.060
and it'll fall back to this single quotes.

600
00:29:57.060 --> 00:29:58.660
So now if I search for something

601
00:30:00.120 --> 00:30:02.390
and then it actually puts the text in there.

602
00:30:02.390 --> 00:30:05.980
So if we were to literally return anything,

603
00:30:05.980 --> 00:30:10.155
WES IS COOL from there,

604
00:30:10.155 --> 00:30:14.460
that's the text that gets shown in here, see?

605
00:30:14.460 --> 00:30:16.140
WES IS COOL, right?

606
00:30:16.140 --> 00:30:21.140
So we want to programmatically grab the actual item name

607
00:30:21.320 --> 00:30:23.050
which is awesome.

608
00:30:23.050 --> 00:30:24.640
So that is our search component.

609
00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:25.870
Quite a nice little package

610
00:30:25.870 --> 00:30:27.450
for working with this type of stuff.

611
00:30:27.450 --> 00:30:29.200
And I'll catch you in the next one.
