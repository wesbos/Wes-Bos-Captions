00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.070 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now, when you click on your avatar,
you go to this URL, /account,

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:19.630 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and of course it 404s. So let's
handle that now. Open up our routes,

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:26.753 line:100% position:50% align:middle
index.js. Go to the bottom here and
we'll say, router.get('/account',).

00:00:26.753 --> 00:00:31.600 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And when somebody does that, we will take
our userController and we'll just say,

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:36.820 line:100% position:50% align:middle
.account. Good. Now, let's open up our
userController, and we'll create a method

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:42.170 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to handle that. So I'll say,
exports.account = (req, res). This is

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:51.280 line:100% position:50% align:middle
simply going to be res.render, the
('account'), and the title will be 'Edit

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:57.710 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Your Account'. Good. Now, we should see
that it cannot find the account views

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:04.680 line:100% position:50% align:middle
file. Good. I'll open up our views
folder and create a view for that.

00:01:11.418 --> 00:01:15.580 line:100% position:50% align:middle
There we go. It works. Now, what do
we need? First, we need an .inner.

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:20.150 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Then, we need a form with the action of
"/account". So we're going to post to

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.240 line:100% position:50% align:middle
ourselves, and then we can start
making our Edit Account interface.

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:31.790 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So I'll say, h2 Edit Your Account. We have
our form, which has a method of "POST",

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:36.684 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and we have a label for the
"name", input name of "name",

00:01:36.684 --> 00:01:40.798 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and then the value is
going to be user.name.

00:01:40.798 --> 00:01:44.571 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Ah, okay. Interesting. Because
user is going to be passed to every

00:01:44.571 --> 00:01:52.450 line:100% position:50% align:middle
single request. We open up our
app.js and we'll say, locals.user.

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:56.860 line:100% position:50% align:middle
What this is doing is it's taking the
req.user, which Passport will make

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:02.120 line:100% position:50% align:middle
available to us, and we're passing the
user to our locals, which are all the

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:05.370 line:100% position:50% align:middle
variables that our template is going to
have, and we're going to pass it along.

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:08.740 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now, before, that was just null,
because we were not logged in.

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:13.100 line:100% position:50% align:middle
However, in this case, now that we have
req.user, which Passport gives us,

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.950 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we can pass it along to our locals.
So we can give it user.name.

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.810 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Let's just see if that works so far.
There we go. Name is Wes.

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:28.150 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Good. I like it. Then, we'll have
label(for="email"), input(type="email"),

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:33.773 line:100% position:50% align:middle
name="email", and value=user.email.
Then, finally, I'll have a Save.

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.560 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Name, email, Save button. We don't have
password here. That's going to come

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.070 line:100% position:50% align:middle
next. We just have Name and Email.
Those are the only two pieces of

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:45.370 line:100% position:50% align:middle
information we have on our account right
now. Good. Now, if I were to change this

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:52.520 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to Wesley and update my account, it's
404-ing. The reason why is because when

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:55.870 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you visit your account, that's get.
But when you post the data,

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.150 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that's router.post, and we don't have
a route to handle that just yet.

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:05.490 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we can go ahead, back to our index.js
here, and we'll go to our '/account' here.

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:08.670 line:100% position:50% align:middle
First, actually, we need to make sure that
they're logged in before they can go to an

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:16.470 line:100% position:50% align:middle
account URL. So we'll just say,
authController.isLoggedIn, and then

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:19.170 line:100% position:50% align:middle
user.account. And that'll just make
sure that they're logged in before,

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:25.820 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and then the redirect will kick in for us.
Now, we'll have router.post('/account',

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:29.979 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and we'll run
userController.updateAccount.

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:37.020 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now, that's going to be using async/await,
so we can wrap it in catchErrors. Good.

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:41.030 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So now, we need to make an updateAccount
method on our userController.

00:03:41.619 --> 00:03:49.260 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Go down here, exports.updateAccount.
We'll do async (req, res).

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:58.476 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now, what we need to do is take all the
data that the user has sent us and update

00:03:58.476 --> 00:04:02.110 line:100% position:50% align:middle
their account with it. But in this case,
we don't want to update the hash or

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:05.590 line:100% position:50% align:middle
anything like that. So we're going to make
a separate variable of just called

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:13.212 line:100% position:50% align:middle
updates. const updates =. And the name
might be updated, so req.body.name and

00:04:13.212 --> 00:04:17.970 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the email might be updated, so
email: req.body.email. Good.

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:21.950 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now, what we're going to do is we're
going to take our user model and call

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:27.585 line:100% position:50% align:middle
findOneAndUpdate. And what that will do is
it's going to query for a specific user,

00:04:27.585 --> 00:04:31.510 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and then we're going to update
that actual user. So we'll say,

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:39.580 line:100% position:50% align:middle
const user = await User, that's our model,
.findOneAndUpdate, and this will take

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:43.260 line:100% position:50% align:middle
three things. We've used one similar
to this before. First, the query.

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:48.860 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Second, the updates. And then, third, some
options, which it's going to allow us to

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:51.240 line:100% position:50% align:middle
run the validators on it. Right?
So I'll start with the first one,

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:54.334 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the query. I'm going to put these each on
their own line, because they can get a

00:04:54.334 --> 00:04:59.880 line:100% position:50% align:middle
little bit long. The query is going to
be based on the ID of the user.

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:06.250 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we can simply say the
_id is req.user. _id

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:09.147 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and that's really important,
that you actually pull the ID

00:05:09.147 --> 00:05:12.430 line:100% position:50% align:middle
from the request, rather than
having the user give you their

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:15.960 line:100% position:50% align:middle
ID. Because that could easily be monkeyed
with, and you don't want them actually

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:22.430 line:100% position:50% align:middle
faking the ID. So req.user. _id, that's
the query. Second, the update is going to

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:28.800 line:100% position:50% align:middle
be something called $set: updates, and
what that will do is it's going to take

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:33.857 line:100% position:50% align:middle
this and set it on top of what already
exists in the user, because these are the

00:05:33.857 --> 00:05:37.361 line:100% position:50% align:middle
only two pieces of information we're
updating. Although, our user could have a

00:05:37.361 --> 00:05:41.880 line:100% position:50% align:middle
lot more data associated with it.
Then, third was the options,

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:46.649 line:100% position:50% align:middle
which is going to be new: true,. That
means it returns the new actual user.

00:05:46.649 --> 00:05:51.820 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Second, runValidators is going to
be true, and that will make sure that if

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:55.761 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the user is running any sort of monkey
business, that it's just going to run them

00:05:55.761 --> 00:06:00.920 line:100% position:50% align:middle
through all the actual validation steps.
And then context is going to be 'query'.

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:04.400 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Context is required for Mongoose to
actually do the query properly.

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:08.479 line:100% position:50% align:middle
If you want to look into that, it's a bit
boring. But it needs to be there.

00:06:08.479 --> 00:06:14.580 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now, once we have that, let's just say,
res.json(user). I would like to just see

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:20.110 line:100% position:50% align:middle
what the actual user is on. So go to our
user profile now, and I'll try to update

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:24.740 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it to Wesley, Update My Account, and
ha-ha. There we go. We're automatically

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:28.790 line:100% position:50% align:middle
sending back the user, and you can
see that the name is now Wesley.

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:32.551 line:100% position:50% align:middle
But we don't need to send them to json.
What we really need to do is just say,

00:06:32.551 --> 00:06:36.299 line:100% position:50% align:middle
res.redirect and in this case we
could either do two things.

00:06:36.299 --> 00:06:39.930 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We could just say 'back' or we
could redirect them to '/account'.

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:44.670 line:100% position:50% align:middle
It doesn't matter and if you say 'back',
it will just redirect you to the URL that

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:50.310 line:100% position:50% align:middle
they came from. When that's helpful is
if this was ever working on multiple

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:53.380 line:100% position:50% align:middle
endpoints, 'back' would just send them
right back to the other one that they

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:59.170 line:100% position:50% align:middle
have. So let's refresh this, go to
Account, change this to Westerhoff,

00:07:00.083 --> 00:07:04.800 line:100% position:50% align:middle
go to save, and you can see
automatically Westerhoff is saved.

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:07.025 line:100% position:50% align:middle
What we could do is
give ourselves a success,

00:07:07.025 --> 00:07:12.002 line:100% position:50% align:middle
req.flash('success',
'Updated the profile!').

00:07:12.002 --> 00:07:17.320 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So Wassssley, Update. Then,
we get our flash, Updated

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:21.200 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the profile and we see the updated
pieces of information showing.

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:25.700 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Good. One more thing I just wanted to show
you is that you always have this req.user

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:29.460 line:100% position:50% align:middle
available to you. So what you could do is,
you could go to any one of these pages,

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:36.630 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and you could do a quick dump,
pre= h.dump(req.user). Or no,

00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:41.207 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it's just user, because in this case
it's locals.user. And if you refresh,

00:07:41.207 --> 00:07:44.790 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you're going to see a dump of the actual
user and it's going to have the ID,

00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:48.542 line:100% position:50% align:middle
unique identifier, your name, and your
email. Of course, we're going to get into

00:07:48.542 --> 00:07:53.090 line:100% position:50% align:middle
a lot more with hearting our actual
stores. So that is editing our account.

00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:57.686 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Let's move on to the next piece, which
is creating a password reset flow,

00:07:57.686 --> 00:07:59.700 line:100% position:50% align:middle
if we've forgotten our password.

00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:03.100 line:100% position:50% align:middle
