00:00:11.823 --> 00:00:14.047 line:100% position:50% align:middle
In this video, we're going to
write some client-side JavaScript

00:00:14.047 --> 00:00:18.295 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to make our lives a little bit easier
for storing latitude and longitude.

00:00:18.295 --> 00:00:21.050 line:100% position:50% align:middle
You see that I have this address
field. This is the finished version that

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:26.720 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I've got up and running. If I were to say
"Paris," and it will automatically give me

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:31.060 line:100% position:50% align:middle
this drop down autocomplete, where I can
select Paris and hit enter.

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:33.820 line:100% position:50% align:middle
It's going to populate the lat and the
long, or the long and the lat.

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:38.390 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And I can do things like Hamilton,
Ontario. And it will give me the long and

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:42.920 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the lat. So that's extremely helpful
because there's no way that I want to type

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.075 line:100% position:50% align:middle
in the lat and long and your users also
don't know that. So, this is called

00:00:47.075 --> 00:00:52.410 line:100% position:50% align:middle
geolocation where it's going to...you give
it an address or the name of a...

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.020 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Mulberry Coffee. That's a coffee shop
around the corner from me.

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:58.957 line:100% position:50% align:middle
You just give it something that you'd
normally type into Google, and then it

00:00:58.957 --> 00:01:04.240 line:100% position:50% align:middle
will do sort of a reverse lookup for the
lat and the long, and store it in there.

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:07.850 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So that's what we want to do. And let's
take a look at how client-side JavaScript

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:14.510 line:100% position:50% align:middle
is written in our course. If you open up
your public folder, and you open up your

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:20.560 line:100% position:50% align:middle
JavaScript folder you're going to see this
delicious_app.js. This is sort of the

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.520 line:100% position:50% align:middle
entry point for all of our JavaScript.
This is where Webpack is bundling them all

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.710 line:100% position:50% align:middle
together. And then in our modules
directory is where we're going to write

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:34.760 line:100% position:50% align:middle
each of the client-side modules that will
happen. So I've already included bling.js.

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:40.176 line:100% position:50% align:middle
If you've never used it before, bling.js
will just give us short form to document

00:01:40.176 --> 00:01:44.133 line:100% position:50% align:middle
our query selector and query selector
all. It will give us .on on

00:01:44.133 --> 00:01:49.220 line:100% position:50% align:middle
each of our nodes. So we could say... it
sort of makes it look like jquery and a

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:55.840 line:100% position:50% align:middle
little bit nicer. So we can do things like
.wrapper on click. And rather than us

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:01.580 line:100% position:50% align:middle
having to do the whole var wrapper equals
document.queryselector and then wrapper.

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:04.720 line:100% position:50% align:middle
addevent listen or click etc. You get
the point. Right? So,

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:09.200 line:100% position:50% align:middle
this is just a little helper called bling
js. I modified it a little bit but it's

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:14.430 line:100% position:50% align:middle
based on Paul Irish's thing. He was a
pretty cool developer from Google and you

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:19.620 line:100% position:50% align:middle
should check out what he's done here. So
we want to make a module and we're going

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:25.230 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to call it autocomplete. So we'll go into
our modules folder and call autocomplete.

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:29.970 line:100% position:50% align:middle
js. And we're going to make a function
called autocomplete. That's going to take

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:39.400 line:100% position:50% align:middle
in an input, a lat input and a long
input. And from that it's going to do the

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:44.590 line:100% position:50% align:middle
work for us and populate. Then we can
export default autocomplete.

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:49.910 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So I'm using ES6 here because we do not
have ES6 on node just yet.

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:54.510 line:100% position:50% align:middle
But we do have ES6 in Webpack and the
ability to compile that for us.

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:59.100 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we have that. And we'll go back into
our delicious app right here and we will

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:09.640 line:100% position:50% align:middle
import that. Import autocomplete from
modules autocomplete. Good so then we have

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:14.120 line:100% position:50% align:middle
this autocomplete function that we can
just run. Click autocomplete and we need

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:18.740 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to pass it three things. We need to pass
it our address... address input,

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:22.760 line:100% position:50% align:middle
our longitude input, and our latitude
input. But you'll notice here that I've

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.780 line:100% position:50% align:middle
done it lat and long. So opposite.
Why? Because Google Maps does it the right

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:30.560 line:100% position:50% align:middle
way and MongoDB does it the other way. So
it's kind of confusing got to keep

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:35.040 line:100% position:50% align:middle
switching them around. But stay sharp,
you'll get it. So first thing we need we

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:42.650 line:100% position:50% align:middle
need to pass it the address input
#address. So let's go to our store form

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:48.810 line:100% position:50% align:middle
.pug and our address has an ID of address,
Our long has ID of long, and

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:53.710 line:100% position:50% align:middle
our lat has an ID of lat. Good. So
address... the second thing we need to

00:03:53.710 --> 00:04:01.122 line:100% position:50% align:middle
pass it is the latitude. Is that right?
Yeah. Lat input. And the third thing we

00:04:01.122 --> 00:04:04.512 line:100% position:50% align:middle
need to pass it is the longitude.

00:04:06.503 --> 00:04:09.816 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Again this is not jquery.
Looks like jquery but rather

00:04:09.816 --> 00:04:15.990 line:100% position:50% align:middle
than us doing $ it's just saying document.
queryselector. But who's got time to write

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:20.300 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that? We just do $ nice and quickly. Good.
So we have that. Let's go back and into

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:25.200 line:100% position:50% align:middle
our autocomplete and let's just
console.log the input, the lat input,

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:29.010 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and the long input. Just make sure
that's all working. So we'll go back to

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:35.010 line:100% position:50% align:middle
our activation here. Refresh the page.
And there we go. We got our input.

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:40.060 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Our input are required here. Good so these
are all working. Now we're going to write

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:46.610 line:100% position:50% align:middle
some JavaScript for Google. First thing
will say, 'If there is no input, return."

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:54.200 line:100% position:50% align:middle
What that will do is, "skip this function
from running if there is no input on the

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:58.680 line:100% position:50% align:middle
page." It's a bunch of different ways you
could do that it's a nice simple one to

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:03.730 line:100% position:50% align:middle
skip that function from running if there's
no address on the actual page.

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:06.048 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Then, first we need the drop down.

00:05:06.048 --> 00:05:09.769 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And this is part of the
Google Maps autocomplete API.

00:05:09.769 --> 00:05:14.530 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So I've already loaded up if you view
source on this sucker right here.

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:20.760 line:100% position:50% align:middle
You will see, like, Google... You'll see
that we've already loaded in Google Maps

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:31.687 line:100% position:50% align:middle
with the API key right there. So we'll say
"const dropdown = new google.maps

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:38.460 line:100% position:50% align:middle
.places.Autocomplete," capital A.
And then you give it an input value.

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:44.530 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Good so just that alone, if we refresh
this. We go to... Let's go to add a new

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:49.564 line:100% position:50% align:middle
one, actually. Now if I were to type in
here "Paris," it will automatically start

00:05:49.564 --> 00:05:54.820 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to autocomplete it. So just with that one
line of code, we now have autocomplete

00:05:54.820 --> 00:06:00.530 line:100% position:50% align:middle
showing up on that. But, that doesn't give
us all that much because we need to

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:07.590 line:100% position:50% align:middle
populate the lat and long. So we'll take
this drop down and we'll add listener.

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:10.840 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And add listener is a Google Maps
way to add an event listener.

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:16.380 line:100% position:50% align:middle
You listen for the event called
"place_change." And when that happens

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:21.170 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we're going to run a little arrow function
here. And we'll say, "const place =

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:26.959 line:100% position:50% align:middle
dropdown." So that's the actual Input
".getPlace." Let's just console log

00:06:26.959 --> 00:06:33.070 line:100% position:50% align:middle
palace...place. Let's console log the
place here and see what we've got.

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:36.780 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So open up your dev tools here.
And bring that sucker on the bottom.

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:42.140 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Give it a refresh. And let's type in
Paris. Hit enter. And you see when I hit

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:47.970 line:100% position:50% align:middle
enter, it will automatically give us this
object here with address components,

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:54.110 line:100% position:50% align:middle
all of the different pieces of the actual
address. It gives us some photos of Paris.

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:58.080 line:100% position:50% align:middle
It gives us some HTML attribute.
It gives us the geometry.

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:02.551 line:100% position:50% align:middle
It gives us the types. That's the locale
... Locality and political...

00:07:03.004 --> 00:07:07.144 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Everything you could possibly ever want,
it will format the address as well in the

00:07:07.144 --> 00:07:14.029 line:100% position:50% align:middle
HTML. So what we do need is if we open up
the geometry, and we open up...

00:07:14.029 --> 00:07:15.927 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Where did that go?
There we go.

00:07:15.927 --> 00:07:19.920 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Geometry.location.lat.
And that's a function that will give us

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:25.617 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the actual lat as well as the long. So
here's what we do. We say, 'latInput.

00:07:25.617 --> 00:07:35.475 line:100% position:50% align:middle
value = place.geometry.location.lat"
and you can just duplicate that and

00:07:35.475 --> 00:07:42.123 line:100% position:50% align:middle
change out the lng with the lng. And then
if we then refresh this page and you'll

00:07:42.123 --> 00:07:49.194 line:100% position:50% align:middle
notice every time we take a save, your
Webpack bundle, if I clear this out,

00:07:49.194 --> 00:07:52.549 line:100% position:50% align:middle
give us a save. Notice that Webpack...
Didn't change anything.

00:07:52.549 --> 00:07:55.733 line:100% position:50% align:middle
If you change something and give it a
save, you'll notice that Webpack will

00:07:55.733 --> 00:07:57.559 line:100% position:50% align:middle
re-bundle it for us.

00:07:57.559 --> 00:08:00.714 line:100% position:50% align:middle
You actually have to make a
significant change in order for it to

00:08:00.714 --> 00:08:04.150 line:100% position:50% align:middle
trigger a change. It won't trigger a
change on something like a semicolon.

00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:09.588 line:100% position:50% align:middle
There we go. Put it back in. Give it a
save. It will regenerate our app.bundle.js

00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:14.140 line:100% position:50% align:middle
file for us, which is great. We
refresh this. Now If I type in Paris,

00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:18.140 line:100% position:50% align:middle
select one of them, it's going to
automatically populate the long and the

00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:23.080 line:100% position:50% align:middle
lat. Again, let me do Hamilton, Ontario.
It will automatically populate the lat and

00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:30.070 line:100% position:50% align:middle
long. What? What happened there? So
Hamilton. Okay. And then I type in Paris

00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:34.264 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and hit enter. And it actually refreshes
the page. Why?

00:08:34.264 --> 00:08:36.924 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Because what's happening
here is we're typing

00:08:36.924 --> 00:08:41.880 line:100% position:50% align:middle
in Paris and hitting enter.
By hitting enter, we're doing two things.

00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:46.980 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We're confirming the autocomplete. But
then we're also submitting the entire

00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:54.100 line:100% position:50% align:middle
form. Because by hitting enter in one of
these inputs here it will cause the form

00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:59.060 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to actually submit. So we can quickly fix
that. Go right below this drop down here.

00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:10.170 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And we'll say, "If someone hits enter on
the address field, don't submit the form."

00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:15.144 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we'll take our input, which is the
address field. We'll say .on

00:09:15.144 --> 00:09:19.271 line:100% position:50% align:middle
because we have on because normally it's
.add event listener.

00:09:19.271 --> 00:09:27.980 line:100% position:50% align:middle
But we can do input.on because we are
using bling.js. So on key down.

00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:36.120 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And then there's an event and we'll say,
If e.key code is equal to 13...

00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:41.860 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Why? Because keycode.info... This is if
you hit enter, 13 is the keycode for

00:09:41.860 --> 00:09:47.750 line:100% position:50% align:middle
enter. Escape 27. You get the point. So
"if e.keycode = 13," we're going to say

00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:54.750 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"e.prevent default," and that will
stop the regular, which is submitting the

00:09:54.750 --> 00:09:58.929 line:100% position:50% align:middle
actual form. So give that a save. Let's
double check that now. Go back to our

00:09:58.929 --> 00:10:06.229 line:100% position:50% align:middle
store here. Type in Paris. Hit enter. Type
in Hamilton. Hit enter. You'll see that

00:10:06.229 --> 00:10:10.721 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it's not submitting the form now, it's
just confirming the autocomplete that we

00:10:10.721 --> 00:10:11.334 line:100% position:50% align:middle
have there.

00:10:11.334 --> 00:10:15.845 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Good. So that is the autocomplete
for Google. We are going to come back to
