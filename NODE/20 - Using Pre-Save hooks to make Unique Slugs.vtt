00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.990 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Let's take a hot second to fix an issue
that we have with our slugs,

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.210 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and that is if you have something of the
same name, the slug will get overwritten.

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.850 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So let's say we have Brew Bar here, and
the slug is brew-bar. If I were to add

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:30.430 line:100% position:50% align:middle
another one called "Brew Bar," because
there's two Brew Bars, and we'll call it

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:35.010 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"Brew Bar 2"... Upload a photo real quick.
Brew Bar, let's see.

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:44.350 line:100% position:50% align:middle
There's one in Australia. Good. We upload
it. We successfully created it,

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:49.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
but "Good Beers" was the description of
the first one. Now, how do we get to the

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.110 line:100% position:50% align:middle
second one? Well, we've created this
unreachable URL, where we have Brew Bar

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:58.020 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and Brew Bar. Both of them go to,
actually, the first Brew Bar,

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.790 line:100% position:50% align:middle
not the second Brew Bar. That's just
because, if we open up our schema,

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:09.390 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Store.js, and our Models directory, you'll
see that our .pre('save') function here is

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.540 line:100% position:50% align:middle
pretty simple, in that it just says,
"this.slug = slug(this.name)".

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:17.350 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we're not checking for any duplicate
slugs, or anything like that,

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:20.760 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and that's exactly what we want to do
right now. So we will change this function

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:26.180 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to an async function. Because what we're
going to do is, before we save the actual

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:31.390 line:100% position:50% align:middle
store, we're going to check if there are
any other stores with that same slug.

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.370 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we'll go down here. We'll make it
async, go down below where we say,

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:42.020 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"this.slug = slug", and then we need to
find other stores that have a slug of wes,

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:48.260 line:100% position:50% align:middle
wes-1, wes-2, etc. Because the whole idea
here is, if we have a store called "Wes",

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.630 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and then we have a second store called
"Wes", it should be Wes 1.

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.840 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Then, if we have already two stores that
are Wes and Wes 1, it should be Wes 2,

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:02.660 line:100% position:50% align:middle
etc.etc. So what we need to do here is
make a RegEx that is going to search for

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:07.920 line:100% position:50% align:middle
stores that have a slug of wes, wes-1,
wes-2, wes-3. So essentially,

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:14.130 line:100% position:50% align:middle
what we need to do is, we need to search
for stores that have anything with "Wes"

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:19.550 line:100% position:50% align:middle
or anything that has "wes-", and then some
sort of number. So it's going to be a

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:23.380 line:100% position:50% align:middle
little bit of a complex RegEx that we have
here. Feel free to go ahead and grab this

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.950 line:100% position:50% align:middle
from the step solutions if you don't feel
like typing this by hand.

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.180 line:100% position:50% align:middle
But I really just want to get the point
across about how this actually works.

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:35.120 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we're first going to make a RegEx,
which is "const slugRegEx".

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.560 line:100% position:50% align:middle
If you've never written a RegEx before,
it's sort of like a way to pattern match

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:46.140 line:100% position:50% align:middle
in JavaScript. We'll say, "new RegExp()",
regular expression. The regular expression

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:51.940 line:100% position:50% align:middle
is going to be in backticks. Let's do the
second part first. We'll just say it's

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.920 line:100% position:50% align:middle
'i', which is case insensitive. So if we
have an uppercase or a lowercase,

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.230 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I don't want to have the slugs overriding
each other in that sense.

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:04.390 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So our regular expression is going to have
a hat and parentheses.

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:09.230 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Then, we put "this.slug" inside of it. So
far, what this means is that we are

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:15.560 line:100% position:50% align:middle
searching for URLs that start with
"this.slug". Okay. So far so good.

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:21.920 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Then, we want to have a second group here,
where we say it ends with...

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:28.590 line:100% position:50% align:middle
That's what $ is. It ends with one of two
things. We put another capture in there,

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:35.820 line:100% position:50% align:middle
a dash and zero through nine, and then
that can be as many. It could be one.

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:41.860 line:100% position:50% align:middle
It could be wes-100. So we have * and $,
which means that ends with that.

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:45.450 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Then, in between those two, we're going to
put a question mark,

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:50.950 line:100% position:50% align:middle
which means that part is option. Woo. What
that means is we're looking for something

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:54.070 line:100% position:50% align:middle
with a slug, and then it might end
in -1, -2, -3, -4, -5. Next,

00:03:54.070 --> 00:04:01.340 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we need to actually pass that RegEx into a
query. So we'll say,

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:07.980 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"const storesWithSlug = await". Now, we
need to... We essentially want to say

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:15.390 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"store.find", but we don't have "store"
yet, because we actually haven't even made

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:20.360 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it yet. So how do you access the model
inside of a model's function?

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:25.570 line:100% position:50% align:middle
This was a little bit confusing to me at
first. But I eventually got it with

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:31.120 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"this.constructor.find", and
"this.constructor" will be equal to

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:37.500 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"store" by the time it actually runs.
We're going to find stores where the slug

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:44.070 line:100% position:50% align:middle
is equal to the slugRegEx. So when you
have to do sort of a fuzzy match,

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:49.140 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you can always use a RegEx, instead of an
actual absolute value.

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:53.880 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Then, right here, we're going to say,
"if(storesWithSlug.length)",

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:58.950 line:100% position:50% align:middle
so if there are any matches that have come
back, we're simply going to overwrite

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:09.230 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"this.slug" by saying, "this.slug = ''".
We're going to say "${this.slug}-" and

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:13.520 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we're going to say, "-1, -2, -3, -4". We
need to make that part dynamic.

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:23.120 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we'll say, "${storesWithSlug.length +
1}". So what will happen is if we search

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:26.950 line:100% position:50% align:middle
for "Wes", it's going to come back with,
"Yes. Somebody already used that," and

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:30.770 line:100% position:50% align:middle
there's going to be one. So we're going to
say, "Okay. Well, that slug is already

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:35.090 line:100% position:50% align:middle
taken. This is going to be wes-1." So it's
going to be wes-1, and then there'll be

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:38.720 line:100% position:50% align:middle
wes-2, wes-3, etc. , etc. So give that a
save. Then we call "next",

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:43.340 line:100% position:50% align:middle
which will continue on the saving of our
actual data to the database.

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:48.220 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We'll give this a refresh. We'll try to
make a new Brew Bar now.

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:56.080 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So click on Add, Brew Bar. We'll say,
"Brew Bar 3". Choose a file here and

00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:04.010 line:100% position:50% align:middle
upload. "Bar". Let's get another one. Man,
Australia has a lot of Brew Bars.

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:08.720 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Save, and you can see now
that Brew Bar is showing up.

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:13.610 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Because there was two already, Brew Bar 3
is now... If I ever were to add a fourth,

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:17.840 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it would be Brew Bar 4, etc.etc. You get
the point. Right? So sometimes you need to

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:23.980 line:100% position:50% align:middle
make a little bit more advanced functions,
and that is done in your store schema pre

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:27.700 line:100% position:50% align:middle
hooks. Because we're using async/await, we
don't need to use any callbacks.

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:30.512 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We just make that
function async, as well.
