00:00:12.122 --> 00:00:16.180 line:100% position:50% align:middle
In this video, we're going to finally
work on our actual single store layouts.

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:18.298 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So, when you hit one of...
I'm on the answer right here,

00:00:18.298 --> 00:00:20.118 line:100% position:50% align:middle
but when you go to your list of stores

00:00:20.118 --> 00:00:22.800 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and you were to click on one of
the stores, there's a couple of things

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:29.260 line:100% position:50% align:middle
going on here. First, we need to find
the actual store that has this slug,

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:33.370 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and the next, what we need to do
is pull in the name of the store,

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:36.810 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the photo of the store, we need to create
a map of the store, we need to show the

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:40.470 line:100% position:50% align:middle
address, a description, a list of tags.
And then eventually what we're going to do

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:44.570 line:100% position:50% align:middle
is, we're going to be getting into either
showing a login form if the user is logged

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:48.110 line:100% position:50% align:middle
in, or if they're logged out, it
tells them to log in to review.

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:52.850 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And then it will show a list of all the
possible reviews. So, a lot going on here,

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.700 line:100% position:50% align:middle
let's jump into it. If you're sort of
feeling comfortable, with this whole make

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:01.650 line:100% position:50% align:middle
a route, make a controller, then the
controller will query the database,

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:05.130 line:100% position:50% align:middle
get some data, and then pass it to a
template to render, maybe I would suggest

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:09.900 line:100% position:50% align:middle
like pausing the video right here and try
to do this piece on your own.

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.420 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So, let's click on one of these, and of
course we're going to get a 404 because we

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.150 line:100% position:50% align:middle
do not have a route set up for that. So,
it says butcher-and-the-vegan.

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:26.300 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now, what we're going to do is go into our
routes file, index .js, and first set up

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:34.953 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the route for that. So, I'm going to go
down here, say, router.get('/store/ and

00:01:34.953 --> 00:01:38.167 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we're going to call that a slug.
And when that happens,

00:01:38.167 --> 00:01:39.826 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we are going to run and we'll just say

00:01:39.826 --> 00:01:47.050 line:100% position:50% align:middle
catchErrors(storeController.
getStoreBySlug)). Good.

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:51.030 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Then we'll go into our storeController,
and we'll go to the bottom here,

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:57.551 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and we'll make a new one, say
exports.getStorebySlug. We're going to

00:01:57.551 --> 00:02:00.660 line:100% position:50% align:middle
make it async because we're going
to be creating the database.

00:02:01.492 --> 00:02:05.460 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Request and we have our
response, and we're up and running.

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.425 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So, again, let's always just test that it
actually works. res.send('it works!'),

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:15.478 line:100% position:50% align:middle
refresh, good. So, we are hitting
this URL and we say that it

00:02:15.478 --> 00:02:19.792 line:100% position:50% align:middle
actually works. So, first thing that we
need to do is query the database for that

00:02:19.792 --> 00:02:27.362 line:100% position:50% align:middle
specific store. So let's say const store =
and then we will await Store.findOne

00:02:27.362 --> 00:02:29.713 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and now here, what is our
query going to look like?

00:02:29.713 --> 00:02:31.780 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Well, we only have one piece of data and

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.280 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that is the actual slug, right?
We don't have the ID of the store,

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.820 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we only have a slug. So, we need to do a
lookup at our database for a store where

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:44.830 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the slug field is set to this.
So, we'll say the slug is set to,

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:49.750 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and now how do I access the actual
parameters? Well, again, if I were to

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:56.014 line:100% position:50% align:middle
comment this out, we could
res.json(req.params).

00:02:56.014 --> 00:02:58.240 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And then req.params is going to just be

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:02.640 line:100% position:50% align:middle
an object full of all the data that
is in the URL that we've set out

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.500 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to. So, it's a slug, why? Because
we put a slug in our URL here,

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:11.440 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and that will give it to us. So, we can
go back to here. Slug is equal to

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:19.390 line:100% position:50% align:middle
req.params.slug. Then when we have
that actual store, what we're going to do

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:24.680 line:100% position:50% align:middle
is give ourselves, and we're going to say
res.json(store). Let's just double check

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:30.770 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that we have that data coming back. Good.
So, we have all of the data that we know

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:34.620 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that our query is actually working.
However, what happens if we hit a URL that

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:42.960 line:100% position:50% align:middle
doesn't exist? Veganx. Then we get null.
So, it actually still does work when you

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:49.080 line:100% position:50% align:middle
give it the wrong URL. But ideally what
would happen, is that we would show a 404

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:54.130 line:100% position:50% align:middle
because that's not actually a page
that exists. So, in our case,

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:59.090 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we need to handle this ourselves because
if a store, if a query in MongoDB does not

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:03.590 line:100% position:50% align:middle
find anything, that's not necessarily an
error, it's just a query that returns

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:07.560 line:100% position:50% align:middle
null. So, we need to sort of check
ourselves, so we'll say if there is,

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:14.450 line:100% position:50% align:middle
no store, then what we need to do is
return next. Or often you'll see just

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:18.880 line:100% position:50% align:middle
someone call next and then type
return. So, those are both valid.

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:21.900 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Often, you'll see people do it on one line
even without the if statements.

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:26.090 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So, return next, like that. Those are all
three the same. So, what does that do?

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:29.670 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Well, you tell me what next does. Well,
first of all, we actually have to pass

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:36.230 line:100% position:50% align:middle
next here, but what does it actually do?
Well, next will assume that this is a

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:41.755 line:100% position:50% align:middle
middleware and pass it along to the next
steps. So, again, I know you're probably

00:04:41.755 --> 00:04:45.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
getting sick of me showing you this,
but I really want to drill this home.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.900 line:100% position:50% align:middle
If we go to our app.js, and we find our
routes, there we go, this is our routes

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:55.224 line:100% position:50% align:middle
right here. And if it is not found, it's
just going to say, "All right well, next."

00:04:55.224 --> 00:04:58.410 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Move on to the next piece of
middleware, which is this notFound

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:02.655 line:100% position:50% align:middle
handler. And that's going to kick in. So,
that's all we need to do in order to

00:05:02.655 --> 00:05:07.990 line:100% position:50% align:middle
render out a 404, give it a save. Now if I
refresh this page, we should see a 404

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:13.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
page because that store is not found,
but if I take the X off the URL,

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.600 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we should actually get...or actually right
now we're not sending any sort of data but

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:23.450 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we could say res.json(store),
and actually get the data for that

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:27.960 line:100% position:50% align:middle
specific store. Good, so again, put an X
on the end, 404, go back to our real

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:31.710 line:100% position:50% align:middle
store, and we see the actual data. Good.
That's what we want, and at this point

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:35.650 line:100% position:50% align:middle
now, we don't want to just json
it back, we want to res.render it,

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:39.040 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and we want to render out a store
template, which we'll make in a second.

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:43.040 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And what is the data we need to pass?
Well, we need to pass the store: store,

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:47.040 line:100% position:50% align:middle
which again, we can just do that with
store, and then we want to pass the title,

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:51.880 line:100% position:50% align:middle
which is going to be the store.name
value that gets passed in. Good.

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:56.950 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now, we'll open up our views, and make a
new file and we'll call that store.pug,

00:05:56.950 --> 00:06:01.286 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and we will extends the layout.
We have a block of content

00:06:01.286 --> 00:06:03.371 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and inside of that let's
just do, right away,

00:06:03.371 --> 00:06:08.970 line:100% position:50% align:middle
let's just do an h2 tag that will
contain the store.name, just to

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:12.230 line:100% position:50% align:middle
make sure that this is working.
So, refresh one of your pages,

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:16.170 line:100% position:50% align:middle
there we go, Butcher and the Vegan, and
go back to stores, Click on Brew Bar.

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:21.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So, now we know that our controller is
querying the database, getting a store

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.610 line:100% position:50% align:middle
back and passing it along to store.pug.
So, now it's just a templating problem,

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:30.440 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and if you want to try to match it to what
this looks like, feel free to go ahead.

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:32.455 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Otherwise, let's work on this now.

00:06:32.455 --> 00:06:34.519 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So, we would need a
[inaudible] class of single,

00:06:34.519 --> 00:06:39.763 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and inside of that, we need a
single__hero, inside of that we need an

00:06:39.763 --> 00:06:47.710 line:100% position:50% align:middle
image with a class of single__image, with
a source of, need to use backticks here,

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:57.250 line:100% position:50% align:middle
/uploads/ store.photo or we want to use
again, store.png. Let's see if this is

00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:03.030 line:100% position:50% align:middle
working now. Click on Brew Bar, beautiful,
see some burgs, click on the Coffe Shop,

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:05.940 line:100% position:50% align:middle
which doesn't have one and it will
give us the default image. Good,

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:09.940 line:100% position:50% align:middle
really happy with that. Then we need to go
underneath it, and give ourselves an h2,

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:16.790 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the class of title, and title--single,
inside of that we want an a(href=

00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:21.360 line:100% position:50% align:middle
again we need to use backticks
whenever we do generated strings,

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:27.590 line:100% position:50% align:middle
stores/ and we want to put a store.slug.
I know we link to ourselves but it's

00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:33.380 line:100% position:50% align:middle
generally good to do for SEO, and then
we'll put our store.name inside of it.

00:07:33.773 --> 00:07:39.650 line:100% position:50% align:middle
How we doing? Good, showing up.
Brew Bar, all of our CSS is kicking in.

00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:46.420 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now, inside of or at the same level as
single, we want to put in some details.

00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:53.047 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So, not inside of single, as a sibling to
single, and so we have a single__details

00:07:53.047 --> 00:07:56.930 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and we also want to give it a class of
inner, which will just constrain the width

00:07:56.930 --> 00:08:02.766 line:100% position:50% align:middle
of it. We have an image with a class of
single__map, let's give that a save and

00:08:02.766 --> 00:08:08.880 line:100% position:50% align:middle
refresh. What needs to happen here is that
we need to get what's called a static map

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:13.510 line:100% position:50% align:middle
with Google Maps. And how static maps
work, if I go here you'll notice that if I

00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:17.690 line:100% position:50% align:middle
click this, it's not actually like an
embedded Google map, there's no JavaScript

00:08:17.690 --> 00:08:21.460 line:100% position:50% align:middle
here, it's actually just an image tag. And
I can go ahead and inspect that,

00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:31.613 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and you can see the source of this map is
googleapi/map/staticmap/center, 43 -79,

00:08:31.613 --> 00:08:35.060 line:100% position:50% align:middle
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah and it has
an API key and a marker in there.

00:08:35.060 --> 00:08:39.910 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So, if I go visit this URL here, you'll
see that this is just a static map that

00:08:39.910 --> 00:08:43.980 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I've created with a center, as well as you
can put a number of markers and set the

00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:49.450 line:100% position:50% align:middle
zoom on it in there. Now, there's a whole
lot that goes into making one of these

00:08:49.450 --> 00:08:54.270 line:100% position:50% align:middle
static maps, if we look at all the
params here. What do we have?

00:08:54.270 --> 00:09:00.160 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We've got center, we've got zoom, we've
got size, we've got our API key,

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:06.140 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we've got markers, which is the lat and
lng, and we have a scale, which allows us

00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:13.780 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to do high DPI for retina-based devices.
So, rather than have to do all of that

00:09:13.780 --> 00:09:17.970 line:100% position:50% align:middle
generation right inside of our template,
we're going to use our template helpers,

00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:23.250 line:100% position:50% align:middle
just like we learned about in our earlier
video. So, if you open up helpers.js,

00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:29.010 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you'll see that we have a function here
called staticMap that takes in an array,

00:09:29.010 --> 00:09:32.440 line:100% position:50% align:middle
where the first thing is the lng
and the second thing is the lat.

00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:39.440 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Why? Because MongoDB will give it to us in
lng lat and then from that we use an

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:43.210 line:100% position:50% align:middle
arrow function which will have an implicit
return. And again, if you are a little bit

00:09:43.210 --> 00:09:48.830 line:100% position:50% align:middle
confused by what all this is, definitely
check out my ES6 For Everyone at es6.io

00:09:48.830 --> 00:09:54.170 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that will clear all of this syntax up for
you. So, https:, google.maps blah,

00:09:54.170 --> 00:09:59.760 line:100% position:50% align:middle
blah, blah, blah, blah, center= lat lng.
Why? Because MongoDB is lng, lat,

00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:05.160 line:100% position:50% align:middle
but Google Maps is lat lng. Then you
want a zoom, hardcoded 14,

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:10.890 line:100% position:50% align:middle
size, hardcoded key=process.env. MAP_KEY.
So where is that coming from?

00:10:10.890 --> 00:10:15.120 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Well, go to your variables.env.
MAP_key, that's going in there.

00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:19.040 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So, if you want to sign up for your own
Google Maps key, you pop that in there and

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:23.420 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it will automatically be replaced.
I never like to put any sort of API key

00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:27.060 line:100% position:50% align:middle
hardcoded into template files because
it's inevitably going to change and you're

00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:32.820 line:100% position:50% align:middle
going to have a couple of issues when you
work with that. Then we have a markers,

00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:35.800 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and the markers is going to be
exactly at the lat and lng as well,

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:40.050 line:100% position:50% align:middle
so it's going to be exactly at center,
wherever it is. And scale is set to 2.

00:10:40.050 --> 00:10:43.760 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So, we have this little helper file here
where you pass in the lng and the lat,

00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:47.300 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and then it will return to us this very
long string, which will give us this

00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:52.120 line:100% position:50% align:middle
hardcoded value. So we can say
src= and we simply just said

00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:57.960 line:100% position:50% align:middle
h, helpers, .staticMap, and you pass
it the array of coordinates, which is

00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:03.020 line:100% position:50% align:middle
available to us at
store.location.coordinates. And again, if

00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:06.116 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you're having trouble like visualizing
what is the data available to us,

00:11:06.116 --> 00:11:10.177 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you can always do a
pre=h.dump(store), just to

00:11:10.177 --> 00:11:16.560 line:100% position:50% align:middle
see what available data is to you.
So, now if I give this page a refresh,

00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:22.630 line:100% position:50% align:middle
now we see the actual map, the pin, I got
my dump showing up, I can remove that,

00:11:22.630 --> 00:11:26.300 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and everything is working out for me.
Good. Let's keep going. We got a paragraph

00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:31.070 line:100% position:50% align:middle
of class of single__location.
Inside of that we need to put our

00:11:31.070 --> 00:11:37.790 line:100% position:50% align:middle
store.location.address, there we go.
Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, working well.

00:11:37.790 --> 00:11:43.240 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Then we need to show some tags inside of
that. So we'll say if there is store.tags

00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:49.020 line:100% position:50% align:middle
so if there are tags, because otherwise
we don't want an empty tags list.

00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:53.960 line:100% position:50% align:middle
On our list the class of tags, and
then we want to loop over each of the

00:11:53.960 --> 00:12:00.340 line:100% position:50% align:middle
store tags in there so we use each tag in
store.tags. So, store.tags is going to be

00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:02.780 line:100% position:50% align:middle
our array. Tag is going to be each

00:12:02.780 --> 00:12:06.952 line:100% position:50% align:middle
singular one, whatever it's called on each
iteration. We have a list item with a

00:12:06.952 --> 00:12:12.674 line:100% position:50% align:middle
class of tag, inside of that we have a
link with a class of tag__link,

00:12:12.674 --> 00:12:17.170 line:100% position:50% align:middle
which is the href is going to set to again
backticks because we're generating the URL

00:12:17.170 --> 00:12:24.960 line:100% position:50% align:middle
here. Tags/ and then we'll use our
tag value there. And then, finally,

00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:31.800 line:100% position:50% align:middle
inside of that, we have a span with a
class of tag__text and that will be just

00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:37.070 line:100% position:50% align:middle
a tag value or it can be something
like that. So, let's refresh that.

00:12:37.070 --> 00:12:41.154 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Beautiful. Family friendly, licensed. What
you could do with this is, if you wanted

00:12:41.154 --> 00:12:44.564 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to add something around
it like parentheses,

00:12:44.564 --> 00:12:46.756 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the parentheses would show up.
Or if you wanted to make it

00:12:46.756 --> 00:12:50.080 line:100% position:50% align:middle
look like a hashtag, you could
put another # in front of it,

00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:54.960 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and it would say #Family Friendly
#Licensed. So, that's the beauty of using

00:12:54.960 --> 00:13:00.170 line:100% position:50% align:middle
this layout here. So, that's the base
layout for everything that we've got here.

00:13:00.170 --> 00:13:05.070 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Actually one thing we forgot was the
description, and that will go right

00:13:05.070 --> 00:13:09.370 line:100% position:50% align:middle
underneath the location. So just say
p=store.description and that gets

00:13:09.370 --> 00:13:11.860 line:100% position:50% align:middle
popped in. Obviously, those descriptions
are going to be a little bit longer.

00:13:11.860 --> 00:13:16.380 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So, that's it for now on this single page.
We're going to come back once we have our

00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:22.834 line:100% position:50% align:middle
login and register working and actually
hook up some reviews, the ability to

00:13:22.834 --> 00:13:24.869 line:100% position:50% align:middle
review as well as displaying past reviews.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
