Now that I have some
reviews being piped in,

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:17.480 line:100% position:50% align:middle
how do we get them to show up when we
visit a single store?

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.260 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Going to click over to Randy's Joint here.
I'm going to leave a quick review.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:26.090 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"Love this place." Give it a five star
review, submit the review,

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:30.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and it brings us right back to the
specific review page. So no problem there.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.460 line:100% position:50% align:middle
But how do I actually pull in a list of
reviews in here? Well,

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:39.240 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"reviews" is its own data type and
"stores" are its own data type,

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:42.660 line:100% position:50% align:middle
so how do we sort of like, have a
relationship between the two?

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:48.580 line:100% position:50% align:middle
If we look at our review.js, we are saving
the store here, but if we look at our

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:55.980 line:100% position:50% align:middle
store, we don't have anything to do with
the reviews that are on the storeSchema.

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.890 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So, this would be a bit of a pain, because
if we wanted to in the review save the

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:06.040 line:100% position:50% align:middle
store, but then under the store save a
list of actual reviews,

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.980 line:100% position:50% align:middle
then all the sudden we're managing data in
two places. We're managing the store and

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:13.400 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the review, and the review and the store.
And those can get out of sync really

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.130 line:100% position:50% align:middle
quickly, not to mention how much of a pain
it is to keep those up to date.

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.340 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So really what we want to do is, when we
visit a store page, we also want to do a

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:27.910 line:100% position:50% align:middle
second query, which is going to search for
any reviews where the store is equal to

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:32.260 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the actual ID of the specific store. But,
we can even go one better,

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:36.800 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and this is a new thing in Mongoose, and
it's called "virtual populate." So let's

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.840 line:100% position:50% align:middle
close our review.js, because we actually
aren't going to need it.

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.580 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And right below the getTagsList, right
before we actually make our model here,

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:46.810 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we're going to add a new field to our
schema called "Reviews."

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:52.010 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So say "storeSchema.virtual," and the
field is called "reviews." And the options

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:55.390 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that we pass it is...before it was a
function where we immediately return

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.830 line:100% position:50% align:middle
something. But in this case we're going to
tell it to go off to another model,

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:03.440 line:100% position:50% align:middle
in this case our review model, and
actually do a quick query for us.

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:07.570 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So say, the reference is going to be a
review. Why? Because if we look at our

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:13.210 line:100% position:50% align:middle
review.js, the name of our model is
capital R, "Review." So that's why it is

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:18.410 line:100% position:50% align:middle
referenced to that model here. Then we say
our local field and our foreign field are

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.650 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"ID" and "store." So let's type this and
I'll explain it, because this was a bit

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.110 line:100% position:50% align:middle
trippy for me at first.

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:29.500 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So our local field is "_id," and our
foreign field is going to be equal to

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:34.820 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"store." Now what does this mean? Well,
our local field is, which field on our

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:41.490 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Store needs to match up with which field
on our foreign model?

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:47.390 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Which, this just should say "Review
field." Right? Like, "Which field on the

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:57.030 line:100% position:50% align:middle
review?" And, "Which field on the store?"
And, "What model to link?" Right?

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:05.110 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So what this essentially says is, "Find
reviews where the store's ID is equal to

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:13.220 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the review's store property." It would
say, "ID property." Right?

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:19.340 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So if we open up our MongoDB Compass here,
and I look at our stores,

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:27.620 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we're saying, "Find a review where the
store's ID, 58C0, is equal to a review's

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:32.390 line:100% position:50% align:middle
store property, 58F..." Those aren't the
same, but if they were the same,

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:35.950 line:100% position:50% align:middle
then it would automatically populate
that in the Reviews field,

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:40.980 line:100% position:50% align:middle
because they then line up. So this is sort
of like a join, if you've ever used SQL

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:46.050 line:100% position:50% align:middle
before. But it's nice virtual field, so
that we're actually not saving any sort of

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:50.010 line:100% position:50% align:middle
relationship between the two. It's just
100% virtual.

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:56.570 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So now if we actually go back to our store
controller, and we look at the method that

00:03:56.570 --> 00:04:01.930 line:100% position:50% align:middle
was used to do this page. Remember that
was "getStore BySlug." There we go.

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:06.040 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And we're already populating the author
field. Now we can populate our new field,

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:11.260 line:100% position:50% align:middle
which is "Reviews." Give that a save. Now
here's a little funny thing that will trip

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:16.080 line:100% position:50% align:middle
a lot of people up. If we go to our
store.pug and try to do a dump - store.pug

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:20.490 line:100% position:50% align:middle
- and we have some comments on Randy's,
right? If you're not sure if your actual

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:25.310 line:100% position:50% align:middle
store has some comments, make sure you
say, "Love you." Make sure you add a

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:27.490 line:100% position:50% align:middle
comment to that actual store.

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:34.730 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Oh, it broke. What did I do? I broke it!
Oh my goodness! Virtual is not a function.

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:40.400 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I know how to spell. I bet I don't. Back
up and running. Leave her a comment,

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:44.140 line:100% position:50% align:middle
give it a review. There we go, we've added
an element. So now we got a couple of

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:48.730 line:100% position:50% align:middle
reviews for Randy's Joint. We were to go
to store.pug and we do...take a quick

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:55.160 line:100% position:50% align:middle
dump. "pre=h.dump," the store. And you'll
see that we do have the author being

00:04:55.160 --> 00:05:00.560 line:100% position:50% align:middle
populated, but where is our reviews?
Didn't we populate it?

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:05.600 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And here, watch this. "store.reviews." So
now if I explicitly call the reviews

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:10.150 line:100% position:50% align:middle
property, something we don't see on it
right here, there they are.

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:16.220 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Huh. So that's something about, by
default, virtual fields do not actually go

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:22.180 line:100% position:50% align:middle
into either an object, or into JSON unless
you explicitly ask it to,

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:26.990 line:100% position:50% align:middle
right? So what we want to do here is open
up your store.js and there are some

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:30.870 line:100% position:50% align:middle
options on your schema which will allow
you to actually bring those to JSON

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:34.490 line:100% position:50% align:middle
[inaudible]. It's not an issue
for us, because the data is there.

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:40.470 line:100% position:50% align:middle
But whenever you convert your actual model
data into an object or into JSON,

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:44.160 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it will by default not put virtuals in
that object or in that JSON.

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:49.200 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So if you do want to change that, you can
go to your schema here,

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:53.910 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and we can go down here and pass an
object, and we say, any time it is passed

00:05:53.910 --> 00:06:03.940 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to JSON, you can say the virtuals is true.
And you can do the same to Object,

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:07.400 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and say, "Virtual is true." And what that
will do is, any time that a actual

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:11.600 line:100% position:50% align:middle
document is converted to either JSON or to
an object - in this case it's being

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:15.700 line:100% position:50% align:middle
converted to an object, so we can dump it
on the page - then it will actually bring

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:19.200 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the virtuals along for the ride. Even
though they are there, they're sort of

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:23.740 line:100% position:50% align:middle
invisible to JSON and to Objects. So give
it a refresh, and there you go.

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:28.550 line:100% position:50% align:middle
See, all the sudden, the reviews field has
been populated. It's not necessary to do

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:34.110 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that unless you actually are worried about
it not showing up in your ".dump," to view

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:38.370 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it on the page. And I like to often see it
on the page before I loop over each one.

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:43.420 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So good. Now we're getting all of the
reviews. We can actually go back into our

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:47.750 line:100% position:50% align:middle
store.pug and start to loop over each of
them. So we'll go down here,

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:53.370 line:100% position:50% align:middle
below the "if user," and we'll say, "If
store.reviews..." So if there are reviews,

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:56.700 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we're going to give ourself a
reviews div. And we'll say,

00:06:56.700 --> 00:07:04.950 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"Each review in store.reviews." We're
going to have a review div.

00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:12.300 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And then we...let's just try output, like
a paragraph tag with the review.text.

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:15.220 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Just to see if we can get it up and
running, then we'll make a little partial

00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:19.270 line:100% position:50% align:middle
for that to handle it. Refresh that.
Scroll down. "This place rocks.

00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:21.300 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Love this place. Love this place so much."

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:25.770 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Good. So let's make a new mixin that we
can make a review in it.

00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:32.590 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we'll go into our views mixins, and
we'll make a "_review.pug" mix-in.

00:07:32.590 --> 00:07:37.610 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Hit "review," and it takes in a review.
And at first we're going to have a review

00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:44.560 line:100% position:50% align:middle
header and we're going to have a review
author. Below that we'll have a review

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:49.650 line:100% position:50% align:middle
stars, we'll have a time tag with a class
of review time. And then below the header

00:07:49.650 --> 00:07:54.460 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we'll have a review body, which is a
paragraph tag with "Review.text."

00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:57.750 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we're going to come back and fill these
all in, but I'd like to just get the text

00:07:57.750 --> 00:08:01.780 line:100% position:50% align:middle
showing up for now. So give that a save.
Back to your store.pug,

00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:09.010 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we need to import our mixin, and then go
ahead and use it. So,

00:08:09.010 --> 00:08:14.170 line:100% position:50% align:middle
how do we use a mix-in? Plus review, pass
it the actual review itself.

00:08:14.170 --> 00:08:17.490 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So the mixin's called "Review." Each of
them is called "Review" here.

00:08:17.490 --> 00:08:22.140 line:100% position:50% align:middle
If that confuses you, that they're named
the same thing, just call it "R." "Each R

00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:25.520 line:100% position:50% align:middle
in store.reviews." And then each review is
called "R." Doesn't confuse me,

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:27.890 line:100% position:50% align:middle
though. I'm going to keep it.

00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:31.290 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now, there we go. "Love this place. This
place rocks. Love this place so much."

00:08:31.290 --> 00:08:36.020 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We've got our three coming up, no problem
there. So let's go back into the reviews

00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:38.290 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and start to work our way through.

00:08:38.290 --> 00:08:44.460 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So the first one is the review author, but
if we look here, each review,

00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:48.860 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the author is just a number, right? Like,
I guess we could say,

00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:54.520 line:100% position:50% align:middle
like, "Paragraph equals review.author,"
and then, just display the author's actual

00:08:54.520 --> 00:09:00.110 line:100% position:50% align:middle
ID. That's who commented, 58F. Right? But
that's not really what we want.

00:09:00.110 --> 00:09:04.170 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We want to populate that data with an
avatar and some data about the user.

00:09:04.170 --> 00:09:10.400 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So what we're going to need to do is to go
one step further, and make sure that when

00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:16.400 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the review is actually queried, it's going
to auto-populate our actual author field

00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:20.150 line:100% position:50% align:middle
for us, because we need the information
about that author.

00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:25.920 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we'll go back into our review.js, our
model, and we're going to make a function

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:32.920 line:100% position:50% align:middle
called "Auto Populate." Function
"autopopulate." Takes a "next".

00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:38.540 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And we're going to say
"this.populate('author') call next." And

00:09:38.540 --> 00:09:44.640 line:100% position:50% align:middle
what this will do is we can add hooks to
whenever this review is queried,

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:47.950 line:100% position:50% align:middle
what we're going to do is automatically
populate the author field,

00:09:47.950 --> 00:09:52.460 line:100% position:50% align:middle
so we don't have to explicitly go in and
ask for the author field to be populated

00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:57.810 line:100% position:50% align:middle
every single time. So we'll take our
review schema and we're going to say

00:09:57.810 --> 00:10:00.750 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"pre('find')." We're going to run
autopopulate. And "pre('findOne')" we're

00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:01.830 line:100% position:50% align:middle
also going to populate.

00:10:01.830 --> 00:10:06.280 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So what this will do is it will add hooks.
For any time somebody finds or finds one,

00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:09.890 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and it's going to populate the author
field of each of those. Now if I give that

00:10:09.890 --> 00:10:13.910 line:100% position:50% align:middle
a save and refresh this, you see that the
author field...oh, wow!

00:10:13.910 --> 00:10:28.570 line:100% position:50% align:middle
The author field just got updated to
"wesbos@gmail.com." So each of the reviews

00:10:28.570 --> 00:10:33.250 line:100% position:50% align:middle
now has a subsequent author field which
has been populated with all the possible

00:10:33.250 --> 00:10:37.990 line:100% position:50% align:middle
data that we need. So we're now dumping
the entire value onto the field.

00:10:37.990 --> 00:10:42.160 line:100% position:50% align:middle
That's not what we need. So we'll go back
to our review.pug and we'll swamp out this

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:45.260 line:100% position:50% align:middle
review author with actually
the markup that we need.

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:51.740 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we need image of the class of avatar,
and the source attribute is going to be

00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:56.660 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the review.author.gravatar. Right? We're
accessing a virtual property of a

00:10:56.660 --> 00:11:01.230 line:100% position:50% align:middle
populated document. And then below that,
we'll have a paragraph tag which has your

00:11:01.230 --> 00:11:09.170 line:100% position:50% align:middle
review.author.name. See what that gives
us. Good, we got three pictures of myself,

00:11:09.170 --> 00:11:14.260 line:100% position:50% align:middle
three names that are now being populated.
Then in the stars, what we're going to do

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:19.940 line:100% position:50% align:middle
is we're going to give that a title of
"Rated..." And we'll take the

00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:29.380 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"reviews.rating," of five stars. See what
that gives us. It's not going to show us

00:11:29.380 --> 00:11:32.770 line:100% position:50% align:middle
anything, but if we inspect it now. Rated
five out of five stars.

00:11:32.770 --> 00:11:35.640 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Good. So that we're pulling that in,
that's get for accessibility's sake.

00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:40.500 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And then, inside of that, we're going to
have an equals, and I'm going to take -

00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:44.560 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you might need to go find this online -
this is a unicode star,

00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:49.850 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and I call "repeat," because it's a
string, "review.rating." That's going to

00:11:49.850 --> 00:11:55.430 line:100% position:50% align:middle
tell us how many...so if I rated it five,
it's going to give us five stars.

00:11:55.430 --> 00:11:58.830 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Beautiful. I rated this one five stars
three times. Let me give me two stars.

00:11:58.830 --> 00:12:06.640 line:100% position:50% align:middle
There we go. Meh. Two stars. But then I
also what to show the empty stars for the

00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:09.390 line:100% position:50% align:middle
rest of them. So below it, I'm going to
say "equals" and I'm going to give

00:12:09.390 --> 00:12:15.310 line:100% position:50% align:middle
ourselves the empty star, and we'll call
it "repeat(5 - review.rating)." So if I

00:12:15.310 --> 00:12:20.940 line:100% position:50% align:middle
gave it two, there's going to be three
empty stars that get repeated.

00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:24.530 line:100% position:50% align:middle
There we go. So two out of five. That's a
nice little way. And the reason why I had

00:12:24.530 --> 00:12:28.300 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to do this title here is because it's not
accessible to just show somebody a bunch

00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:32.270 line:100% position:50% align:middle
of stars on the page and get them to
figure it out. So you need to be able

00:12:32.270 --> 00:12:35.620 line:100% position:50% align:middle
allow those of you
[inaudible] to read that.

00:12:35.620 --> 00:12:41.260 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Finally, the review time. You always
should have a "datetime=review.created."

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:47.850 line:100% position:50% align:middle
What that will do is it will give a time
stamp to screen readers and Google bots

00:12:47.850 --> 00:12:52.090 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and everything like that. That's how a
time tag should be properly formatted.

00:12:52.090 --> 00:12:56.310 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Inside of it, we're going to take our
h.moment. Ah! If you've ever used moment

00:12:56.310 --> 00:13:00.540 line:100% position:50% align:middle
js, that's a library, and if we open our
helpers.js, you'll see that I've just put

00:13:00.540 --> 00:13:06.020 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the entire moment js library in our
helpers, so that I can use it.

00:13:06.020 --> 00:13:11.480 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we say, "h.moment, review.created." And
then we can use a method called

00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:16.490 line:100% position:50% align:middle
".fromNow." So what this will do is it
will make a moment js object,

00:13:16.490 --> 00:13:20.520 line:100% position:50% align:middle
which allows us to call these handy little
methods like, "from now," which should

00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:26.410 line:100% position:50% align:middle
give us a, kind of like a "14 minutes ago,
29 minutes ago, a minute ago," and then

00:13:26.410 --> 00:13:29.340 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it'll give you months and years, and all.
It'll format it really really nicely, too.

00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:35.390 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So that's a cool use for passing libraries
to your helper. Put them on your h.helper

00:13:35.390 --> 00:13:39.390 line:100% position:50% align:middle
valuable, and you have access to them
anywhere inside of you actual template.

00:13:39.390 --> 00:13:43.200 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So this is our whole reviews that we've
got up and running. I know that was quite

00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:47.270 line:100% position:50% align:middle
a bit, so I would probably at this point
take a quick review of everything that we

00:13:47.270 --> 00:13:52.010 line:100% position:50% align:middle
did, specifically adding the auto
populate, as well as when we are in our

00:13:52.010 --> 00:13:59.230 line:100% position:50% align:middle
store.js, we did the virtual fields that
have a external document that hooks up to

00:13:59.230 --> 00:14:00.121 line:100% position:50% align:middle
itself.

00:14:00.121 --> 00:14:04.730 line:100% position:50% align:middle
In the next one, we are going to hook up
this top page, we take an average of all

00:14:04.730 --> 00:14:08.167 line:100% position:50% align:middle
their reviews and get us to
some advanced aggregation.

00:14:08.167 --> 00:14:11.167 line:100% position:50% align:middle
