00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:16.520 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So far we have stores and we have users,
but we don't have any way to sort of

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:20.580 line:100% position:50% align:middle
connect the two. And essentially when
we're creating a store, we need to be able

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.880 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to set an author property on our stores
that is linked to one of the users in our

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.820 line:100% position:50% align:middle
database. That's what's called a
relationship, and this is how we're going

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:34.130 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to create a relationship in MongoDB. So
what we do is we're going to open up our

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:39.030 line:100% position:50% align:middle
store model here, so store.js, and we're
going to scroll down to the bottom where

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.570 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it says photo: String. And we're going to
add a new field called an author.

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:45.190 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And the author's going to be an object.

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:52.190 line:100% position:50% align:middle
The type of the author is not going to be
a String. It's not going to be a Number.

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:57.060 line:100% position:50% align:middle
It's actually going to be an ObjectID.
Hmm, interesting. Well,

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:01.070 line:100% position:50% align:middle
let's look at our users here, and we look
at our Documents here.

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:08.190 line:100% position:50% align:middle
You're going to see that the ID of a
person is not a string, as we have here.

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:12.780 line:100% position:50% align:middle
It's not a date, as we have here. It's not
a number. It's not anything else that we

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.820 line:100% position:50% align:middle
could use. The ID is actually its own
type. And you'll see that it's a type

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:23.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
called an ObjectID. And that's what we
want to set the author to be because it's

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.980 line:100% position:50% align:middle
going to be a relationship between the
store and the actual user.

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:31.730 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So the type is going to be
mongoose.capital "S," schema. And then we

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:37.390 line:100% position:50% align:middle
say ObjectID, so that's a custom type that
we have here. And then we say the ref is

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:44.870 line:100% position:50% align:middle
going to be 'User'. Ah, so this is where
we tell MongoDB in our Schema that the

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:49.440 line:100% position:50% align:middle
author is going to be referenced to our
User. Let's open that up real quick,

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:55.070 line:100% position:50% align:middle
User.js. Let's scroll down here. You see
that the User is right here with a capital

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:59.580 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"U," User, the model called that. So we're
telling it, "This is going to be an

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:04.010 line:100% position:50% align:middle
object." But when somebody gives us an
ObjectID, we're going to store just the

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:07.040 line:100% position:50% align:middle
object, and it's going to be
referenced to the actual User.

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:11.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we're going to be able to come back and
populate the author of each of our stores

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.770 line:100% position:50% align:middle
without having to save all the data about
myself. We just simply have a pointer

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:20.700 line:100% position:50% align:middle
arrow to another piece of data, another
document which is going to be Wes,

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.330 line:100% position:50% align:middle
or whatever is on there. And then finally,
we can make this required.

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.760 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Just say 'You must supply an author'. And
in our case, it's always going to be past

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:33.230 line:100% position:50% align:middle
because we're going to do it as we save a
store. So we'll give that a Save now.

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:38.540 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And when we create a store here, it
actually needs to have an author

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:47.110 line:100% position:50% align:middle
associated with it. So let's open up our
storeController and let's go to our

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:50.750 line:100% position:50% align:middle
createStore method. Here we go,
exports.createStore. And what we're going

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:56.520 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to do before we even create the store,
we're just going to say req.body.author,

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:01.550 line:100% position:50% align:middle
because that's the new field that we're
working with, =, now how do we get the

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:08.790 line:100% position:50% align:middle
current user's ID? Well, req.user._id;.
And what that will do is it will take the

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:13.610 line:100% position:50% align:middle
ID of the currently logged in user, and
it's going to put it into the author

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:18.040 line:100% position:50% align:middle
field. And now when we actually create a
store, what's going to happen is that we

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.420 line:100% position:50% align:middle
will be able to populate that data.

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:25.720 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So give that a Save. Let's try and log in
here. We're going to create a new store

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:32.650 line:100% position:50% align:middle
real quick. So just went ahead and created
our new store. Now if we look that up in

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:38.580 line:100% position:50% align:middle
our MongoDB here, go to stores and we
scroll down all the way to the bottom.

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:45.167 line:100% position:50% align:middle
You see "New Store." You'll see that the
author is ObjectID('58f4d5.

00:03:45.167 --> 00:03:54.360 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And if we go back to our users, you'll see
that wesbos is 58f4d5.

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:59.610 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So the ObjectID is now our relationship
between the two. And what we're able to

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:06.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
do, if we go to store.pug, and we just do
a quick dump of the store somewhere.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.700 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So pre= h.dump(store).

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:19.080 line:100% position:50% align:middle
You'll see that the author property comes
along with us, but it's just an actual ID.

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:23.330 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now if we were to do something called a
"populate," what it will do is it will

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:27.250 line:100% position:50% align:middle
bring along all the information about that
author and put it in here.

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:32.260 line:100% position:50% align:middle
It's going to replace it with the actual
author data. So let's find our

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:40.020 line:100% position:50% align:middle
storeController. Let's go to where we get
a store, which is going to be

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:48.220 line:100% position:50% align:middle
getStoreBySlug. And in here we're doing
Store.findOne. And if you do .populate on

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:53.030 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the end, and you ask it to populate the
('author') field, just by adding that

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:59.020 line:100% position:50% align:middle
populate on the end it should then say,
"Oh, this field needs to be populated so

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:03.540 line:100% position:50% align:middle
let me go off and find the actual document
that's associated with this ID,

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:05.170 line:100% position:50% align:middle
rather than just giving them the ID."

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:08.930 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So if I refresh now, a-ha, there we go. We
have our author with an ID,

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:12.530 line:100% position:50% align:middle
an email, a name. And then we also see the
PasswordToken stuff,

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:15.510 line:100% position:50% align:middle
just because I requested a reset and it
actually didn't reset my password.

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:19.720 line:100% position:50% align:middle
If I did, those would be deleted no
problem. So if you need to populate some

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:24.780 line:100% position:50% align:middle
fields, you simply just say .populate on
the end and it will go off and find the

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:29.390 line:100% position:50% align:middle
associated document for that person and
fill it in for you. So that's really nice

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:32.980 line:100% position:50% align:middle
because we have one document here. We only
have to find one store,

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:37.410 line:100% position:50% align:middle
but by calling populate it will fill in
the additional data that we need.

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:40.920 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Good. So in this case I don't necessarily
need it and you should also be careful

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:44.170 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that you're not accidentally leaking any
of your user sensitive data.

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:47.180 line:100% position:50% align:middle
You'll see that the password, and the
hash, and the salt, none of that stuff is

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:50.880 line:100% position:50% align:middle
automatically populated because it's
sensitive information. But sometimes you

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:54.710 line:100% position:50% align:middle
do need the email. Other times you
shouldn't be printing it out.

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:56.160 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So that's our first part right here.

00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:02.940 line:100% position:50% align:middle
The second part is we need to be able to
stop people from editing stores which they

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:09.510 line:100% position:50% align:middle
do not own. So where do we have...let's go
to our...here's our editStore layout.

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:13.580 line:100% position:50% align:middle
What we need to do right here is before
they can actually edit the store,

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:20.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we need to confirm that they are the
actual owner. So what we'll do is maybe

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.390 line:100% position:50% align:middle
right above this editStore we'll make a
new function here. We'll call it

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:31.860 line:100% position:50% align:middle
confirmOwner. So say const confirmOwner =,
it's a function that takes in a store and

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:37.030 line:100% position:50% align:middle
takes in a user. It's going to check if
the user and the store are the same thing.

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:43.880 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we'll say if there is
(!store.author.equals). So equals is a

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:50.230 line:100% position:50% align:middle
method that comes along. Why? Because the
store.author is going to be an ObjectID.

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:55.560 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And in order to compare an ObjectID with
an actual string you need to use the

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:57.770 line:100% position:50% align:middle
.equals method that lives inside of it.

00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:03.990 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We check if it's equal to the user._id,
and in this case we're checking for not,

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:08.288 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that's what the bang is. So if the store
author is not equal to the (user._id),

00:07:08.288 --> 00:07:15.850 line:100% position:50% align:middle
then we're just going to throw an
Error that says ('You must own a store in

00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:21.900 line:100% position:50% align:middle
order to edit it!');. So in this case, we
are going to be doing this not as

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:26.510 line:100% position:50% align:middle
middleware because we actually need to
find the store before we can do a check.

00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:31.070 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So what we're doing here is we're making a
function called confirmOwner.

00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:36.570 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And before we actually render it out, but
after we have found the store,

00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:40.080 line:100% position:50% align:middle
which is why we have this TODO here. We're
just going to run that function,

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:44.660 line:100% position:50% align:middle
confirmOwner, then we're going to pass it
the store. Then we're going to pass it the

00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:48.410 line:100% position:50% align:middle
current owner, or the current
user, which is req.user.

00:07:48.410 --> 00:07:54.840 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And what this will do is if they are the
owner, then it's going to just keep going.

00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:59.040 line:100% position:50% align:middle
If they are not, it's going to throw an
Error, which hopefully means that our

00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:03.240 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Error handling middleware will pick up
this actual error from happening.

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:07.470 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We'll give it a refresh. And I'll go back
to my thing right here.

00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:11.670 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I'm going to find the only one that has an
author is this New Store right here.

00:08:11.670 --> 00:08:15.270 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And if I click on edit, it lets
me edit it no problem.

00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:19.880 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Let's go to one of these stores that
doesn't have an author, Coffee Shop.

00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:24.280 line:100% position:50% align:middle
It tells me...oh, in this case we actually
hit an error altogether because we sort of

00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:28.110 line:100% position:50% align:middle
have incomplete data because some stores
don't have authors because they were

00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:33.800 line:100% position:50% align:middle
created before we actually had some users.
So what we have to do now is go to our

00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:38.050 line:100% position:50% align:middle
actual MongoDB database, go to our stores,
and we have to delete everything that

00:08:38.050 --> 00:08:42.450 line:100% position:50% align:middle
doesn't have an actual author. So real
quick I'm just going to super speed delete

00:08:42.450 --> 00:08:44.371 line:100% position:50% align:middle
them all except for that
one that we just made.

00:08:44.371 --> 00:08:45.639 line:100% position:50% align:middle
You should do this, too.

00:08:49.450 --> 00:08:52.740 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Make sure you hit Refresh a couple times
on here to make sure that you only have

00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:56.110 line:100% position:50% align:middle
your new store. This may be solved by the
time you're viewing this,

00:08:56.110 --> 00:09:00.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
but it does seem that if you delete things
it doesn't actually delete it sometimes.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.950 line:100% position:50% align:middle
A bit of a bug in the software right now.
So we go back to our home page.

00:09:03.950 --> 00:09:09.070 line:100% position:50% align:middle
You should just see one store. Now I'm
going to log out and I'm going to register

00:09:09.070 --> 00:09:13.630 line:100% position:50% align:middle
under a new email address.
So I'll say "Randy," and I'll say

00:09:13.630 --> 00:09:19.330 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"wesbos+randy@gmail.com." That's another
way that you can make a fake email address

00:09:19.330 --> 00:09:25.920 line:100% position:50% align:middle
here. The password is going to be "wes,
wes." Good. Register. I'm logged in.

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:32.390 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I'm going to now create a new store, which
is going to be "Randy's Joint,

00:09:32.390 --> 00:09:40.300 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Good BBQ." Upload a nice little file here.
Now let's see, Randy's Donuts,

00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:44.200 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Inglewood, CA. Sounds like
a nice place. And Save.

00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:49.060 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Good. So we've created two joints now.
We've got Randy's Joints and the New

00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:52.960 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Store. I shouldn't be able to edit New
Store because I did not create that.

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:56.390 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Again, I'm logged in as Randy right now.
So edit it, there we go.

00:09:56.390 --> 00:10:00.080 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"You must own a store to edit it!" Right?
And all we did there is throw the Error

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:06.540 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and it shows us here. We could have also
had flashed an error and redirected them.

00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:12.030 line:100% position:50% align:middle
But in this case, I've just threw the
actual Error and it will bring us to that

00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:16.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
error message right here. Otherwise, I
should be able to edit this one because I

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.790 line:100% position:50% align:middle
made it. And there we go, I can see it.

00:10:18.790 --> 00:10:22.270 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So let's update our interface real quick.
I shouldn't be able to see this pencil

00:10:22.270 --> 00:10:26.980 line:100% position:50% align:middle
icon right here. I should only see the
pencil icon if I actually own the store.

00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:35.080 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So let's open up our storeCard .pug, and
you see that we have these three lines

00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:38.960 line:100% position:50% align:middle
right here where we have the edit. Right
above it we're going to say if,

00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:48.080 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and we're going to say store.author.equals
the (user._id), then we are going to go

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:56.160 line:100% position:50% align:middle
ahead and show it. Now previously I said
store.author.id equals,

00:10:56.160 --> 00:11:00.130 line:100% position:50% align:middle
but in this case it's just
store.author.equals. Why is that? Well,

00:11:00.130 --> 00:11:03.890 line:100% position:50% align:middle
in this case we're not actually populating
the author because we don't need the

00:11:03.890 --> 00:11:07.560 line:100% position:50% align:middle
author in this case. All we need is just
the ID of the author.

00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:12.620 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So you generally only want to populate
fields if you actually need them for each

00:11:12.620 --> 00:11:15.660 line:100% position:50% align:middle
of the stores, otherwise in this case
we're just going to be seeing the ID.

00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:19.560 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And if that doesn't make a whole lot of
sense to you, you can just do a quick pre=

00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:25.110 line:100% position:50% align:middle
h.dump where we take the (store) and
you'll see. Or we can just show the

00:11:25.110 --> 00:11:31.150 line:100% position:50% align:middle
(store.author). And you'll see in this
case it's just an ID, it's not the actual

00:11:31.150 --> 00:11:34.810 line:100% position:50% align:middle
whole populated author because we didn't
need the author in this view.

00:11:34.810 --> 00:11:38.460 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we're using
store.author.equals(user._id).

00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:42.440 line:100% position:50% align:middle
One problem, this works fine. See how I
see edit under Randy but not under this

00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:47.410 line:100% position:50% align:middle
one? If I were to open this in incognito
you'll see that we get an error.

00:11:47.410 --> 00:11:52.410 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And the problem is...well, let's take a
quick look at what it's telling us.

00:11:52.410 --> 00:11:57.740 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"Cannot read property '_id' of null." So
it's trying to find ID of something that

00:11:57.740 --> 00:12:01.920 line:100% position:50% align:middle
doesn't exist, user. And that's because
you're not logged in at this point.

00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:06.990 line:100% position:50% align:middle
This is just a regular person browsing
this website. So if there is no user,

00:12:06.990 --> 00:12:09.560 line:100% position:50% align:middle
there obviously is going
to be no ID property.

00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:14.560 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So what we need to do is check first if
there's a user, so if user &amp;&amp;

00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:20.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
store.author. So if this is false it's not
going to try to evaluate this part.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.740 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we first check if there's a user, and
if there is we're going to check if the

00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:28.110 line:100% position:50% align:middle
store author is equal to the user._id. So
we just need to make sure that you catch

00:12:28.110 --> 00:12:32.040 line:100% position:50% align:middle
little edge cases like that because logged
in and logged out states can be different.

00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:35.060 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Give that a refresh, there we go. This
person can't edit anything because they're

00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:38.900 line:100% position:50% align:middle
not logged in. But here,
I'm on Randy's Joint.

00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:45.570 line:100% position:50% align:middle
If I do a quick log out and log in, now
I'm able to edit this one because that's

00:12:45.570 --> 00:12:49.820 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the one I had previously made and I'm not
able to edit Randy's Joint because I am

00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:54.370 line:100% position:50% align:middle
not able to edit that. So that's very
basic permissions. What you could also do,

00:12:54.370 --> 00:12:59.580 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and I've done this previously, is you have
different levels. So a level 1 would be

00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:05.300 line:100% position:50% align:middle
able, like an Admin. A level 2 would be an
Editor. Or I do a level 10 and a level 20

00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:09.750 line:100% position:50% align:middle
just so I have some room in between in
case I want to make an in-between,

00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:12.540 line:100% position:50% align:middle
like an adminEditor where they have some
features and not.

00:13:12.540 --> 00:13:17.530 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And then what you could do at this point
is you could create additional

00:13:17.530 --> 00:13:22.890 line:100% position:50% align:middle
confirmOwner. You could say if the store
author equals (user._id),

00:13:22.890 --> 00:13:30.070 line:100% position:50% align:middle
or the user.level is > or < than 10. And
then you say, if they are like an admin,

00:13:30.070 --> 00:13:35.160 line:100% position:50% align:middle
then anyone can actually go ahead and edit
it. So you can really make that a lot more

00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:38.110 line:100% position:50% align:middle
complicated if you need to have admin and
different types of users.

00:13:38.110 --> 00:13:41.350 line:100% position:50% align:middle
But in this case we're just going to stick
to being able...the person that created it

00:13:41.350 --> 00:13:45.290 line:100% position:50% align:middle
is the only one that will be able to
actually edit it. Delete this.

00:13:45.290 --> 00:13:48.440 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So now that we've locked down both the
interface, being able to edit it,

00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:53.070 line:100% position:50% align:middle
as well as confirmed that the person is an
owner once they try to actually edit and

00:13:53.070 --> 00:13:58.070 line:100% position:50% align:middle
update an actual store, let's move onto
our next piece of this application,

00:13:58.070 --> 00:14:00.842 line:100% position:50% align:middle
which is working and building with an API.

00:14:00.842 --> 00:14:03.842 line:100% position:50% align:middle
