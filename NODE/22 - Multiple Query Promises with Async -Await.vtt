In this video, we're going to keep going
with our tags crusade,

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:20.360 line:100% position:50% align:middle
but we're going to do the filtering so
that when you click on a specific tag,

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:24.940 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you're going to see all of the stores
associated with that one tag.

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:29.650 line:100% position:50% align:middle
This is the first time we're doing two
queries inside of one controller method.

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:32.910 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So how do we do that? Well, what we could
do is we can say tags equals that,

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.626 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and we could say const -
if we could spell it right -

00:00:35.626 --> 00:00:39.436 line:100% position:50% align:middle
'const stores = await store.find'

00:00:39.436 --> 00:00:43.760 line:100% position:50% align:middle
blah blah blah blah blah.
But the problem with that is that 'await'

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.960 line:100% position:50% align:middle
does exactly that. It waits, meaning
that we're going to first search for the

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:52.970 line:100% position:50% align:middle
tags, then they'll come back. And then
second, we're going to then go and find

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:56.380 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the latest ten stores or all of the stores
depending on how we want to do it.

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:00.400 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now, that's not really great, because
that's synchronous, meaning that we

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:04.090 line:100% position:50% align:middle
shouldn't be...if these two things are not
dependent on each other,

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:07.980 line:100% position:50% align:middle
they should be fired off at the exact same
time, because that's going to be the

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:13.540 line:100% position:50% align:middle
absolute fastest. If you're making six
different ajax calls and none of them need

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.760 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to wait on the other ones, then you should
make them all at the same time,

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:20.170 line:100% position:50% align:middle
not wait for one to come back and then do
the second, and then wait for the second

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:26.250 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to come back, etc., etc. So what we want
to do instead is to say tags promise

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.670 line:100% position:50% align:middle
equals, and we'll get rid of this await
here. We're going to bring it back in just

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:36.070 line:100% position:50% align:middle
a second. But we put a tags promise into
there, we store the promise,

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:41.260 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that's going to fire it off, and then
we're going to make a stores promise for a

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:47.360 line:100% position:50% align:middle
similar thing. So it's like const stores
promise is equal to store dot find,

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:56.070 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and now we also want to find where the
tags property includes our specific tag.

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Actually, we're going to have to bring
this tag variable up above it, because we

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.930 line:100% position:50% align:middle
need it. So first of all, this will get
our tags list. We did that last time.

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:10.790 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Second of all, this will find all of the
stores where the tags property of a store

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:15.860 line:100% position:50% align:middle
includes that specific tag. And there's no
weird thing that you have to do here where

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:22.030 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it's tags dot includes. If the tag is
wi-fi and the tags array includes wi-fi,

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:26.350 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it will filter it out for us. So now we
have these two promises, but we don't have

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:32.840 line:100% position:50% align:middle
any of the actual data. So what we can
do in here now is we can await for both

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.020 line:100% position:50% align:middle
of these things to come back. If this
thing takes one second and this thing

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:40.963 line:100% position:50% align:middle
takes half a second, we're going to wait
one second, because that's the slowest

00:02:40.963 --> 00:02:46.428 line:100% position:50% align:middle
one. So the way that you can wait for
multiple promises to come back is with

00:02:46.428 --> 00:02:57.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
something called 'promise.all.' So we can
say 'const result = promise.all,'

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
pass it an array of promises. So what
are our two promises?

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:06.558 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Well, we have a tags promise, and we have
a stores promise, which is going to return

00:03:06.558 --> 00:03:11.440 line:100% position:50% align:middle
us an array of actual data in
result. Now a couple things again here,

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:16.440 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we need to await that promise. So rather
than awaiting each individual one,

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:22.360 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we're going to await all of them from
returning, and the result of that is going

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:28.100 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to be put into result, okay? So let's
comment out that res.render, and let's

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:32.860 line:100% position:50% align:middle
just say 'res.JSON result.' See what
we're dealing with here when we hit this

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:39.460 line:100% position:50% align:middle
page. We're on vegetarian. We have three,
a refresh. It should give us first an

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:43.760 line:100% position:50% align:middle
array where the first thing of the array
is another array of tags,

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:51.090 line:100% position:50% align:middle
good. And then the second thing in the
array is a list of coffee shops that all

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:57.100 line:100% position:50% align:middle
have vegetarian in their actual values.
Good. So you could do this.

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:05.910 line:100% position:50% align:middle
You could say if our tags equals results
square bracket zero and if our stores

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:10.320 line:100% position:50% align:middle
equals alt one where the first thing is
going to be the tags, the second thing is

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:13.950 line:100% position:50% align:middle
going to be stores. But again, if you've
taken my ES6 course, you'll know that we

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:18.380 line:100% position:50% align:middle
could destructure that result immediately
by instead of saying result,

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:22.780 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we simply just destructure it into
variables immediately saying tags and

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:27.570 line:100% position:50% align:middle
stores is equal to await promise.alt
tags promise and stores promise.

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:31.960 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So, whew! Two queries, each returns a
promise, and we wait for both of them to

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:36.560 line:100% position:50% align:middle
come back with await. Then we destructure
them into their own variable called tags

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:41.260 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and stores. Now if you say 'res.JSON'
tags, you should just see the tags.

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:46.480 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And if you res.JSON these stores, you
should just see the stores.

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:50.570 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Good. Good, good, good. But we don't want
to JSON it, we'll bring back this render

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:56.480 line:100% position:50% align:middle
function that we have here, and we will
pass along these stores as well.

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:02.550 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Good. We'll now refresh this page. We see
vegetarian. We see our list of tags.

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:07.650 line:100% position:50% align:middle
That didn't get messed up at all. We can
go back into here, take a quick dump,

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:17.880 line:100% position:50% align:middle
pre equals h.dump stores. See there's
our list of possible stores, and now it's

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:20.970 line:100% position:50% align:middle
just a templating problem. We've got all
the data to where we want it.

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:25.470 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We can just go out and start to template
it. So we'll say dot stores,

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:30.580 line:100% position:50% align:middle
each store in stores, and we can reuse our
store card that we made earlier.

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:36.350 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Let's go up here and import that stores
card. So we'll say include,

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:43.160 line:100% position:50% align:middle
mixins/store card, and
then we can use that mixin here saying

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:51.400 line:100% position:50% align:middle
store card, pass the A store. Does that
work? So again, store card is what we used

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:56.060 line:100% position:50% align:middle
on the home page, so we could show our
each of our stores. Refresh.

00:05:56.060 --> 00:06:01.547 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Beautiful. And now I should be able to
flip from one tag page to another, and

00:06:01.547 --> 00:06:05.760 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it's going to immediately filter all of
those items for us. Now that's not totally

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:10.740 line:100% position:50% align:middle
perfect, because if you go to tags page
now, we don't see anything, because there

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:16.380 line:100% position:50% align:middle
is no tag specified. So what we can do is
show all of the stores on this tag page

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:19.770 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and then when you click through to a
specific tag page, like family friendly,

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:24.510 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we'll then filter off for each of those.
So that's what we need to do now.

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:28.635 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We take this tag here, and we're going to
take it out, and above here, we're

00:06:28.635 --> 00:06:34.420 line:100% position:50% align:middle
going to say const tag query is equal to,
it's either going to be the tag or

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:40.540 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it's going to be a property that's called
exists true. What this will do is if there

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:45.535 line:100% position:50% align:middle
is no tag, it's just going to fall back
to the second query which is, just give

00:06:45.535 --> 00:06:51.320 line:100% position:50% align:middle
me any store that has a tag property on it
and then it will show us every single

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:56.770 line:100% position:50% align:middle
store that has at least one tag on it. And
we take this tag query variable and pass

00:06:56.770 --> 00:07:02.460 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it in here. So, whew! Let's see what we've
got here. Refresh. There we go.

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:06.570 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So now we're showing absolutely everything
that has a tag, then we can filter for

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:09.553 line:100% position:50% align:middle
specific ones as we need it there.

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:13.800 line:100% position:50% align:middle
