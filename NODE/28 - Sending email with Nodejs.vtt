In this video, we're going to learn all
about sending email with Node.js,

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:21.890 line:100% position:50% align:middle
as well as taking a Pug file, converting
it to an HTML-ready email,

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:25.200 line:100% position:50% align:middle
as well as then taking your CSS and
inlining it. Because if you've ever done

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.710 line:100% position:50% align:middle
HTML email before, you know that, first,
it's a nightmare. It's really,

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:34.180 line:100% position:50% align:middle
really hard. And second, it needs to make
sure that your CSS has been inlined into

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:37.330 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it in order to make sure that it works
across all the different email clients.

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:41.660 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So whenever you're doing email sending in
a development environment,

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:45.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I use something called Mailtrap. Now
there's a number of different services out

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.720 line:100% position:50% align:middle
there. This is a free freemium one. It
works for 20 sends, and then you delete

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.770 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the older ones and you get new ones. But
essentially what it does is,

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.580 line:100% position:50% align:middle
rather than set it up with an SMTP server,
something like I personally use Postmark

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:05.440 line:100% position:50% align:middle
app to send all of my real email. But when
I'm in development mode I'll use Mailtrap.

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.100 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And what this does is that it fakes being
a mail server.

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.850 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And then anytime you send mail to this
fake mail server, it will,

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.040 line:100% position:50% align:middle
instead of actually sending it to your
users it will just put it into this

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.840 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Mailtrap and you'll be able to quickly see
who the emails are being sent to,

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.350 line:100% position:50% align:middle
what they look like, when they've been
sent. And you don't have to worry about

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:30.060 line:100% position:50% align:middle
going to your own Gmail account, or
accidentally, which is a nightmare

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:36.070 line:100% position:50% align:middle
situation, accidentally sending some email
out to some users which you had real data

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:38.360 line:100% position:50% align:middle
but were in development mode.

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:43.220 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So go on over to mailtrap.io, and sign up
for an account. And I know there's other

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.010 line:100% position:50% align:middle
services that do this, so if you have a
personal preference of one that you

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:51.320 line:100% position:50% align:middle
prefer, there's self-hosted versions as
well. Feel free to go and set that up

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:57.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
right now. Now once you are signed up,
you're going to have access to your SMTP

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.130 line:100% position:50% align:middle
credentials. We are going to be making
what's called a transport with something

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.220 line:100% position:50% align:middle
called nodemailer, and we need all of
these credentials. So you tell me,

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:11.340 line:100% position:50% align:middle
where does sensitive information go? Well,
it goes into our variables.env file.

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.900 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Open up our variables.env file. The PORT
and HOST are already setup for Mailtrap,

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.980 line:100% position:50% align:middle
so if you're using Mailtrap you can keep
those the same. You see here,

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:25.930 line:100% position:50% align:middle
2525, as well as mailtrap.io is the actual
host. Then the Username we can just take

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.860 line:100% position:50% align:middle
right from here. And the Password we can
take right from here.

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.710 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Good. So now whenever we try to send email
with these credentials,

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:37.220 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it's not going to actually make it to
anyone's inbox. It's going to be trapped

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:38.530 line:100% position:50% align:middle
with Mailtrap.

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.590 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Good. Now in order to actually send email
we need to make a new,

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:45.310 line:100% position:50% align:middle
what I like to call, handler. So open up
your handlers, and we're going to make one

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:49.830 line:100% position:50% align:middle
called mail.js. There's a couple different
packages we need in order to send email.

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:53.250 line:100% position:50% align:middle
The first one is one called nodemailer.
And nodemailer is really,

00:02:53.250 --> 00:03:00.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
really great because what it will do is it
will interface with SMTP or any number of

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.230 line:100% position:50% align:middle
different what are called transports. And
it will do the sending of the email for

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:09.270 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you. So I'll say const nodemailer, and
require it.

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:15.440 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We also need something called pug, juice,
htmlToText, and our promisify library.

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:19.415 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So I'm just going to type those in super
speed here, and make sure you grab them as

00:03:19.415 --> 00:03:20.500 line:100% position:50% align:middle
well.

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:29.260 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Good. So I'll explain what all of these
are in just a second, but right now what

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:33.470 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we need to know is that we have our
nodemailer being set up. And we have to

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:36.810 line:100% position:50% align:middle
create what's called a transport. And a
transport is a way that you interface with

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:42.190 line:100% position:50% align:middle
different ways of sending email, SMTP
being the most common. So we'll say const

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:50.050 line:100% position:50% align:middle
transport = nodemailer.createTransport.
That takes an object where you have a

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.650 line:100% position:50% align:middle
host.

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:55.010 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And now the host is going to be taken from
here, right? Just as we did everything

00:03:55.010 --> 00:04:01.910 line:100% position:50% align:middle
else as a process.env. MAIL_HOST. We have
a port, which is going to be the exact

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:07.740 line:100% position:50% align:middle
same but _port. Then we have an auth
object. Inside of that, you have a user,

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:15.290 line:100% position:50% align:middle
which is going to be MAIL_...well, that
should be "PORT." MAIL_USER.

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:20.820 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And then we have a pass, which is going to
be MAIL_PASS. Good.

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:26.630 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So what we just did there is we created a
transport. And we can try to send a piece

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:31.320 line:100% position:50% align:middle
of email immediately. So if you ever just
want to make sure that something works,

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:36.380 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you can actually just code right in here.
And whenever the server starts up it will

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:38.080 line:100% position:50% align:middle
send that email.

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:43.390 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we can take our transport and
call.sendMail, and sendMail is going to

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:50.030 line:100% position:50% align:middle
take some options here which will have a
from Wes Bos, a to. I'll say

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:59.486 line:100% position:50% align:middle
randy@example.com. A subject: 'Just trying
things out!'

00:04:59.486 --> 00:05:07.010 line:100% position:50% align:middle
The html is going to be
'Hey I, ' we'll put some HTML in here

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:14.010 line:100% position:50% align:middle
strong love strong you. ' And then it also takes a text
for those weirdos that don't get HTML and

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:17.930 line:100% position:50% align:middle
only text. Something like that, that was
just text people can read.

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:22.730 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So good. We have our transport. We're
sending over the mail. Then if we import

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:27.700 line:100% position:50% align:middle
this mail. js file into any one of our
files that's already running,

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:32.070 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it should trigger this on page load and
send us an email. So I'm going to do that

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:38.470 line:100% position:50% align:middle
in start. js. Let's just temporarily do it
at the bottom here.

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:43.790 line:100% position:50% align:middle
TEMP send email. Again, make sure to take
this out later. And we'll just say

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:50.300 line:100% position:50% align:middle
require('. /handlers/mail'). Good, so
don't save it just yet, but clear this

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:57.240 line:100% position:50% align:middle
out. Give it a Save. And you'll see that
it ran. And all of a sudden,

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:01.510 line:100% position:50% align:middle
this refreshed, and I say, "Hey, I love
you. Just trying things out.

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:06.600 line:100% position:50% align:middle
From Wes Bos to Randy@example. com." You
can see the HTML source that we did,

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:10.510 line:100% position:50% align:middle
but you can also see the Text version of
the email that we sent,

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:16.040 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the Raw, the Analysis, the Checking HTML,
etc, etc. So some handy stuff that comes

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:20.490 line:100% position:50% align:middle
along with this MailChimp. Mailtrap, not
MailChimp. That's a different thing.

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:23.830 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Cool. So delete that. We don't need that.
We know that it's actually working.

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:28.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And go back to your mail. js, and again,
get rid of the sendMail as well because

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.300 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we're going to make a method that sort of
encapsulates that. But I just wanted to

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:37.400 line:100% position:50% align:middle
make sure that our host, and port, and
user, and password were done properly.

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:40.990 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now whenever somebody resets their
password, we're going to call a function

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:46.190 line:100% position:50% align:middle
called "send." So we'll say, exports. send
=, we'll make it async,

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:51.260 line:100% position:50% align:middle
(options) takes in some options, and so
I'll make a sends in just a second.

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:56.550 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And we'll open up our curly brackets
there. Good. Now what we want to do is

00:06:56.550 --> 00:07:02.140 line:100% position:50% align:middle
make our mailOption. So there's a const
mailOptions = from, and this is going to

00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:06.090 line:100% position:50% align:middle
be the from. So whatever application you
are doing, and say 'Wes Bos.

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:12.595 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And you can put in the email address in
brackets here, so noreply@wesbos.com.

00:07:12.595 --> 00:07:14.600 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Whatever you want
the from address to be,

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:21.047 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to, this is going to be
send to the options.user.email.

00:07:21.047 --> 00:07:25.050 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we're going to pass in the
user who it needs to be sent to once we

00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:32.020 line:100% position:50% align:middle
find it. The HTML is going to be, say
'This will be filled in later.'

00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:38.370 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And our text properly is 'This will also
be filled in later.'

00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:44.640 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Yeah, so here's our options. Then we
want to go ahead and promisify our

00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:48.500 line:100% position:50% align:middle
sendmail function. Because by default,
again, sendmail will work as a callback.

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:57.620 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We want to promisify it. So we'll say
const sendMail = promisify(transport.

00:07:57.620 --> 00:08:04.500 line:100% position:50% align:middle
sendMail. We'll bind it to the transport .
And transport is the Mailtrap one that we

00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:08.580 line:100% position:50% align:middle
set up. What's beautiful about that is
once you swap out your variables.

00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:13.070 line:100% position:50% align:middle
env for a production one, that'll all just
hook up when you fill it up with something

00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:17.980 line:100% position:50% align:middle
like Postmark app, which actually does
send your email. So const sendMail =

00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:23.380 line:100% position:50% align:middle
promisify. Good, we're going to return
sendMail, and we'll give it the

00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:26.060 line:100% position:50% align:middle
mailOptions that we have there. And the
mailOptions has the from,

00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:29.410 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the to, the html, text. Oh, and one last
thing. We also need the subject,

00:08:29.410 --> 00:08:34.540 line:100% position:50% align:middle
which is going to be the options. subject.
That's going to get passed in.

00:08:34.540 --> 00:08:37.600 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Good. Now we have this little function
that will send mail. And we're going to

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:40.380 line:100% position:50% align:middle
hook it up to actually compile our Pug
files in just a second.

00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:45.380 line:100% position:50% align:middle
But right now we're just going to be
filling it in. And let's go to our

00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:50.390 line:100% position:50% align:middle
password-reset flow and actually get this
to send when we've sent it.

00:08:50.390 --> 00:08:54.490 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So that was in our auth controller. And
we'll take a look. Where was it where we

00:08:54.490 --> 00:08:59.480 line:100% position:50% align:middle
actually sent it? Here we go. In the
function called "forgot," we flashed,

00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:04.440 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"You have been emailed a password reset
link." Okay, good. But we don't want to

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:07.660 line:100% position:50% align:middle
actually send them the URL. Remember, we
were doing that with that variable reset

00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:12.980 line:100% position:50% align:middle
URL? Take that away. And one line above it
we're going to use our mail.

00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:20.160 line:100% position:50% align:middle
send. Okay, well, we need to import this
mail library real quick from here.

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:26.870 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So go to the top, const mail = require. Up
a level, because we're in controllers.

00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:32.070 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Then into our handlers. Then into our
mail. js file. And then we'll go back down

00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:37.210 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to our exports. forgot, and we'll say
mail. send. And there's a couple options

00:09:37.210 --> 00:09:42.100 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that need to be passed. It's one big
object. The user is going to be the actual

00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:47.040 line:100% position:50% align:middle
user that we found when we did our
database query. So the user = the user.

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:56.140 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Or just user. And then the subject is
going to be 'Password Reset.'

00:09:56.140 --> 00:10:02.400 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Then we also need to pass along the
reset URL. So resetURL is going to be

00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:07.910 line:100% position:50% align:middle
equal to resetURL. Or like we've been
doing all along, just resetURL.

00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:14.330 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Good. So we are going to await that mail
to send. And then once it's been sent,

00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:18.730 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we're going to flash a success message and
redirect to a login.

00:10:18.730 --> 00:10:22.760 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So let's see, let's try the reset flow
once more. We'll go back to our

00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:26.800 line:100% position:50% align:middle
application. I'm going to log out. I'm
going to click on Log In.

00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:32.770 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I forgot my password. Send the reset It
says, "You have been emailed a password

00:10:32.770 --> 00:10:37.850 line:100% position:50% align:middle
reset link." If we go back to our Mailtrap
inbox here, we see it.

00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:41.630 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And now see we have a new mail that's
arrived, Password Reset.

00:10:41.630 --> 00:10:46.440 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And we don't see anything other than that
it was sent to the correct address.

00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:52.330 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And the HTML and the text tell us what
will be filled in later.

00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:59.010 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Good. So we have our email sending at the
right point. But now the question is,

00:10:59.010 --> 00:11:05.330 line:100% position:50% align:middle
how do we get the HTML generating? Because
we looked at views>email>email-layout,

00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:10.410 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and password-reset. This was all done in
Pug. How do we convert it from Pug into

00:11:10.410 --> 00:11:14.190 line:100% position:50% align:middle
HTML? And then how do we take our HTML and
our CSS and inline it?

00:11:14.190 --> 00:11:17.070 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So that's what we're going to be doing
next. We'll go back into our mail.

00:11:17.070 --> 00:11:24.510 line:100% position:50% align:middle
js. And we're going to make a function
called generateHTML. So const generateHTML

00:11:24.510 --> 00:11:28.630 line:100% position:50% align:middle
= an arrow function. And that arrow
function's going to take in two things,

00:11:28.630 --> 00:11:33.730 line:100% position:50% align:middle
a filename and an options object, which
will default to just being a blank object.

00:11:33.730 --> 00:11:40.190 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Okay, but why is that not exports.
generateHTML? It's just const.

00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:43.600 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And the reason behind that is because it's
not needed anywhere outside of this mail.

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:49.060 line:100% position:50% align:middle
js file. So we're just going to make it a
regular function here rather than have to

00:11:49.060 --> 00:11:52.560 line:100% position:50% align:middle
export it, because it's not needed
anywhere else. Now we make a variable

00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:56.850 line:100% position:50% align:middle
called html, and we use our Pug library
that we imported right here.

00:11:56.850 --> 00:12:01.180 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And we're going to use one of the methods
on Pug called renderFile.

00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:05.690 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And that will take the name of the actual
file that we're looking for,

00:12:05.690 --> 00:12:09.660 line:100% position:50% align:middle
which in our case is going to get passed
in as password-reset.

00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:14.060 line:100% position:50% align:middle
pug. Now there's a big of a problem here,
because whenever you have render file,

00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:18.290 line:100% position:50% align:middle
or whenever you pass a function reference
to something on your disk,

00:12:18.290 --> 00:12:22.840 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you don't actually know where you are in
the folder system, because of course right

00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:27.710 line:100% position:50% align:middle
now we're in a handlers folder. But this
renderFile folder, it's in a totally

00:12:27.710 --> 00:12:31.510 line:100% position:50% align:middle
different folder. And it gets a little bit
mixed up. So what we can use there is we

00:12:31.510 --> 00:12:35.870 line:100% position:50% align:middle
use backticks. We can use one of these
variables that is available to us in any

00:12:35.870 --> 00:12:40.470 line:100% position:50% align:middle
file, and it's called __dirname. And you
see how it turned blue there?

00:12:40.470 --> 00:12:44.670 line:100% position:50% align:middle
That means my editor knows that that's a
special variable, sort of like window or

00:12:44.670 --> 00:12:48.410 line:100% position:50% align:middle
console in the browser. We have this
variable that's always available to us in

00:12:48.410 --> 00:12:54.120 line:100% position:50% align:middle
every single file. And dirname is going to
be equal to the current directory that we

00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:59.130 line:100% position:50% align:middle
are running this file from, which in our
case is going to be like my hard drive,

00:12:59.130 --> 00:13:04.050 line:100% position:50% align:middle
blah, blah, blah /handlers. So dirname
will give us what we're looking for.

00:13:04.050 --> 00:13:09.210 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Then we will go up a level, so /.. /,
because we don't want to be in the

00:13:09.210 --> 00:13:14.150 line:100% position:50% align:middle
handlers folder. We want to be in the main
folder. And we go into views,

00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:22.320 line:100% position:50% align:middle
into email, and then into the filename.
pug on the end. And then as a second

00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:26.790 line:100% position:50% align:middle
argument we are going to pass the options
that got passed into the render file.

00:13:26.790 --> 00:13:32.160 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And the options is going to contain all
the information, like the reset variable

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:38.720 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and the user's email address. Then what
that will do is... let's just console log.

00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:43.080 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Or let's return the html. And we can
console log the html as well,

00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:47.850 line:100% position:50% align:middle
just so we can see where we're at. And we
can go back into our mailOptions,

00:13:47.850 --> 00:13:51.830 line:100% position:50% align:middle
or right above it. And we can make an HTML
variable and use our new function called

00:13:51.830 --> 00:13:56.830 line:100% position:50% align:middle
generateHTML. What do you need to pass it?
Well, options. filename is going to be the

00:13:56.830 --> 00:14:00.450 line:100% position:50% align:middle
name of the file. And then it also, see,
there we go. It also expects us to pass

00:14:00.450 --> 00:14:09.990 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the options variable as well. So then we
can take that HTML variable and swap out

00:14:09.990 --> 00:14:14.150 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the "This will be filled in later with
HTML," or again, because they're the same

00:14:14.150 --> 00:14:21.060 line:100% position:50% align:middle
thing just html. And when we now run this,
it should go off to our Pug,

00:14:21.060 --> 00:14:26.510 line:100% position:50% align:middle
find this password-reset. pug, generate it
into HTML, return it,

00:14:26.510 --> 00:14:31.010 line:100% position:50% align:middle
which will allow us to then pass it along
to our mailOption. So let's try it,

00:14:31.010 --> 00:14:36.380 line:100% position:50% align:middle
wesbos@gmail. com. Give it a reset. Tells
us it worked properly.

00:14:36.380 --> 00:14:40.720 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Let's go back to our Mailtrap inbox. Don't
see anything. Give it a refresh.

00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:45.850 line:100% position:50% align:middle
There we go, it just showed up. Click it.
Hey, look what's going on here.

00:14:45.850 --> 00:14:49.970 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Password Reset, "Hello, you've requested a
password reset. Please click the following

00:14:49.970 --> 00:14:53.770 line:100% position:50% align:middle
button to continue to reset..." Blah,
blah, blah, blah, blah. And then see this?

00:14:53.770 --> 00:14:59.750 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Localhost:777 account/reset, and then my
token. That's because when we generated

00:14:59.750 --> 00:15:08.690 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the actual resetURL, we passed it via our
mail. send, which then accepted it via

00:15:08.690 --> 00:15:14.660 line:100% position:50% align:middle
mail. send and gave it to all of our Pug
template files. So following me here,

00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:20.640 line:100% position:50% align:middle
then if we look at our password-reset Pug,
we use that variable resetURL inside of

00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:24.340 line:100% position:50% align:middle
here, and that's how it got to my actual
users at the end of the day.

00:15:24.340 --> 00:15:29.260 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So good so far. A couple more things is my
text still says it will be filled in

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:33.210 line:100% position:50% align:middle
later. And also I haven't inlined my CSS,
which is a bit of a problem.

00:15:33.210 --> 00:15:38.120 line:100% position:50% align:middle
It works fine here because I'm on the web,
but if I open the sucker up in Windows XP

00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:42.310 line:100% position:50% align:middle
95, it's not going to work really well
because that CSS should be inlined.

00:15:42.310 --> 00:15:47.120 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we'll head back to our mail. js and
let's deal with the text one first,

00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:51.440 line:100% position:50% align:middle
because that's pretty simple. We imported
a library here called htmlToText.

00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:55.750 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And what that will do is you just give it
HTML and it's going to,

00:15:55.750 --> 00:15:58.930 line:100% position:50% align:middle
guess what? going to give you text. And
what that will do is it will make all of

00:15:58.930 --> 00:16:02.290 line:100% position:50% align:middle
your text-based readers who
answer the email in dim

00:16:02.290 --> 00:16:08.950 line:100% position:50% align:middle
or whatever they're doing. It will give
them a nice, clean HTML-free email and

00:16:08.950 --> 00:16:14.110 line:100% position:50% align:middle
still allow them to read it. So we'll go
here and we'll simply just say const text

00:16:14.110 --> 00:16:21.680 line:100% position:50% align:middle
= htmlToText. fromString, and you pass all
of our HTML. And that's just going to make

00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:25.950 line:100% position:50% align:middle
a nice... format it with spaces and
asterisks around the bold stuff.

00:16:25.950 --> 00:16:31.960 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Let's swap that out here. Or again, just
text. Good. And let's check if the text is

00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:37.770 line:100% position:50% align:middle
now working. So I'm going to say
wesbos@gmail. com. Worked fine.

00:16:37.770 --> 00:16:42.870 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Open up my Password Reset, it looks good.
If I click on Text, you'll see here we go.

00:16:42.870 --> 00:16:48.920 line:100% position:50% align:middle
PASSWORD RESET is all in caps, and it will
then show the person the actual URL that

00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:53.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
they can visit, rather than giving them
any sort of link. So good,

00:16:53.000 --> 00:17:00.060 line:100% position:50% align:middle
good, good. Last thing is, how do you
inline CSS? Well, there is a module called

00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:05.390 line:100% position:50% align:middle
juice. And what it does is you give it
HTML with style tags. And it will take

00:17:05.390 --> 00:17:08.430 line:100% position:50% align:middle
those style tags and it will inline them
in every single paragraph.

00:17:08.430 --> 00:17:12.870 line:100% position:50% align:middle
It will figure out what selectors match
what HTML, and inline all of our CSS for

00:17:12.870 --> 00:17:17.850 line:100% position:50% align:middle
us, which is exactly what you need when
you're running HTML. Because if we look in

00:17:17.850 --> 00:17:24.290 line:100% position:50% align:middle
our console here, you'll see that this is
our actual HTML here,

00:17:24.290 --> 00:17:30.170 line:100% position:50% align:middle
h2 Password Reset. And this CSS here is not
going to apply to any of this HTML in many

00:17:30.170 --> 00:17:37.330 line:100% position:50% align:middle
email clients. So we can go back to our
generateHTML. And what we can do is rather

00:17:37.330 --> 00:17:41.690 line:100% position:50% align:middle
than console log it, we can make a new
variable called inlined and just take

00:17:41.690 --> 00:17:45.950 line:100% position:50% align:middle
juice and pass it the HTML. And it's going
to do all of its work for us.

00:17:45.950 --> 00:17:50.900 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And then rather than returning HTML, we're
going to return inlined.

00:17:50.900 --> 00:17:56.900 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Good, that was easy. Just two little lines
of code. Now if I try to reset my password

00:17:56.900 --> 00:18:00.580 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and go back to my inbox here, it looks
exactly the same for me.

00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:06.260 line:100% position:50% align:middle
But if we click on the HTML source, you'll
see that... it's all in one line.

00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:15.390 line:100% position:50% align:middle
But you see how the body style tag is
inlined? Or the h2 tag has margin-bottom,

00:18:15.390 --> 00:18:19.040 line:100% position:50% align:middle
line-height, font-weight, font-family, it
has all of that stuff inlined.

00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:23.640 line:100% position:50% align:middle
That's exactly what Juice will do, is it
will take all the labor-intensive inlining

00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:27.940 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and just automatically do it for you
without having to use... I use to go to

00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:32.900 line:100% position:50% align:middle
just search for "CSS inliner tool." I
would find the MailChimp one and then I

00:18:32.900 --> 00:18:37.320 line:100% position:50% align:middle
would just paste it into here. And then it
would take my HTML and my CSS and convert

00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:40.600 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it for me. But this will automatically do
absolutely everything for me,

00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:46.540 line:100% position:50% align:middle
which I was really, really happy to do. So
that is sending email with Node.

00:18:46.540 --> 00:18:51.540 line:100% position:50% align:middle
js. It's really nice because you can
re-use this send function over and over

00:18:51.540 --> 00:18:57.020 line:100% position:50% align:middle
again, and really all you need to do is
just pass it a new filename as well as a

00:18:57.020 --> 00:19:02.844 line:100% position:50% align:middle
new subject, and a new user of
who to send that email to.
