00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:16.500 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now, we need to take a look at our Store
Schema here and talk about some custom

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.310 line:100% position:50% align:middle
data types. Why? Because what types do we
have so far? A string,

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.230 line:100% position:50% align:middle
a string, a string, and an array of
strings. So it's important to note that

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.500 line:100% position:50% align:middle
there are many, many types of data that
could be stored in a MongoDB database,

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.680 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and it's really important to before you
actually start storing data,

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.970 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to figure out how your data should be
stored. So let's say, example,

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:43.410 line:100% position:50% align:middle
for a date. When we want to store when a
store was created... We want to store when

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.500 line:100% position:50% align:middle
a store was created, so let's make a
"created" property. The type is not going

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.760 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to be a string. It's not going to be a
number. It's going to be a date.

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.480 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Right? Because that is a real date, and
what that will allow us to do is to do

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:00.570 line:100% position:50% align:middle
complex queries in the future, where users
search for things in a specific month or

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.430 line:100% position:50% align:middle
between these two dates, or are greater
than the following date.

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.750 line:100% position:50% align:middle
MongoDB has a whole bunch of custom
queries for dealing with dates,

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:14.150 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and if you store it as a date, then you
will be able to take advantage of those.

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.420 line:100% position:50% align:middle
When I did one on my projects, I just
stored it as a timestamp,

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.300 line:100% position:50% align:middle
because I thought I was a badass, and I
stored everything as a Unix timestamp.

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:24.970 line:100% position:50% align:middle
But I realized that it's much better to
store it as a real date,

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:28.470 line:100% position:50% align:middle
so you can take advantage of all the
custom queries with MongoDB.

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.840 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now, the default of "date" is just going
to be "date.now". What that will mean is

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:41.290 line:100% position:50% align:middle
when you create a store, it will just
simply set the "created" property to be

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:45.400 line:100% position:50% align:middle
whatever "date.now". If you've never used
"date.now", it's pretty sweet.

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:50.600 line:100% position:50% align:middle
It's a static method on "date" and it will
just tell you what the current time is in

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:56.230 line:100% position:50% align:middle
milliseconds since God created the Earth.
So now, MongoDB, as well as having stuff

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:59.820 line:100% position:50% align:middle
built in for numbers and times, and
strings, it also has a huge feature set

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:06.380 line:100% position:50% align:middle
for dealing specifically with stuff that
is location-based. So it will allow you to

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:11.870 line:100% position:50% align:middle
search based on the coordinates for things
that are within a couple kilometers or a

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.990 line:100% position:50% align:middle
couple miles. Or it will allow you to
search for stores that are within the

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:21.810 line:100% position:50% align:middle
following bounds, or within a province or
a state, wherever it is that you're

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.280 line:100% position:50% align:middle
living. So that's pretty cool, because you
can do these really complex queries and

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:31.400 line:100% position:50% align:middle
not have to do any of the math or any of
the hard query lookups behind it,

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:36.180 line:100% position:50% align:middle
because it's all built into MongoDB. So
we're going to make a "location" property

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:41.460 line:100% position:50% align:middle
here, and that's going to be an object.
Now, there are many ways of storing data,

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:44.630 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and the way that we're going to be doing
it is storing it as a point,

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:50.440 line:100% position:50% align:middle
which is just going to be a pin on a map,
because you could also store a custom

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.380 line:100% position:50% align:middle
location. Maybe if you're outlining a
state, or maybe you're outlining a block

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:57.830 line:100% position:50% align:middle
or a couple streets, that would be
multiple points. But in our case,

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:01.270 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we just have a latitude and longitude and
that's where I'm going to drop the pin on

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:06.130 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the map. So we'll say "type", and the type
itself has to be a little bit weird,

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:11.040 line:100% position:50% align:middle
because it is technically a string. So you
say, "type: String," but you say "default"

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:16.290 line:100% position:50% align:middle
is going to be a point. This seems a
little weird. It took me a while to figure

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:19.420 line:100% position:50% align:middle
this out. But you have a "type" property,
which is the object,

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:24.790 line:100% position:50% align:middle
which has a type of "string" and a default
of "point". Now, we have a couple of sort

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:30.970 line:100% position:50% align:middle
of sub-properties that will live inside of
"location" that make up a point.

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:37.910 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we have "coordinates", and the
"coordinates" is going to be an array of

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:44.370 line:100% position:50% align:middle
lng and lat. If that sounds backwards,
it's because it is. So that is going to be

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:50.040 line:100% position:50% align:middle
an array, and each item in the coordinates
is going to be an object.

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:56.300 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So maybe I'll put this like this. The
coordinates are a type of "number",

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:03.320 line:100% position:50% align:middle
because our coordinates look something
like 43.whatever, and then negative

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:08.170 line:100% position:50% align:middle
131.whatever. So those two values, lat and
lng, those are going to be numbers,

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:13.380 line:100% position:50% align:middle
so type of "numbers". "Required" is going
to be "true", or as we learned earlier,

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:23.490 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"You must supply coordinates!" Then, we
also need an address, because lat and lng

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:27.400 line:100% position:50% align:middle
are not all that useful to a user. It's
helpful for a map, but we also want to

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:32.010 line:100% position:50% align:middle
store the physical address of the
location. So that is going to be a type of

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:38.370 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"string" and "required" is, "You must
supply an address!" Good.

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:42.110 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So I think we've got that now. So I have a
"location" property that has a type of

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:45.860 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"string", which the default is the point.
It has a "coordinates",

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:50.570 line:100% position:50% align:middle
which is going to be an array of numbers,
and it has an address,

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:54.880 line:100% position:50% align:middle
which is going to be a string and both of
those are required. Good.

00:04:54.880 --> 00:05:00.410 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now, the next step is we need to edit our
Edit screen here, in order to accept a

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:06.360 line:100% position:50% align:middle
lat, a lng, and an address. So let's go
back to our "storeForm".

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:10.260 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Oh, before we go to "storeForm", make sure
you take the quotes off the string.

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:13.490 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Why? Because it is a type of "string".
That's a built-in JavaScript type,

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:17.640 line:100% position:50% align:middle
not quote "string", so make sure you take
that off. Now, we'll go over to our

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:22.060 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"storeForm" and start creating an
interface. We're actually adding our

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:25.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
address and our coordinates. So we'll go
to our "storeForm" here,

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.450 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and let's do a little comment. That's how
you comment in Pug, "//-" and we'll just

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:37.430 line:100% position:50% align:middle
say, "address, lat and lng", or let's do
"lng and lat". We'll talk about that in

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:42.680 line:100% position:50% align:middle
just a second. So we need a label for
"address". Give ourselves an input with

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:52.550 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the type of "text", the ID of "address",
and the name of "location[address]".

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:57.420 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now, if you've never seen this syntax
before, what is actually happening,

00:05:57.420 --> 00:06:02.950 line:100% position:50% align:middle
if we open up our App.js and scroll down
to "app.use", see this,

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:08.650 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: true
}))? What that "extended: true" does is it

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:14.700 line:100% position:50% align:middle
allows us to use inputs that sort of have
nested data in them.

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:20.360 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Meaning that this is going to come as
"location.address", because we need

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:25.150 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"location.address" as nested data. So by
putting "[]" and then the name of the

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:31.120 line:100% position:50% align:middle
sub-property, that will allow us to send
nested data without having to do any extra

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:35.320 line:100% position:50% align:middle
heavy lifting, either on the client side
before we send it, or on the server side

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:40.470 line:100% position:50% align:middle
as we receive that data. It's pretty neat.
I really like that feature of Express.

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:46.660 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we have our name of "address", and
let's actually just try that for now.

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:49.760 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We have to add a new one, because there's
a little bit we need to do to edit them.

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:56.870 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we'll go to Add and say, "New Store",
say, "Good eats", and then we'll add an

00:06:56.870 --> 00:07:05.320 line:100% position:50% align:middle
address of 123... Oh, I forgot to add the
x for our label. 123 Fake Street and add a

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:10.200 line:100% position:50% align:middle
couple. So give it a save, and [it'll]
say, "Successfully created New Store.

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:14.230 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Care to leave a review?" Obviously, we
can't see it yet, but we'll go back here,

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:21.990 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we'll go to New Store, and edit it. How
come address isn't filled out?

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:28.060 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Well, that's because we need to set the
value of this to be

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:35.670 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"store.location.address". Give that a save
and refresh. Hey, hey.

00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:39.660 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now, Fake Street is showing up. But I need
to tell you something.

00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:43.310 line:100% position:50% align:middle
You know when you have
"store.location.address"? What if

00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:47.230 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"location" doesn't exist, and you try to
read a property of something that is not

00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:51.770 line:100% position:50% align:middle
an object or does not exist. It's going to
tell you, "Cannot read property address of

00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:55.480 line:100% position:50% align:middle
undefined," because "location" is
undefined. So that's going to be a bit of

00:07:55.480 --> 00:08:00.770 line:100% position:50% align:middle
a problem for when we go to add a new one,
right now. See, we get this error here?

00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:05.520 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"Cannot read property address of
undefined." Why is that? Because we don't

00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:11.300 line:100% position:50% align:middle
have an address yet. So in this case, what
we need to do is to take this value and to

00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:19.330 line:100% position:50% align:middle
wrap it in some parentheses. We'll say,
"store.location &amp;&amp;

00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:26.450 line:100% position:50% align:middle
store.location.address". What that will do
is it will first check if "store.location"

00:08:26.450 --> 00:08:32.220 line:100% position:50% align:middle
exists. If it does, it will go and return
the second thing. If "store.loation" does

00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:36.060 line:100% position:50% align:middle
not exist, it will just return "false", or
it won't return anything and the value

00:08:36.060 --> 00:08:40.770 line:100% position:50% align:middle
will be empty. So that's a nice little way
that we can do sort of a check for that

00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:45.450 line:100% position:50% align:middle
property first, and you can see that it
doesn't error out. But if we were to go to

00:08:45.450 --> 00:08:53.600 line:100% position:50% align:middle
one of our properties here, maybe we'll go
back to Bakery and add in an address,

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:57.930 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"455 Fake Street", save, you see that the
Fake Street is there.

00:08:57.930 --> 00:09:03.390 line:100% position:50% align:middle
If I refresh, the data will always be
coming back. Good. Now, let's do the lng

00:09:03.390 --> 00:09:07.770 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and the lat. So we'll go underneath that
and we'll say, "label(for="lng")",

00:09:07.770 --> 00:09:16.510 line:100% position:50% align:middle
longitude. We'll say, "Address LNG". Then,
we'll have an input with the type of

00:09:16.510 --> 00:09:20.910 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"number". Actually, it should just be type
of "text", because we don't need the...

00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:24.190 line:100% position:50% align:middle
The interface for input type of "number"
will give us the arrows.

00:09:24.190 --> 00:09:28.440 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Why would you ever pick an address with up
and down arrows? Then,

00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:38.500 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the ID is going to be "lng" and the name
is going to be, "location[coordinates]".

00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:42.410 line:100% position:50% align:middle
If we look back at our store,
"coordinates" is an array and the

00:09:42.410 --> 00:09:47.510 line:100% position:50% align:middle
longitude needs to be the first thing. So
I have always done it where it's lat and

00:09:47.510 --> 00:09:53.700 line:100% position:50% align:middle
lng, meaning that lat comes first and lng
comes second. But upon wasting several

00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:59.150 line:100% position:50% align:middle
hours on building this project, I realized
that there is this whole other world of

00:09:59.150 --> 00:10:04.850 line:100% position:50% align:middle
people who build it with lng first and
then lat. So absolutely,

00:10:04.850 --> 00:10:12.070 line:100% position:50% align:middle
100%, make sure that your lng comes first
and your latitude comes second in this

00:10:12.070 --> 00:10:17.630 line:100% position:50% align:middle
array. That's just the way that MongoDB
expects the data to be stored.

00:10:17.630 --> 00:10:20.920 line:100% position:50% align:middle
If you do it the opposite, you're either
going to end up in Australia,

00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:24.390 line:100% position:50% align:middle
or if you're Australian and you come to
Canada, or wherever the [inaudible]

00:10:24.390 --> 00:10:28.530 line:100% position:50% align:middle
of the Earth is. Or it will give
you errors, being like that,

00:10:28.530 --> 00:10:32.140 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"That's not a correct latitude and
longitude." So triple-check it's lng,

00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:37.460 line:100% position:50% align:middle
then lat. Then, we'll just duplicate this
and I'll swap out that for lat,

00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:44.560 line:100% position:50% align:middle
lat, and the second value, which is going
to be one, because it's zero-based.

00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:51.450 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Good. Oh, that should be lat as well.
Let's try giving ourselves some values

00:10:51.450 --> 00:10:58.890 line:100% position:50% align:middle
here. So 127 and negative 43. Give that a
save. The values aren't here,

00:10:58.890 --> 00:11:02.020 line:100% position:50% align:middle
but that's because we haven't actually put
them back into it. So let's try a quick

00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:07.680 line:100% position:50% align:middle
dump of our values again, "pre=
h.dump(store)". Let's see if they're

00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:12.550 line:100% position:50% align:middle
actually even getting stored before we try
to display them. There we go,

00:11:12.550 --> 00:11:18.100 line:100% position:50% align:middle
coordinates, 127, negative 43. So what we
need to do is go to here and say,

00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:24.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"The value equals," and we'll do another
one of these, lng. "Store.location &amp;&amp;

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:31.800 line:100% position:50% align:middle
store.location.coordinates", the first
one. Then, we can just take that whole

00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:40.010 line:100% position:50% align:middle
thing and dip it over for the second one.
Now, when I refresh,

00:11:40.010 --> 00:11:43.940 line:100% position:50% align:middle
see how our lng and our lat have values?
If I change that to one and give it a

00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:48.950 line:100% position:50% align:middle
save, it will be able to update those
values for us no problem.

00:11:48.950 --> 00:11:53.760 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Other things we want to do here is add a
"required" attribute onto it,

00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:57.640 line:100% position:50% align:middle
just so you get some client side
validation, making sure that somebody puts

00:11:57.640 --> 00:12:01.460 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it in.but you'll notice that if we
actually delete "address" and give it a

00:12:01.460 --> 00:12:06.650 line:100% position:50% align:middle
save, we get an error that says, "You must
supply an address!" Well,

00:12:06.650 --> 00:12:13.370 line:100% position:50% align:middle
why is that happening? Well, our store
requires an address, which if you do not

00:12:13.370 --> 00:12:17.740 line:100% position:50% align:middle
give it a string with an address in it, it
says, "You must supply an address!" What's

00:12:17.740 --> 00:12:22.890 line:100% position:50% align:middle
happening here is that when we go to our
Store controller and we go to Create

00:12:22.890 --> 00:12:27.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Store, you notice that we're not handling
that error anywhere.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:33.730 line:100% position:50% align:middle
But what is happening, because we are
using async/await, and because we're using

00:12:33.730 --> 00:12:39.300 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that error handler, what happens is that
this, "await store.save",

00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:46.230 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that will fail, because our validation
does not pass. What will happen is that...

00:12:46.230 --> 00:12:51.450 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Let's look at our error handlers again.
Our handlers, we'll call them "next",

00:12:51.450 --> 00:12:58.610 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and what does "next" do? "Next" will go
into our App.js and we'll go to our

00:12:58.610 --> 00:13:02.690 line:100% position:50% align:middle
routes, here we go, and if it does not
work, it'll say, "All right.

00:13:02.690 --> 00:13:08.480 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Next." Then, it will go down the chain of
events. What actually happens is that we

00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:14.240 line:100% position:50% align:middle
have this flash validation error handler,
where now that we know all about flashes,

00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:18.480 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we can sort of help with them. We say, "If
there is no errors,

00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:22.170 line:100% position:50% align:middle
return next error." What that means is
that, [inaudible] put a comment

00:13:22.170 --> 00:13:29.950 line:100% position:50% align:middle
there, "If there are no errors to show for
flashes, skip it." What that will do is

00:13:29.950 --> 00:13:36.840 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it'll just pass on the error to the stack
trace. But if there is actually an error

00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:43.020 line:100% position:50% align:middle
message that we have, in our case, we're
going to check if the error has some

00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:48.970 line:100% position:50% align:middle
errors on it, then we're just going to
flash them. Because the model that we're

00:13:48.970 --> 00:13:53.850 line:100% position:50% align:middle
using here will actually pass us an error
message. If we have a good error message

00:13:53.850 --> 00:13:57.520 line:100% position:50% align:middle
from this, we don't need to show a stack
trace, because it didn't break.

00:13:57.520 --> 00:14:03.110 line:100% position:50% align:middle
It's just a validation error. The error
handler, for each of the possible errors,

00:14:03.110 --> 00:14:07.320 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it will flash that error and show it on
the page, and then it will call

00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:12.780 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"res.redirect(`back`)". That will just
redirect us to the page that we were on

00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:16.640 line:100% position:50% align:middle
previously, and it will not have actually
updated. So that's really nice.

00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:19.980 line:100% position:50% align:middle
You just have to have this once in your
application and you don't have to worry

00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:23.270 line:100% position:50% align:middle
about it, because the errors are still
going to filter through the different

00:14:23.270 --> 00:14:27.610 line:100% position:50% align:middle
levels that we have there. So I'm not
going to save anything there.

00:14:27.610 --> 00:14:33.250 line:100% position:50% align:middle
If we were to change this to "123 Fake
Street," give it a save,

00:14:33.250 --> 00:14:36.830 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it does work properly, and we get our
"Success" message here. Good.

00:14:36.830 --> 00:14:40.470 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Let's go back to our "storeForm" here.
Let's get rid of that dump.

00:14:40.470 --> 00:14:44.440 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now, let's actually hook up to Google Maps
so that when you type into here,

00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:48.280 line:100% position:50% align:middle
these lng and lat are actually going to
populate with real values,

00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:54.246 line:100% position:50% align:middle
rather than us having to work with the
existing ones that we have.

00:14:54.246 --> 00:14:57.246 line:100% position:50% align:middle
