00:00:11.245 --> 00:00:13.222 line:100% position:50% align:middle
All right, folks. Let's get set up with

00:00:13.222 --> 00:00:17.610 line:100% position:50% align:middle
everything that we need for this course.
First thing we need is Node.

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:21.010 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Wouldn't you have guessed that you
need Node for a Node JS course.

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:26.960 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Thing here is that you need to make sure
that you have Version 7.6 or above.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.090 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So, you might have Node already on your
computer. However, what we are using is

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:37.710 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the latest and the greatest, because
Node in Version 7.6 introduced something

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.540 line:100% position:50% align:middle
called async/await, which is going to make
our lives writing node code so much

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.800 line:100% position:50% align:middle
easier you're really going to enjoy it.
But you need to make sure that

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.900 line:100% position:50% align:middle
your environment supports it before we
can actually write any of this code.

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:53.610 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So what you can do is if you already have
Node installed, open up your terminal and

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.890 line:100% position:50% align:middle
go over to any folder. It doesn't matter
that if we're in the dang that's delicious

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:01.460 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we'll talk about in that in just a second.
You just type node-v and see which version

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:07.260 line:100% position:50% align:middle
of Node you have. If you see 7.6 or below,
then you'll need to go ahead and

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.580 line:100% position:50% align:middle
download the latest version from
nodejs.org or use any of your N or NVM or

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.100 line:100% position:50% align:middle
anything that you use to change your Node
version, if you're already comfortable

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.280 line:100% position:50% align:middle
with that. If you're not, click on this,
download it, hit the next,

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.490 line:100% position:50% align:middle
next, next buttons. You're also going to
get NPM, and that will come with a

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:27.490 line:100% position:50% align:middle
version, above 4 will be good enough.
Next thing that we need is to

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:32.350 line:100% position:50% align:middle
NPM install all of our dependencies.
So, in your dashboard,

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.810 line:100% position:50% align:middle
for your account, it's going to look
something like this. But it will say,

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.770 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"Learn Node" right here. You're going
to see a button that says,

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:42.620 line:100% position:50% align:middle
download starter files. You go ahead and
click that. That's going to link you off

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:47.560 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to the GitHub, which you can then click
and download all the files.

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:53.090 line:100% position:50% align:middle
In that, you're going to have a folder
called starter files. I recommend that you

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.950 line:100% position:50% align:middle
rename your starter files directory to
dang that's delicious, or whatever it is

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.290 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that you would like to work on it. The way
you can tell is if you type ls-l,

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:06.260 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you'll be able to see all of the different
files in there. And the one that we're

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:11.930 line:100% position:50% align:middle
actually looking for is the package.json.
So, you know you are in the right folder

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:16.410 line:100% position:50% align:middle
if you see a package.json. Then we simply
just need to go ahead and type npm

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:21.040 line:100% position:50% align:middle
install. What that's going to do is
it's going to go off and grab all of the

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.100 line:100% position:50% align:middle
dependencies, all of the frameworks
and all of the little helper files,

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:29.670 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and absolutely everything that we need in
order to run our Node application and

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:35.340 line:100% position:50% align:middle
interface with MongoDB and open it up
in the browser. All of that stuff is in

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.200 line:100% position:50% align:middle
our dependencies. And we're going to go
through each of those dependencies and

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.110 line:100% position:50% align:middle
explain why we picked them and what
they're used for. But at this point,

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:46.370 line:100% position:50% align:middle
what we're just doing is we're just going
off and grabbing an NPM,

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:51.570 line:100% position:50% align:middle
installing them. Next up, when that has
finished, we need to make sure that our

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:56.720 line:100% position:50% align:middle
code editor understands what Pug files
are. Pug is going to be the template

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.610 line:100% position:50% align:middle
engine that we're using to generate our
HTML. So, we're going to have a whole

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:03.570 line:100% position:50% align:middle
bunch of data, and we need to loop
over and display that data

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:07.850 line:100% position:50% align:middle
in HTML and how we do that is with
Pug. We've got all kinds of stuff coming

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:12.290 line:100% position:50% align:middle
up on it, but before we get into that, we
need to make sure that our code editor

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:16.440 line:100% position:50% align:middle
understands it. So, if you're using
Sublime Text, what you'll want to do is

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:22.820 line:100% position:50% align:middle
install the Jade package. And what that
will do is when you open up one of your

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:26.800 line:100% position:50% align:middle
things and you open up a random
Pug file, here I've got some,

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:30.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
base ones that you're going to be
starting with. If it is not syntax

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.520 line:100% position:50% align:middle
highlighted, what you need to do is go
into the bottom right-hand corner,

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:39.720 line:100% position:50% align:middle
click on open all with current
extension as. You want to find

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:46.610 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Jade in here and then click on Jade
and that will set anything with a .pug

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:51.300 line:100% position:50% align:middle
file on the end to open with a Jade
highlighter. If you are in Visual Studio

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:55.630 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Code, it comes default. You don't need to
install anything. If you are in Atom,

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:59.520 line:100% position:50% align:middle
there is one called language-jade,
which will get you set up

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:04.170 line:100% position:50% align:middle
for highlighting in that one. I'm sure
every other editor has support for that as

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:08.290 line:100% position:50% align:middle
well. So, make sure that you can open up
your Sublime Text. Also,

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:11.580 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I'm going to be opening up some JavaScript
files, and we're going to be using some

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:16.130 line:100% position:50% align:middle
advanced new features to JavaScript called
async/await. And in order to get the best

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:21.610 line:100% position:50% align:middle
syntax highlighting for that, we want to
have a syntax highlighter in Sublime

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:25.247 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Text called JavaScript Babel. And you
can...you've probably done this in my

00:04:25.247 --> 00:04:29.130 line:100% position:50% align:middle
other tutorials. But again, if you don't
have it, make sure you go grab that from

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:33.770 line:100% position:50% align:middle
package control. The ones in Visual Studio
Code and Atom are already up to date,

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:39.030 line:100% position:50% align:middle
so there's no need to install any new
ones. Finally before you email me,

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:41.730 line:100% position:50% align:middle
asking what terminal do you use, what
color scheme do you use,

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:47.560 line:100% position:50% align:middle
what font do you use, what kind of toilet
paper do you use, go to wesbos.com/uses

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:52.610 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and I detail absolutely everything
down. It's probably stuff you don't

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:56.290 line:100% position:50% align:middle
care about, but if you do, it's listed
here. And it has all of the themes

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:59.590 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that I use for terminal, all the programs
that I use, all the fonts that I use,

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:04.200 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and everything else. If there
isn't something covered in here,

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:07.850 line:100% position:50% align:middle
shoot me an email and I will add it
to the list. Other than that,

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:12.180 line:100% position:50% align:middle
our environment is now set up. We're going
to move onto next, which is MongoDB.

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:15.213 line:100% position:50% align:middle
