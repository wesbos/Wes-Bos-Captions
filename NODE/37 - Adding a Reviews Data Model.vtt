Next up, we need to work on reviews.
Reviews are going to be actually powering

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:18.970 line:100% position:50% align:middle
quite a bit of our website. First of all,
when you're viewing a storeCard,

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:23.490 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it will tell you how many reviews that
actual place has. You can click through to

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.320 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it, and you can see that there is a number
of reviews for each of the stores,

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.330 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the different people who have left those
reviews. You can also see when they have

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:38.090 line:100% position:50% align:middle
left the review. Then, finally, when you
are logged in, you can leave a review

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:41.690 line:100% position:50% align:middle
yourself, as well as leave a number of
stars. So that's what we're going to be

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:44.640 line:100% position:50% align:middle
going for here. It's also going to be
powering our top layout,

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.800 line:100% position:50% align:middle
which will give us the average rating of
reviews, and we're going to rank them

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:54.890 line:100% position:50% align:middle
based on that. So let's go over to our
models here. If you're feeling fairly

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:58.280 line:100% position:50% align:middle
comfortable with this sort of thing, maybe
we can take a pause and try to do this

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:03.300 line:100% position:50% align:middle
yourself. Otherwise, gear up for the ride,
because here we go.

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.140 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We're going into our models here, and
we're going to make a new one called

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.870 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"Review.js". We're going to do the same
thing we've been doing before.

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:15.110 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We're going to import Mongoose. We're
going to set the promise to "global".

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.720 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Then, we'll make our schema. Then, we will
export the model itself.

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.360 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Good. So we're all set up with our model
here. The last thing we want to do is go

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.740 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to our start.js and import our model here,
and we're ready to go.

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.880 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So what are the different fields that we
need on our Review Schema?

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.450 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Well, we need the following. We need to
create a date. We need an author.

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:40.870 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We need a store for which that review was
being sent for. We need the text of the

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:46.370 line:100% position:50% align:middle
review. We need a rating of the review,
and that's all that we actually need.

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:51.510 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So created is going to be a date. So let's
open that one right up.

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:57.970 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We'll say type is a "Date", and the
default is going to be "Date.now".

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:02.040 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Then, the author is going to be a type
of... Well, this one can be a

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.370 line:100% position:50% align:middle
relationship, because you need one of your
existing users to be the author.

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:12.910 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So it's going to be "mongoose. Schema.
ObjectID". The ref is going to be our user

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:17.320 line:100% position:50% align:middle
model. Right? Because it's going to
reference another document in our

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:21.580 line:100% position:50% align:middle
database. Then, "required" is going to say
something like, "You must supply an

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:27.430 line:100% position:50% align:middle
author!" Now, our store is going to be
very similar to that. We are going to have

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:33.660 line:100% position:50% align:middle
a type of the object ID. The reference is
going to be our store model,

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:40.480 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and the required is, "You must supply a
store!" The text is simply going to be a

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:45.770 line:100% position:50% align:middle
string and it required, "Your review must
have text!" Then, finally,

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:50.570 line:100% position:50% align:middle
our rating is going to be a type of
"Number" and it's going to have a min of

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:55.920 line:100% position:50% align:middle
one and a max of five. So that will give
us the values that we need there.

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.530 line:100% position:50% align:middle
If someone tries to submit something on
either end of that, it will error out for

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:06.250 line:100% position:50% align:middle
us. Now, what we need to do is to create
the interface for actually submitting a

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.060 line:100% position:50% align:middle
review. So we're going to be doing that on
one of our single store pages.

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:15.010 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So that would be on our Store.pug. That
would be down here. Now,

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:18.590 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I don't want to do just the review code
right inside of here. We're going to do

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:24.320 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that inside of a mixin. So we'll open up
our sidebar here. We'll go into our views,

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:29.300 line:100% position:50% align:middle
go into our mixins
folder, and we'll make an

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:33.250 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"_reviewForm.pug", and we'll make our
mixin called "reviewForm".

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:38.740 line:100% position:50% align:middle
That takes in a store, and from that we
are going to return a form tag,

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:43.910 line:100% position:50% align:middle
which has an action of, we'll need some
backticks here, "/reviews/".

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:50.600 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We'll put the store ID in the action URL
route no problem. So "store_id".

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:57.440 line:100% position:50% align:middle
The method will be "POST", and we'll give
it a class of "reviewer".

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:04.580 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Inside of that, we need a text area with
the name of "text", because that's going

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:08.600 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to line up with the field that we have
here. Then, we need a placeholder,

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:11.930 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and that will be set to, "Did you try this
place? Have something to say?

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:17.110 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Leave a review..." Then, we need the
review meta. Well, actually,

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:22.090 line:100% position:50% align:middle
let's just get that going for a sec, so we
can actually see what that will look like.

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:26.860 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we'll go back into our Store.pug. We'll
go above our "block content" and we'll

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:34.540 line:100% position:50% align:middle
include our actual mixin. So
"mixins/_reviewForm". Then, down here we

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:39.020 line:100% position:50% align:middle
can say we want to make sure that they are
logged in. So "if user",

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:43.410 line:100% position:50% align:middle
then if that is true, we'll just use our
"reviewForm" and we'll pass it the store.

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:46.310 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Right? Because we have the "store"
variable, it's already available to us,

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:50.490 line:100% position:50% align:middle
if we pass it to the store, it should be
able to accept that data.

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:55.240 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now, if I refresh this page layout now,
oh, no. We get an error.

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:59.620 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Let's see what we did here. It's telling
us that there is no re-...

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:04.360 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"Oh, you have to learn how to spell before
you do this stuff. "reviewForm",

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:07.520 line:100% position:50% align:middle
there we go. Let's see now. Now, I'm not
seeing anything, because I'm not logged

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:11.160 line:100% position:50% align:middle
in. So I'll log in real quick and now I'm
seeing the, "Did you try this place?

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:14.470 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Have something to say? Leave a review..."
So that's our text area.

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:18.620 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Then, we can go back to our review form
here and just [continue] on with what we

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:22.470 line:100% position:50% align:middle
have. Now, the HTML layout of this is
pretty important, because what I want to

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:26.580 line:100% position:50% align:middle
have is this actual Stars layout, where
you hover over the stars and it will

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:31.530 line:100% position:50% align:middle
correspond with an actual radio button
input. So as a sibling to text area,

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:39.160 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we'll have a "reviewer__meta". Inside of
that, we'll have a "reviewer__stars".

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:42.710 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Inside of that, we are going to do a loop
for one, two, three,

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:46.890 line:100% position:50% align:middle
four, five, because we need five inputs
here that are going to be checkboxes.

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:50.140 line:100% position:50% align:middle
However, I am going to do it backwards,
and I'll explain this in just a second.

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:54.110 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So I'll say, "each num in", and we'll just
make an array here,

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:59.850 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"5, 4, 3, 2, 1". Then, for each of those,
we need an input with the type of "radio"

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:04.830 line:100% position:50% align:middle
button. We want a required attribute. The
idea of it is going to be,

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:10.590 line:100% position:50% align:middle
backticks, "stars" and we'll put the "num"
in there. So stars 1,

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:15.210 line:100% position:50% align:middle
stars 2, stars 3, etc. , etc. The name of
this is going to be "rating",

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:19.600 line:100% position:50% align:middle
because this is going to be sent over to
our model, and that's what "rating" is

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:26.100 line:100% position:50% align:middle
right here. The value of it is going to be
the "num". So if I give that a refresh

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:30.260 line:100% position:50% align:middle
now, you're not going to see anything. If
I inspect it, you will see that it's

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:34.210 line:100% position:50% align:middle
there. But I'm actually hiding it with
CSS. So crack that open.

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:39.220 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Crack that open. You'll see here, "5, 4,
3, 2, 1", they are being displayed "none",

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:42.830 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and that's because I don't actually want
the inputs themselves to show up.

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:47.480 line:100% position:50% align:middle
But we are going to be using the labels to
show stars in place of these.

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:53.190 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we'll give it a label here, and it's
going to have a "for" attribute of

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:58.760 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"`stars${num}`". The reason why I do that
is because if you want to be able to click

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:03.320 line:100% position:50% align:middle
a label and select the input that's
associated with it, then you must make

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:07.270 line:100% position:50% align:middle
sure that your "for" and your "id" are the
exact same thing. Then,

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:14.840 line:100% position:50% align:middle
inside of that, we can use our "#{num}
stars" just as a label that we have there.

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:19.880 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So if I give that a refresh now, you'll
see that I've got this nifty little Stars

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:25.760 line:100% position:50% align:middle
layout, that when I hover over top of it,
I'm able to click on it and select the

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:29.970 line:100% position:50% align:middle
number of stars. It is backwards now.
However, that is going to all make sense

00:07:29.970 --> 00:07:33.670 line:100% position:50% align:middle
in just a second. Let's go back to a
sibling of ".reviewer__stars" and give

00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:37.120 line:100% position:50% align:middle
ourselves an input with a class of
"button", and that's going to be a type of

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:43.580 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"submit", and a value equals "Submit
Review". So now, when I give that a

00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:47.910 line:100% position:50% align:middle
refresh, you see that these are side by
side. Now, when I hover over it,

00:07:47.910 --> 00:07:51.050 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you see that we actually highlight our
stars. It is still backwards,

00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:56.530 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and that is because this should be "star"
singular, not "stars".

00:07:56.530 --> 00:08:04.710 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Refresh that. If you look at
"reviewer.scss", what we're doing is we're

00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:11.980 line:100% position:50% align:middle
doing Flexbox to reorder them. So 5 is
Order 5, 4 is 4, 3 is 3,

00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:16.170 line:100% position:50% align:middle
2 is 2, 1 is 1. The reason why we're doing
that is because when something is

00:08:16.170 --> 00:08:24.970 line:100% position:50% align:middle
selected, or when something is hovered,
the labels that are in the future of them

00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:29.530 line:100% position:50% align:middle
will be turned into yellow. So that's a
little CSS hack that you can use,

00:08:29.530 --> 00:08:34.220 line:100% position:50% align:middle
is if you do them in the opposite way, and
then reorder them either with floats or

00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:38.730 line:100% position:50% align:middle
with Flexbox, you can do this little trick
where you can have this highlighted,

00:08:38.730 --> 00:08:43.080 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and you can just select all the stores
that are in the future.

00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:46.980 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So you can see here, if I highlight over
the last one, it's one.

00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:51.790 line:100% position:50% align:middle
But really, the last one is the first one,
because I have reordered them in my CSS.

00:08:51.790 --> 00:08:55.320 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So a little bit confusing there. But if
you want to dive a little bit more into

00:08:55.320 --> 00:09:00.160 line:100% position:50% align:middle
CSS and see that little trick that we did,
the big thing here is that these are now

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:05.650 line:100% position:50% align:middle
just selecting the associated radio input
for us. That means when we submit this

00:09:05.650 --> 00:09:10.110 line:100% position:50% align:middle
form, we're going to get the value of the
actual input here. So we have this thing,

00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:15.340 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and if I were to say, "Pretty good," and
submit that review, we get a 404,

00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:21.050 line:100% position:50% align:middle
because we do not have a route handler for
"reviews/" the ID. So let's do that now.

00:09:21.050 --> 00:09:30.990 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Open up our index.js. Go down to the
bottom here, right above our API and we'll

00:09:30.990 --> 00:09:36.820 line:100% position:50% align:middle
say, "router.post(`/reviews/:id`, )". When
that happens, we are going to first make

00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:40.440 line:100% position:50% align:middle
sure that they are logged in. So we'll
say, "authController.isLoggedIn",

00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:44.340 line:100% position:50% align:middle
because we want to make sure that they're
actually a user before they post data

00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:49.320 line:100% position:50% align:middle
here. Then, second, we want to catch
errors, and we're going to use a new

00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:54.170 line:100% position:50% align:middle
controller that we're going to make called
"reviewController" and the method is going

00:09:54.170 --> 00:09:57.520 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to be called "addReview". Good. So we make
sure they're logged in,

00:09:57.520 --> 00:10:01.580 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and of course we can write this on its own
line if this is getting a little bit hairy

00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:06.270 line:100% position:50% align:middle
for you to read. Then, we have
"catchErrors" on the next line and put

00:10:06.270 --> 00:10:09.830 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that there. Good. Now, you can see my
editor is yelling at me,

00:10:09.830 --> 00:10:14.850 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"Review Controller is not to find." Let's
go to the top, and let's import our Review

00:10:14.850 --> 00:10:19.020 line:100% position:50% align:middle
controller. So we can just duplicate the
auth. Select your word "auth" and replace

00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:26.170 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it with "review". Then, let's make that
controller and grab in Mongoose,

00:10:26.170 --> 00:10:30.050 line:100% position:50% align:middle
reference our review model, and then start
to add that handler,

00:10:30.050 --> 00:10:37.940 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"exports.addReview =". It's an async. We
have a request and we have a response,

00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:42.500 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and from that we need a couple things. So
first of all, we're going to get this big

00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:46.710 line:100% position:50% align:middle
payload where we have a couple of
different fields that are coming in.

00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:51.070 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We have our text field and we have our
review field that are coming in.

00:10:51.070 --> 00:10:58.170 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So let's just try to immediately
"res.json" the "req.body" just to see what

00:10:58.170 --> 00:11:00.910 line:100% position:50% align:middle
sort of data we're getting in. So I am
going to have three stars,

00:11:00.910 --> 00:11:05.200 line:100% position:50% align:middle
say "P good", submit that review. It
broke. Let me see what's going on here.

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:13.170 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I've got a crash, "required", require
"Mongoose". If I go back to my Olive Oil

00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:18.430 line:100% position:50% align:middle
store, I'll say it's "P good", give me
three stars, submit that review.

00:11:18.430 --> 00:11:22.620 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Then, you can see, if we're sending back
the data that we're getting in the body,

00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:26.110 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we have a text and a rating. Those two
other pieces of data that we need before

00:11:26.110 --> 00:11:29.250 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that is the author and the store. So what
we'll do is we'll say,

00:11:29.250 --> 00:11:39.870 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"req.body.author =" "req.user. _id". So
far, so good. Let's refresh this,

00:11:39.870 --> 00:11:42.940 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and you see that the author ID is coming
along, because I'm signed in.

00:11:42.940 --> 00:11:50.760 line:100% position:50% align:middle
That's my ID. Then, I'm going to duplicate
that and say the "req.body.store = req.".

00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:56.440 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now, where is the store ID? It's in the
URL here. Right? "Req.params.id",

00:11:56.440 --> 00:12:02.520 line:100% position:50% align:middle
so that's the ID that's coming in from the
URL, and this is the ID that's coming in

00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:07.770 line:100% position:50% align:middle
from the currently logged in user. Give
that a save, and if I resubmit that form,

00:12:07.770 --> 00:12:10.350 line:100% position:50% align:middle
then I'll see that I'm getting a text, the
rating, the author,

00:12:10.350 --> 00:12:15.610 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and the store values coming in no problem.
Good. So we can get rid of that "res.json"

00:12:15.610 --> 00:12:18.410 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and we can start to save our new review.
So let's make a variable,

00:12:18.410 --> 00:12:23.550 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"newReview", and that's equal to a "new
Review" model. We simply just need to pass

00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:27.830 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it the "req.body", because that is going
to have the text, the rating,

00:12:27.830 --> 00:12:34.220 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the author, and the store on it. Then, we
can await the "newReview.save".

00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:39.660 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Once that has saved, we will redirect them
back to the page where they came from.

00:12:39.660 --> 00:12:42.490 line:100% position:50% align:middle
At this point, we can also tell them that
their review was successfully saved.

00:12:42.490 --> 00:12:50.730 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we can say, "req.flash(`success`,
`Review Saved!`)". Good. So when somebody

00:12:50.730 --> 00:12:54.870 line:100% position:50% align:middle
posts this URL, we're going to save the
author and the store. We're going to take

00:12:54.870 --> 00:12:59.290 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the existing text and rating that they've
passed us, and then we are going to save

00:12:59.290 --> 00:13:03.240 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it into our review, and then redirect them
back to the page. So let's go back to our

00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:07.740 line:100% position:50% align:middle
homepage here. Let's go to one of our
stores here. I'm going to go to Randy's

00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:13.770 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Joint and I'm going to say, "This place
rocks!", give that a five-star review,

00:13:13.770 --> 00:13:18.470 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and then submit it. It says, "Review
saved!" and redirects us right back to

00:13:18.470 --> 00:13:23.650 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Randy's Joint. Now, it's not showing up,
but if we open our MongoDB Compass here

00:13:23.650 --> 00:13:28.890 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and we go back to our schema, and apply,
it should be showing up in the sidebar

00:13:28.890 --> 00:13:35.140 line:100% position:50% align:middle
here. I am not seeing it. But if we give
it a refresh, I just did a CMD+R and let

00:13:35.140 --> 00:13:39.140 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it reconnect, there we go. Our reviews are
now popping up. There is one review.

00:13:39.140 --> 00:13:42.750 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I can open that up. I can look at my
documents here and say, "This place

00:13:42.750 --> 00:13:48.640 line:100% position:50% align:middle
rocks!" The rating is five. The author is
an object ID, and the store is also an

00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:55.500 line:100% position:50% align:middle
object ID. So both of those pieces of data
are associated with the actual store.

00:13:55.500 --> 00:14:00.310 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now comes the question of how do we
actually pull in a list of reviews for

00:14:00.310 --> 00:14:03.584 line:100% position:50% align:middle
this specific store. That's what we'll be
doing in the next video.

00:14:03.584 --> 00:14:06.584 line:100% position:50% align:middle
