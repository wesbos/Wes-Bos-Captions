- [Wes Bos] By now you are probably sick

00:00:14.065 --> 00:00:18.110 line:100% position:50% align:middle
of making stores and having to fill out
these forms of just random stuff.

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:21.940 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And we're about to work on our API here
where we're going to be able to search for

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:25.590 line:100% position:50% align:middle
stores, but in order for us to search for
stuff, we need a whole bunch of data to

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.790 line:100% position:50% align:middle
actually search for. So, what I've done
here, if we open up our package.json

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:36.340 line:100% position:50% align:middle
file, you'll know that there are a number
of different scripts in here, and this

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:39.933 line:100% position:50% align:middle
might look a little bit different from
what you have, depending on what all of

00:00:39.933 --> 00:00:43.509 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the deployment stuff ends up being, but we
do have ones called 'Sample' and

00:00:43.509 --> 00:00:50.540 line:100% position:50% align:middle
'blowitallaway.' And what Sample will do
is run a script called load-sample-data.js

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:53.800 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and blowitallaway will also do that, but
it'll just delete everything.

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:58.732 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Let's open up that file and look at what
we got here. So, look at load-sample-data,

00:00:58.732 --> 00:01:04.800 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and this is sort of a quick and dirty
script. It's not part of our application,

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.170 line:100% position:50% align:middle
which is why we need to do all of the
requiring, the environmental

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:13.674 line:100% position:50% align:middle
variables and requiring the connection to
the database and what not.

00:01:13.674 --> 00:01:17.830 line:100% position:50% align:middle
That's why it's outside of our
application, but what this will do is it

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:21.920 line:100% position:50% align:middle
will load everything up, connect to our
database, bring in our models,

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:27.890 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and then read the files from stores.json
to reviews.json and users.json.

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.086 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So, if I open up stores.json,
you'll see that this is just

00:01:31.086 --> 00:01:36.640 line:100% position:50% align:middle
a whole bunch of data related to some
sample stores, and the same we'll be able

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:43.950 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to use in users. That will load them into
some objects here. And then the function

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.629 line:100% position:50% align:middle
called loadData is going to
insertMany(stores); inserMany(reviews);

00:01:48.629 --> 00:01:50.224 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and insertMany(users);

00:01:50.224 --> 00:01:53.890 line:100% position:50% align:middle
from which we console.log 'Done!', and
we're done out of the thing.

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:59.590 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So, that's what we've got so far, but we
don't have reviews yet.

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:01.463 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So, this isn't going to work

00:02:01.463 --> 00:02:04.790 line:100% position:50% align:middle
just yet. So what I want you to do is to
comment out a couple of things so we can

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:08.055 line:100% position:50% align:middle
actually run this and stop having to
input data manually.

00:02:08.055 --> 00:02:19.082 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So go to our review here. Comment that one
out, One. That one, Two. Three. Four.

00:02:19.082 --> 00:02:20.930 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And that's it. Four.

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:25.340 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So how do we run this script? Well, we
should be able to go back to our terminal

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:30.470 line:100% position:50% align:middle
here. I'm going to kill what I'm running
right now with control c, and

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.840 line:100% position:50% align:middle
then I'm going to run 'npm run sample.'

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.220 line:100% position:50% align:middle
There we go! It worked. It loaded in.
Don't worry about this deprecation error

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.310 line:100% position:50% align:middle
message. That's not something we ever have
to worry about. And then we have this

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:47.850 line:100% position:50% align:middle
thumbs up, done! And if you go back to
your Mongo DB compass and click on stores

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:54.880 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and apply this, you'll see we now have
eighteen documents, and they are spread

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:59.456 line:100% position:50% align:middle
out all over the world, and if you look at
your documents here, you are going to see

00:02:59.456 --> 00:03:02.080 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that we've got all kinds of great stuff.

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.730 line:100% position:50% align:middle
You should be able to refresh our
application. Oh, it doesn't work.

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:10.010 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Why? Because we have to start our app
again. 'npm start' or bom start.

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:18.430 line:100% position:50% align:middle
'npm start'. And then refresh this
sucker, and ...lots and lots of lots of

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:22.800 line:100% position:50% align:middle
data. Obviously we are going to need
to do the pagination bit pretty soon.

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:27.642 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We've got quite a bit going on here, and
if you click on one of them, you should

00:03:27.642 --> 00:03:30.855 line:100% position:50% align:middle
see all the information. We can actually
remove that real quick.

00:03:30.855 --> 00:03:40.060 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Let's open up store.pug.
Take that dump out of there.

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:44.090 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Good. So we've got all of our data. Go to
tags and you can see a whole bunch of

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:47.510 line:100% position:50% align:middle
different tags that are being pulled in -
"Family friendly," "Vegetarian,"

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:48.880 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"Licensed." Good.

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:52.710 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So, that was how we load a bunch of data.
If you ever want to delete all of the data

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:59.231 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you can run it. Just look at the readme.md
and you can run 'npm run blowitallaway'

00:03:59.231 --> 00:04:04.483 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and that will delete all of your data. As
part of importing all of these users, I

00:04:04.483 --> 00:04:10.181 line:100% position:50% align:middle
imported three extra users here: Wes,
Debbie, and Beau. And if you look at our

00:04:10.181 --> 00:04:14.424 line:100% position:50% align:middle
data here. Go to 'users,' you're going to
see that there's a Randy, there's a

00:04:14.424 --> 00:04:18.980 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Wesley, those are the two that we made,
but now here's Beau, Debbie, and Wes,

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:22.900 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and their all at example.com. So if you
ever need to log in and log out as other

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:27.530 line:100% position:50% align:middle
people, their email addresses are in the
readme.md, and their passwords are, also.

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:30.200 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So it's Wes, Debbie, and Beau. Those are
all the passwords for you

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:34.410 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to log in as those people. So we can try
it real quick. Try logging in as Debbie

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:42.195 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Downer. There we go. Now I'm
logged in as Debbie Downer.

00:04:42.195 --> 00:04:44.290 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So that's how you load a
bunch of sample data.

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:49.295 line:100% position:50% align:middle
These images work, because in the public
uploads folder when you cloned this repo

00:04:49.295 --> 00:04:53.340 line:100% position:50% align:middle
or downloaded it from Github you'll notice
that it came with a bunch of images

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:57.730 line:100% position:50% align:middle
already, and you can use those. Those are
there, because they are associated with

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:00.867 line:100% position:50% align:middle
some of the stores that we have uploaded.
So that's our sample data.

00:05:00.867 --> 00:05:05.849 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now that we have it, let's move into
getting the search up and running.
