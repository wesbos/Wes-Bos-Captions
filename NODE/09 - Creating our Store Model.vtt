Let's do a little bit of clean up. We're
going to get rid of this

00:00:14.317 --> 00:00:17.260 line:100% position:50% align:middle
myMiddleware here, not
necessary for us to need it

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:21.370 line:100% position:50% align:middle
anymore. And then we'll open up our
index.js which has our routes file and

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:23.940 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we'll take out that middleware. We're
going to be using a lot more middleware in

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:28.260 line:100% position:50% align:middle
this course. But for now, our main route,
we'll only get our storeController

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.730 line:100% position:50% align:middle
homepage. Now, let's talk about models.
Models are where our data is going to be

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:38.100 line:100% position:50% align:middle
stored. And before we can actually create
a piece of data, we're going to be able to

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.050 line:100% position:50% align:middle
create stores. Before we can create a
piece of data, we need to sort of describe

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.160 line:100% position:50% align:middle
what that data will look like ahead of
time. The simplest way that I can put it

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.630 line:100% position:50% align:middle
is if you were making a spreadsheet, what
would you do ahead of time is you would

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:56.950 line:100% position:50% align:middle
start to create all of the column headings
for the different data that you expect to

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:00.490 line:100% position:50% align:middle
have. Now, a model can go a little bit
further in terms of telling what type of

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:04.960 line:100% position:50% align:middle
data it expects whether it's a string or
an array. It can do a little bit of clean

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.580 line:100% position:50% align:middle
up before the data is saved. It can do
things like creating a slug.

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.100 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We're going to be looking into all of
that. And that's how we do it.

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.450 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now, before we get into this, I just want
to say MongoDB can be what's called a

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.860 line:100% position:50% align:middle
loose database. Meaning that you do not
need to specify what your data will look

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.800 line:100% position:50% align:middle
like ahead of time. Sort of, like, if you
have a JavaScript object,

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:28.510 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and you don't need to specify what the
properties on that object are.

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:32.550 line:100% position:50% align:middle
You just go ahead and start using them.
However, by default, out of the box,

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:38.940 line:100% position:50% align:middle
MongoDB is strict in terms of it will only
allow you to save data that it knows about

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:42.130 line:100% position:50% align:middle
beforehand, and that's the way that I like
to keep it. Because if you sort of just

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.050 line:100% position:50% align:middle
start going willy-nilly, adding data
wherever it is that you would like,

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:49.320 line:100% position:50% align:middle
sort of, like, if you had an object and
you started going willy-nilly,

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.220 line:100% position:50% align:middle
adding data to your object, it can get out
of hand really quickly and it leads to

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:57.560 line:100% position:50% align:middle
some headaches down the road once you
start trying to scale your application.

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.280 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we're going to be doing everything in
strict mode. Which means that you need to

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.910 line:100% position:50% align:middle
define your schema beforehand.

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:09.250 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So let's go ahead and go to our model's
folder and we are going to create a new

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:16.110 line:100% position:50% align:middle
model called Store.js, capital S on that.
And in that model, we're going to need a

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:21.590 line:100% position:50% align:middle
couple things. First, we're going to need
a package called "mongoose." So MongoDB is

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:26.500 line:100% position:50% align:middle
our database and mongoose is the package
that we use to interface.

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.750 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Because MongoDB can be used with any
language, whether you're doing Python or

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:37.870 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Ruby or PHP. And one of the popular ways
to interface with MongoDB in node is with

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:44.950 line:100% position:50% align:middle
a mongoose package. Const mongoose=,
require the mongoose package.

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:51.430 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Next, we also need to tell mongoose that
the Promise to use is the global.

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:55.470 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Promise. And what does that mean there?
When we get into queering our database,

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.410 line:100% position:50% align:middle
there's a couple of ways that we can wait
for our data to come back from the

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:04.370 line:100% position:50% align:middle
database because it happens synchronously.
You can use the built-in callbacks.

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:08.410 line:100% position:50% align:middle
You can use a external library, Promise
library like Bluebird.

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:11.670 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Or what we're going to be doing, because
we're going to be learning about something

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:15.650 line:100% position:50% align:middle
called async/await is that we are using
the built-in ES6 Promise.

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:20.570 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we essentially set the mongoose Promise
property to be global which is sort of,

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:24.960 line:100% position:50% align:middle
like, the Window in the browser. That's
our global variable. And the access is the

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:30.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
capital P, Promise. So that's like if you
were to open up your DevTools here and

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.240 line:100% position:50% align:middle
type in "Promise", you'll see that you get
the native Promise.

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:35.010 line:100% position:50% align:middle
That's exactly what we're doing here.

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:40.160 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now that global, don't ever put stuff on
it. It's tempting just to put everything

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:44.340 line:100% position:50% align:middle
on the global as you have on the Window,
but it's generally not what you want.

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.870 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Finally, we need a library called slugs.
So const slug=require('slugs'),

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:52.730 line:100% position:50% align:middle
make sure you have a S on there. What
that's going to do is it's going to allow

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:57.820 line:100% position:50% align:middle
us to make URL friendly names for our
slugs, sort of, like, if you've ever used

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:01.920 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the word "press permalink". Now we need to
go ahead and make our schema.

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:11.370 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we will make it, storeSchema=new
mongoose. Schema. Pass that an object.

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:15.300 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And then before we even specify any of the
properties on our schema,

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:19.660 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we'll go ahead and export that sucker. Now
previously, we did export.

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:25.860 line:100% position:50% align:middle
whatever it is that we wanted, is equal
to a function. Now if you are...if the

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:31.120 line:100% position:50% align:middle
main thing that you're exporting from a
file is going to be importable,

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:37.760 line:100% position:50% align:middle
then you can put it on module.exports=. So
you see here, we just say,

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:40.910 line:100% position:50% align:middle
here, we do module exports because it's
the main thing that we're exporting.

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:44.600 line:100% position:50% align:middle
But if we open up our storeController, you
notice that we're just exporting

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:49.560 line:100% position:50% align:middle
properties on the export variable. And the
difference between that is not a huge

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:56.840 line:100% position:50% align:middle
thing. But it all boils down to when you
import a package, is the main thing that

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:02.490 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you import from it going to be a function
or are you just importing an object that

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:06.280 line:100% position:50% align:middle
has many properties on it, or they can
also be both. So we'll go more into that.

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:09.220 line:100% position:50% align:middle
You'll see more examples. So that's why
it's module.exports.

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:15.510 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And we'll say mongoose.model, and we're
going to name that model capital S,

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:20.290 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Store, and we're going to give our schema
which, again, will describe what our data

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:24.480 line:100% position:50% align:middle
looks like. Good, now we can go ahead and
start putting all of our properties.

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:26.930 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So the first thing that we're going to
have, we're going to have a name,

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:32.370 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we're going to have a slug, we are going
to have a description,

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:36.690 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and we are going to have tags. The name is
going to be a String.

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:40.940 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we could just type string here, and
that will know that when it saves it to

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:45.720 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the database, it will be saved as a
string. But there's a couple other things

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:49.110 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that we need to pass along here. So rather
than just passing string,

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:53.350 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you can also pass it an object which has
all of our properties on it.

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:58.700 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So the type is going to be a String. And
we can also specific different properties

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:03.170 line:100% position:50% align:middle
like trim, and that's going to be set to
true. So if somebody tries to pass in a

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:09.020 line:100% position:50% align:middle
name or has, like, a Store Name here, what
it will automatically do before it saves

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:11.950 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it is it's going to take out the white
space on either end.

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:19.900 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So my general rule of thumb is do all of
your data normalization as close to the

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:25.100 line:100% position:50% align:middle
model as possible. So if the model has a
property built-in that will trim it,

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:29.800 line:100% position:50% align:middle
do it on the model rather than having to
do it right before you save it and do any

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:33.740 line:100% position:50% align:middle
validation. So we'll say trim is true. And
it's also required...so we can say

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:39.140 line:100% position:50% align:middle
required, true. However, if you try to
save a Store without a name,

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:43.820 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it's going to give us some, like, ugly
MongoDB error message which isn't very

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:47.960 line:100% position:50% align:middle
user-friendly. So rather than passing it
true [inaudible] we can pass it an error

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:53.330 line:100% position:50% align:middle
message which will act as true as well as
give us the error if someone doesn't pass

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:58.260 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it. So let's say, "Please enter a store
name." Good, so that's it.

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:04.190 line:100% position:50% align:middle
The slug, what will the slug be? Slug will
just be a String, so not necessary to do

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:10.210 line:100% position:50% align:middle
an object here because it's just a String.
The description is going to be a String as

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:16.410 line:100% position:50% align:middle
well. So we'll say type, we'll say String,
and we'll also trim it to be true.

00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:23.580 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And our tags is going to be an array of
Strings. So what we do there is we

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:27.870 line:100% position:50% align:middle
pass it an array here and we say it
will be an array of Strings,

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:31.540 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and that means we'll pass multiple Strings
sometimes, because there's going to be

00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:36.980 line:100% position:50% align:middle
multiple tags, and each one of them will
be put inside an array like that.

00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:42.490 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we give that a save. And we need to
know kick-start this model and make

00:07:42.490 --> 00:07:45.867 line:100% position:50% align:middle
MongoDB known about it. Oh, I got a red
error here, make sure

00:07:45.867 --> 00:07:48.280 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you put a comma right there.

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:52.730 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So how do we make MongoDB know about this
actual model? Because we've created the

00:07:52.730 --> 00:07:56.030 line:100% position:50% align:middle
model here, however we haven't import it
into our application anywhere.

00:07:56.030 --> 00:07:59.480 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Well, we're go into our Store.js. We'll go
right where it says,

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:03.990 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"Ready, let's go." and we are going to
import all of our models.

00:08:03.990 --> 00:08:09.690 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So let's say import all our models. And
importing our models, you only have to do

00:08:09.690 --> 00:08:15.240 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it once because as soon as you connect to
MongoDB and as soon as you import your

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:19.070 line:100% position:50% align:middle
models, MongoDB will know about them
throughout your entire application.

00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:23.640 line:100% position:50% align:middle
It's using a concept in node called a
singleton which means that once you

00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:27.050 line:100% position:50% align:middle
configure it, you don't have to keep doing
it in every single file because that would

00:08:27.050 --> 00:08:31.140 line:100% position:50% align:middle
be a bit of a pain to have to import our
models and connect to the database on the

00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:37.240 line:100% position:50% align:middle
top of every single file. So we're simply
just going to require our models folder,

00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:41.260 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and this one's called Store.js. Again, you
don't need to put the .js on the end,

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:44.273 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it is assumed. So we'll come back to that,
import the rest of our

00:08:44.273 --> 00:08:46.910 line:100% position:50% align:middle
models as we have it running.

00:08:46.910 --> 00:08:49.900 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Just to make sure that everything is
running fine, let's go back to our local

00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:55.960 line:100% position:50% align:middle
host and refresh. I got an error here,
let's open it up. String is not defined.

00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:58.550 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Let's go back to our Store here. You're
probably yelling at me,

00:08:58.550 --> 00:09:03.750 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"Oh, silly Wes." Capital S, String. There
we go. Refresh the page,

00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:08.880 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and you should see your "hi" pop up on the
page. That's how you know nothing has gone

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:12.260 line:100% position:50% align:middle
wrong while we created this. But take a
look at our data here,

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:15.990 line:100% position:50% align:middle
name, slug, description, and tags, we're
going to be supplying with the name,

00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:20.300 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the description, and the tags. However,
the slug is gonna be auto generated

00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:25.870 line:100% position:50% align:middle
whenever somebody saves. What we use for
that is a pre-save hook in MongoDB.

00:09:25.870 --> 00:09:32.040 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Meaning that before somebody saves a
Store, we are going to auto generate the

00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:37.360 line:100% position:50% align:middle
slug field so that they can be passed in.
So the way we do that is we take our

00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:44.120 line:100% position:50% align:middle
storage schema and we pre-save. So before
it is saved, we are going to run a

00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:49.010 line:100% position:50% align:middle
function which gives us a next value. So
this has to be a proper function,

00:09:49.010 --> 00:09:52.760 line:100% position:50% align:middle
not an arrow here. And the reason why is
because we need this.

00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:57.750 line:100% position:50% align:middle
What is this going to be equal to? This
will be equal to the Store that we are

00:09:57.750 --> 00:10:05.750 line:100% position:50% align:middle
trying to save. So we will say
this.slug=slug(this.name). And what that

00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:10.230 line:100% position:50% align:middle
will do is it will take the name that you
passed it, run it through our slug package

00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:14.093 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that we imported at the top here and set
the slug property to be

00:10:14.093 --> 00:10:16.510 line:100% position:50% align:middle
whatever the output of the slug is.

00:10:16.510 --> 00:10:19.320 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Once we've done that, we call next which
is...this is sort of,

00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:23.590 line:100% position:50% align:middle
like, a middleware as well where you set
the slug property and then you move along

00:10:23.590 --> 00:10:27.490 line:100% position:50% align:middle
which will allow us to save. Remember,
doing this before the save so the save

00:10:27.490 --> 00:10:32.110 line:100% position:50% align:middle
will not happen until we're done, whatever
work it is that we're trying to do inside

00:10:32.110 --> 00:10:36.680 line:100% position:50% align:middle
of this function. Now that will happen
every single time that we save a Store,

00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:41.650 line:100% position:50% align:middle
which is not what we need. We only need to
run this function when the name has been

00:10:41.650 --> 00:10:47.290 line:100% position:50% align:middle
changed. So we'll go up here. We'll say if
[inaudible] this.isModified,

00:10:47.290 --> 00:10:53.970 line:100% position:50% align:middle
name, so we wanna say if the Store's name
is not modified then we just want to call

00:10:53.970 --> 00:11:02.030 line:100% position:50% align:middle
next, skip it, and return which will stop
this function from running.

00:11:02.030 --> 00:11:06.820 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Sometimes you'll see people say return
next in one line, absolutely fine as well.

00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:12.950 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I'm just doing it for explicitly sake, to
be explicit. So we have our next,

00:11:12.950 --> 00:11:17.210 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we have a return if the name is not, we're
going to skip it. Otherwise,

00:11:17.210 --> 00:11:21.220 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we're going to set the slug to be the slug
of this.name and call next.

00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:26.890 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now, that is going to be okay for now but
we're going to come back and do a little

00:11:26.890 --> 00:11:31.920 line:100% position:50% align:middle
bit more advanced version in the future.
Because if people have a store named Tim

00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:36.150 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Hortons, then you're going to have
overlapping slugs, and you can't have

00:11:36.150 --> 00:11:42.870 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that. So we'll come back and it will say
TODO make more resilient so slugs are

00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:46.920 line:100% position:50% align:middle
unique, and we'll check there. So we can
do unique 1, unique 2,

00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:51.640 line:100% position:50% align:middle
unique 3, depending on if that slug
already exists. Good. Give it a quick

00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:56.952 line:100% position:50% align:middle
refresh. No errors, I'm happy. Let's move
on to actually saving some data.

00:11:57.751 --> 00:12:00.157 line:100% position:50% align:middle
