00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.570 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Let's get this Add page working. Right now
if you click on if you get 404,

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.090 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and that's because we don't have a route
set up for it. So let's open up our

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:24.820 line:100% position:50% align:middle
index.js inside of our routes folder, and
let's just duplicate this route and say

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:30.420 line:100% position:50% align:middle
('/add', and we want to have
storeController.addStore);. Now we'll go

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.300 line:100% position:50% align:middle
over to our storeController file, and
we're going to add a new one.

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:40.350 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So it's going to be exports.addStore =, we
have our req and we have our res.

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:46.020 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And from that, let's just say res.send,
response.send('It works');.

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.050 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Let's just check that that sucker works.
And now when you refresh,

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.520 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you should see "It works" show up.

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.600 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now we don't actually want to send that.
We want to render out one of our

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.770 line:100% position:50% align:middle
templates. So we'll say res.render, and
the template that we want to render our,

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:02.520 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we're going to call it ('editStore'). And
the reason I'm not calling this

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:08.180 line:100% position:50% align:middle
('addStore') is because I want to use the
same template, whether we're adding a new

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.100 line:100% position:50% align:middle
store or whether we're editing an existing
store. That keeps the number of templates

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.300 line:100% position:50% align:middle
down. It keeps our code as dry as
possible. What is the data that we need to

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:21.490 line:100% position:50% align:middle
pass to this? Well, we need to add the {
title: which is called 'Add Store' });.

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.080 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So now if we save that we're going to get
an error, because this doesn't exist,

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.080 line:100% position:50% align:middle
but let's see. There we go, "Failed to
lookup 'editStore. '" So we'll go into our

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:36.500 line:100% position:50% align:middle
views directory here. We make a new file,
and we'll call it editStore.pug.

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.780 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And we'll do exactly what we've been doing
for the rest of them.extends layout,

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.034 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and we'll have our block content.

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.530 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Some HTML that needs to be displayed onto
the page. So that's what we're going to

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:02.490 line:100% position:50% align:middle
do. We're going to open up our views
folder and open up our mixins folder.

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:06.230 line:100% position:50% align:middle
There's nothing inside of there right now,
but we're going to create our first

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:09.710 line:100% position:50% align:middle
mixins. We're going to create a new file
here. And we're going to call it,

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:14.870 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I like to prefix mine with _. However,
that is 100% not necessary.

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:19.300 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I just like to do it as a naming
convention. We do that in SAS.

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:24.140 line:100% position:50% align:middle
It's nice to sort of keep that convention
going in Pug. So we're going to call it

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:29.860 line:100% position:50% align:middle
_storeForm, capital "F," .pug. And we're
going to define what the mixin looks like.

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:32.730 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So the way that you define the mixin is
you simply just say mixin.

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:36.800 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And you name the mixin that you want, it's
just like a function.

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:44.250 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we'll call it storeForm. And that will
take in a (store, which is going to be for

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:48.500 line:100% position:50% align:middle
when we edit it. And it's going to default
into an empty object.

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:51.500 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So for now, we don't actually need the
store because we're not editing a store

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:55.200 line:100% position:50% align:middle
just yet. We're just adding one. But we're
going to put that there so that if someone

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:59.810 line:100% position:50% align:middle
does pass a store, we have the information
for how to use it. Otherwise,

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:05.710 line:100% position:50% align:middle
if someone does not pass a store, this is
what this does. It falls back to an empty

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:10.190 line:100% position:50% align:middle
object, and this is exactly the same in
ES6 as well. So we see that Pug has

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:13.050 line:100% position:50% align:middle
brought a lot of the things over from
JavaScript. And from that,

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:18.120 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you can start to just maybe you put a
paragraph, it works. Let's try that.

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:23.610 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now to go back to our editStore, what we
need to do is import the actual mixin that

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:29.910 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we need. The way that you import a mixin
is you include mixins/ and then the name

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:34.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
of the mixin, _storeForm. And what that
will do is it will make all of the mixins

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:39.580 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that you've defined in this file available
to us as functions that live inside of

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:43.530 line:100% position:50% align:middle
this Pug file. So you can have multiple
mixins inside of a file,

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:48.480 line:100% position:50% align:middle
but I generally keep it one mixin to one
file. So we've got mixins/_storeForm.

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:53.480 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And then to use a mixin you simply use the
+ sign. You have the storeForm.

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:59.280 line:100% position:50% align:middle
What that will do, the + will tell Pug
that we are using a mixin and we're

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:03.400 line:100% position:50% align:middle
running the function here. So give that a
Save now, refresh. You see it works.

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:08.430 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Why? Because the code that is inside of
here will be then used.

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:14.460 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And you can also pass it some data like
store. You could say the ({ name: is 'Tim

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:19.140 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Hortons'}). And here you could say "It
works!" And we could interpolate the

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:24.580 line:100% position:50% align:middle
#{store.name}. So now it should say, "It
works! Tim Hortons." There we go.

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:29.920 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Why? Because we passed in an object, which
was a store. And then it accepts an

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:36.330 line:100% position:50% align:middle
object, which we also call store. And then
you can use all the properties on that

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:39.480 line:100% position:50% align:middle
object that got passed in. It works just
like a function in JavaScript.

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:44.350 line:100% position:50% align:middle
It accepts some parameters, and then we
can then use that parameter and all of the

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:48.250 line:100% position:50% align:middle
properties on it. Now we're not going to
use that just yet, but once we get into

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:51.730 line:100% position:50% align:middle
editing a store we will use it.
So let's back that up there.

00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:56.760 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Good. Now let's get rid of that paragraph
tag and get to editing our form.

00:06:56.760 --> 00:07:02.600 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So the first thing that we need to do is
have a form. And the (action is going to

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:10.190 line:100% position:50% align:middle
be "/add" and the method is going to be
"POST." I like to capitalize that.

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:13.390 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And this is a little bit weird, but this
is because we're going to be uploading

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:21.360 line:100% position:50% align:middle
photos. So we're going to say
enctype="multipart/form-data." And then

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:24.990 line:100% position:50% align:middle
finally, you want to give it a class of
"card"), and that's just so that the CSS

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:27.220 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that I've written will kick in.

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:30.660 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now inside of that, make sure your...see
how we're indented one level deep right

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:37.300 line:100% position:50% align:middle
here? Now we want a label(for="name"), and
then you want to input the type of text,

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:43.380 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the name of Name. So let's see if that's
working now. Good. So we have our store

00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:47.190 line:100% position:50% align:middle
form. We have "Name." This is where we're
going to type in the actual name.

00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:52.180 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now let's go back to our model and just
see what other fields that we need,

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:59.900 line:100% position:50% align:middle
right? So we need a name. And the name of
your name...that's a poor naming because

00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:03.400 line:100% position:50% align:middle
now everything is named name. But let's
look at a different one.

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:07.710 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Description, let's do that. So we will
have label(for="description").

00:08:07.710 --> 00:08:14.820 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Say Description. And then we have an
input(type of "text," and the name is

00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:22.600 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"description"). Now the name that gets
posted, it needs to line up with the name

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:28.620 line:100% position:50% align:middle
inside of your schema, right? So it's
going to be a String. Then we'll go down.

00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:33.820 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We have the description. And then we also
wanted to work with some tags, right?

00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:38.200 line:100% position:50% align:middle
There's going to be no input for the slug,
because that's going to be auto-generated,

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:43.200 line:100% position:50% align:middle
but we do need to be able to let the
person choose from multiple tags.

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:47.740 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So how would this work? Well, you could
pull a list of available tags and have

00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:51.730 line:100% position:50% align:middle
them, or you could have a predefined set
of tags. And that's what we're going to be

00:08:51.730 --> 00:08:56.360 line:100% position:50% align:middle
doing. We're going to first have an array
of tags, and then we're going to loop over

00:08:56.360 --> 00:09:00.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
each of them. So we're going to say -,
that means we're running JavaScript

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.890 line:100% position:50% align:middle
because we just need to make a quick
variable here before we actually render

00:09:03.890 --> 00:09:04.810 line:100% position:50% align:middle
any pug.

00:09:04.810 --> 00:09:14.210 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So the choices is going to be = ['Wifi',
'Open Late', 'Family Friendly',

00:09:14.210 --> 00:09:20.680 line:100% position:50% align:middle
'Vegatarian', and 'Licensed']. So that's
all of our variables that we have here.

00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:24.740 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Then we're going to take those variables
and loop over them. So we'll give

00:09:24.740 --> 00:09:29.690 line:100% position:50% align:middle
ourselves an unordered list of the class
of tags. And then how do you loop in Pug?

00:09:29.690 --> 00:09:35.600 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Well, you use something called an each. So
you say each choice in choices,

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:40.250 line:100% position:50% align:middle
so that's sort of like a dot for each in
JavaScript, but this is the syntax for it.

00:09:40.250 --> 00:09:45.370 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So if choices is our array, choice is
going to be each individual one.

00:09:45.370 --> 00:09:48.590 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Then we can go inside of that and just
start writing some more pugs.

00:09:48.590 --> 00:09:52.380 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we're going to say class of tag, and
the class of tag__choice.

00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:57.650 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I'm using some BEM syntax here that my CSS
kicks in. That's nothing special,

00:09:57.650 --> 00:09:59.640 line:100% position:50% align:middle
this __. That has nothing to do with Pug.
That's just how I like to write my

00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:06.280 line:100% position:50% align:middle
mark-up. So BEM will kick in, and then for
that we'll have an input with (type of

00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:12.450 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"checkbox"). Let's see how far that gets
us. So we should have one,

00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:16.840 line:100% position:50% align:middle
two, three, four, five. We should have
five checkboxes now showing up.

00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:19.400 line:100% position:50% align:middle
There we go, there's
five empty checkboxes.

00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:24.260 line:100% position:50% align:middle
The id of that is going to be just choice.
So you notice how there's no quotes around

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:31.780 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that. Why? Because choice is a variable.
The value is going to also be choice.

00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:35.610 line:100% position:50% align:middle
The name is going to be "tags" so the name
in there is really important because that

00:10:35.610 --> 00:10:40.080 line:100% position:50% align:middle
will line up to the data being sent to our
server. And then below it,

00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:48.630 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we need to have a label just (for our
choice). And inside of that we can put our

00:10:48.630 --> 00:10:49.130 line:100% position:50% align:middle
#{choice} name.

00:10:49.130 --> 00:10:54.730 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we can either do the interpolation,
which is #{} and then the variable.

00:10:54.730 --> 00:10:58.320 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Or you can use a syntax = choice. Both of
those are going to work.

00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:01.860 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Here, let me show you. So you see, "Family
Friend," "Open Late." Or I could

00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:08.120 line:100% position:50% align:middle
interpolate it with the bang {} choice,
and that will do exactly the same thing.

00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:12.090 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we'll leave it at this because we did
it the other way last time.

00:11:12.090 --> 00:11:17.200 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Okay, good. Now we finally need an input
with the type of submit.

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:24.070 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So input(type="submit". And value is going
to be "Save. And give it a class of

00:11:24.070 --> 00:11:28.280 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"button" just so that the CSS will kick in
some nice styles. There we go,

00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:34.130 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we have a Save, and a Name and a
Description. Now what happens when I fill

00:11:34.130 --> 00:11:35.090 line:100% position:50% align:middle
this out?

00:11:35.090 --> 00:11:39.270 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Oh, one last thing. I goofed us up. The
description is only one line.

00:11:39.270 --> 00:11:43.500 line:100% position:50% align:middle
This description shouldn't be an input, it
should be a textarea.

00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:47.280 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And there is no type on a textarea,
because it should be multi-line.

00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:52.650 line:100% position:50% align:middle
There we go, this gives us multi-line. So
if I have a Name, like "Wes." I have a

00:11:52.650 --> 00:11:58.270 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Description, "its good." And then I add a
couple tags and click on Save.

00:11:58.270 --> 00:12:04.230 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Notice how we're on /add. Click Save. What
happens? We go back to /add,

00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:10.385 line:100% position:50% align:middle
but we get a 404. And why is that? Well,
if you look at a form tag,

00:12:10.385 --> 00:12:15.017 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the form tag always includes two important
pieces of information about what should

00:12:15.017 --> 00:12:18.573 line:100% position:50% align:middle
happen when somebody
clicks on Submit for that form.

00:12:18.573 --> 00:12:20.750 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So the action tells the browser where to
send the data, and the method tells the

00:12:20.750 --> 00:12:25.260 line:100% position:50% align:middle
browser how to send the data. So the two
different ones in HTML,

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:33.800 line:100% position:50% align:middle
there's a couple other ones you can use in
JavaScript, but these are two simple ones

00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:39.560 line:100% position:50% align:middle
in HTML, are POST and GET. POST will send
the data sort of invisibly,

00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:44.550 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and it will make it invisible. And that's
great for when you don't want the data to

00:12:44.550 --> 00:12:48.470 line:100% position:50% align:middle
show up in the URL if it's a data like a
username and a password.

00:12:48.470 --> 00:12:52.370 line:100% position:50% align:middle
You don't want that to show up in a URL.
The other one is called GET,

00:12:52.370 --> 00:12:56.930 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and that will actually put the data in the
URL. And that's helpful for if you want to

00:12:56.930 --> 00:12:56.990 line:100% position:50% align:middle
make a bookmarkable URL.

00:12:56.990 --> 00:13:03.330 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So maybe if I refresh this...actually, if
you refresh a page that has been posted

00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:09.110 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to, the browser says, "Oh, do you actually
want to resubmit that form that you just

00:13:09.110 --> 00:13:14.060 line:100% position:50% align:middle
did?" And you push Continue. You still get
a 404 page. I refresh.

00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:18.560 line:100% position:50% align:middle
See how you can't get back to our form
page? That's because we're in a post value

00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:22.420 line:100% position:50% align:middle
right now. But if you actually click on
Add once more, it will bring us back to

00:13:22.420 --> 00:13:24.060 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that Add Store URL.

00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:29.470 line:100% position:50% align:middle
But if I say "wes, cool." And then I take
Open Late, and Wifi,

00:13:29.470 --> 00:13:34.830 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and Licensed, and Save it, you'll see in
the URL, because we set it to GET,

00:13:34.830 --> 00:13:39.040 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the URL is now showing us the Name was
"Wes", the Description was "cool," and the

00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:45.830 line:100% position:50% align:middle
tags, "Wifi, Open Late," and "Licensed."
So that's what GET does,

00:13:45.830 --> 00:13:48.710 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and that would be great if I was searching
something I wanted to bookmark it,

00:13:48.710 --> 00:13:52.400 line:100% position:50% align:middle
send it to a friend. But in our case, we
don't want that. We want POST,

00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:55.420 line:100% position:50% align:middle
so we want all that data
to be sent invisibly.

00:13:55.420 --> 00:14:04.800 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So now let's take that off the URL, and
submit it, "wes, testing," click a couple.

00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:08.390 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We're going to get a 404. Why is that?
Well, if we go back to our routes,

00:14:08.390 --> 00:14:14.130 line:100% position:50% align:middle
right here, you'll see that we say
router.get('/add', and that means when you

00:14:14.130 --> 00:14:19.700 line:100% position:50% align:middle
visit a page by default, you're getting
that page. But you can also post to a

00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:24.330 line:100% position:50% align:middle
page, and that's generally when a form is
submitted or you are posting to that with

00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:28.660 line:100% position:50% align:middle
a library like jQuery, or Axios, or
whatever library you're using.

00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:35.340 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So what we actually want to do is say
router.post('/add'). So when someone posts

00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:39.710 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to the add, we want to use
storeController. And the method that we're

00:14:39.710 --> 00:14:45.330 line:100% position:50% align:middle
going to create is called createStore, so
storeController.createStore);.

00:14:45.330 --> 00:14:49.920 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now we'll go back to our Controller here
and we'll add a new one,

00:14:49.920 --> 00:15:00.530 line:100% position:50% align:middle
exports.createStore = (req, res) =>. And
let's do res.json. Now how do we get the

00:15:00.530 --> 00:15:04.880 line:100% position:50% align:middle
data? Let's just do this, we submit the
form, and let's immediately send the data

00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:09.250 line:100% position:50% align:middle
back to the user in JSON.
So we'll say res.json.

00:15:09.250 --> 00:15:16.390 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And now if we take (req.body);,
(req.body); is going to contain all of the

00:15:16.390 --> 00:15:22.680 line:100% position:50% align:middle
information about what got sent to it. Oh,
you see this, I forgot an "S." So if I

00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:28.900 line:100% position:50% align:middle
fill out this form, "WEs, Cool," and click
a couple tags, click Save.

00:15:28.900 --> 00:15:35.520 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Click on Save. Oh, we actually don't get
any data. (req.body); should be showing us

00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:39.300 line:100% position:50% align:middle
all of the data that we posted to it. So
let's take a quick look at our form here,

00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:45.050 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and I think what the problem is, is this
enctype="multipart/form-data".

00:15:45.050 --> 00:15:49.020 line:100% position:50% align:middle
This is a special encoding type that you
need when you upload images.

00:15:49.020 --> 00:15:52.550 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And we need to handle that properly when
we start uploading images.

00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:56.800 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we actually don't need this just yet.
We're going to come back and modify the

00:15:56.800 --> 00:15:59.420 line:100% position:50% align:middle
form once we start uploading our image and
take care of that.

00:15:59.420 --> 00:16:05.200 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So try to take that out, and let's see. If
we go back to our form here,

00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:09.210 line:100% position:50% align:middle
click on Add again. Make sure you actually
do a page refresh because we want to make

00:16:09.210 --> 00:16:13.050 line:100% position:50% align:middle
sure that that HTML is gone, it's not a
cache version. So "Wes,

00:16:13.050 --> 00:16:18.110 line:100% position:50% align:middle
cool." Let's try a couple things, click
Save. There we go. Okay,

00:16:18.110 --> 00:16:23.560 line:100% position:50% align:middle
good. So our storeController is now just
sending back (req.body);,

00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:26.890 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and we see this entire object.
Alternatively, if you're ever working and

00:16:26.890 --> 00:16:31.360 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you want to see what's being posted, you
can just quickly console.log (req.body);.

00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:37.250 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And now when you go back here, you can
always hit Cmd+K to just clear out your

00:16:37.250 --> 00:16:41.840 line:100% position:50% align:middle
terminal and give it a refresh.
You want to Continue.

00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:46.880 line:100% position:50% align:middle
You'll see that you can also console.log
all of the data that is being posted,

00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:51.350 line:100% position:50% align:middle
so name, description, and tags, all of the
data is now available to us.

00:16:51.350 --> 00:16:56.310 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Okay, cool, but what's the point of just
taking the data and sending them back to

00:16:56.310 --> 00:17:02.770 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the person? No, what we actually want to
do is to save that data (req.body),

00:17:02.770 --> 00:17:07.270 line:100% position:50% align:middle
back to the database. And in the next
video we're going to look at how to use

00:17:07.270 --> 00:17:11.200 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Mongoose, which is our library to
interface with MongoDB, as well as a new

00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:16.025 line:100% position:50% align:middle
thing in JavaScript called "async await"
to actually save the data to our database

00:17:16.025 --> 00:17:17.320 line:100% position:50% align:middle
so it persists.

00:17:17.320 --> 00:17:20.320 line:100% position:50% align:middle
