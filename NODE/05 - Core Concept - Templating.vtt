00:00:12.149 --> 00:00:15.565 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we looked at different ways to
send data to the browser via send,

00:00:15.565 --> 00:00:19.270 line:100% position:50% align:middle
in JSON, and whatnot,
but the one that we're going to

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:23.180 line:100% position:50% align:middle
be using quite a bit when we're not
dealing with API endpoints is something

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:29.180 line:100% position:50% align:middle
called res.render. So response.render.
And what that will do is it's going to

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:33.661 line:100% position:50% align:middle
render out a template for us. So this
video's going to be all about learning how

00:00:33.661 --> 00:00:38.510 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to use our templating language
called Pug. Now, first things first,

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.940 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Pug is a templating language that
is very popular in the node community.

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.520 line:100% position:50% align:middle
It used to be called Jade. So if you're
ever looking for help on this stuff, it

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:50.750 line:100% position:50% align:middle
could be helpful to search for Jade. I
think they switched the name over because

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:55.230 line:100% position:50% align:middle
of some legal reason. So Jade is our
templating engine and you can look in

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:01.030 line:100% position:50% align:middle
app.js on around line 20 and 21. And what
that's going to show you is that, first of

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:06.900 line:100% position:50% align:middle
all, we have what's called a views folder.
And the views folder is where all of our

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.620 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Pug files are going to live. So anytime
we need to create a template,

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:14.050 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that goes inside of our views folder
and that's determined right here.

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:18.960 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Next we set our view engine to be Pug.
However, there are other alternatives if

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you do not prefer. Pug is based on
indentation, which some people absolutely

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.710 line:100% position:50% align:middle
love. Some people just can't deal with
it at all. So there's other templating

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:33.410 line:100% position:50% align:middle
engines called Mustache in EJS
if you prefer either of those as well.

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:36.600 line:100% position:50% align:middle
You could even do this entire tutorial in
a different templating engine if you

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.940 line:100% position:50% align:middle
already know that. You would just
switch that out here at that moment.

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:46.724 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now, that's fine, so we can close down
app.js. Then we go to our...let's go to

00:01:46.724 --> 00:01:53.810 line:100% position:50% align:middle
our first route here, router.get/. How
we can then render out a template,

00:01:53.810 --> 00:02:00.001 line:100% position:50% align:middle
is not request response at JSON, but
it's response.render. And response.render

00:02:00.001 --> 00:02:03.980 line:100% position:50% align:middle
is going to take two things. First, it
needs a name of a template to render out.

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:07.786 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we need to make one. So let's go to
our views directory here and I'm going to

00:02:07.786 --> 00:02:15.550 line:100% position:50% align:middle
make a new file. Let's just call that
hello.pug, and then we can write inside of

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:18.430 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Pug. Now, we're going to go over
all the different pieces of Pug

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:23.140 line:100% position:50% align:middle
but let's just get it working. And how Pug
works is that you do not give yourself

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:28.909 line:100% position:50% align:middle
tags like an open paragraph, close
paragraph, hello, close it. You simply

00:02:28.909 --> 00:02:32.882 line:100% position:50% align:middle
just give it the opening tag that you wish
to have and then you type your content

00:02:32.882 --> 00:02:37.820 line:100% position:50% align:middle
inside of it. So we'll go over it a
little bit more but that's our very basic

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:42.630 line:100% position:50% align:middle
getting set up. So we want to render out
the hello template. You don't need to put

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:47.850 line:100% position:50% align:middle
a .pug on the end, so it's just hello. And
then the second thing we pass is local

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:52.140 line:100% position:50% align:middle
variables, some information that it
needs. So right now let's just go without

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:58.270 line:100% position:50% align:middle
those. We'll render out hello.pug.
So let's go back to our application,

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:02.610 line:100% position:50% align:middle
get that working, and you should see
hello being rendered out to the page.

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:08.410 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Okay. That seems simple enough. We've
got our hello.pug, it's going to be turned

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:13.210 line:100% position:50% align:middle
into regular HTML. If you inspect it, you
can see exactly what's going on here.

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:17.054 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We've got a paragraph tag. And then the
HTML, the head, the body, all of that

00:03:17.054 --> 00:03:20.547 line:100% position:50% align:middle
stuff is just there. Because if the
browser does not receive any of it,

00:03:20.547 --> 00:03:23.353 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it will insert it in there for us.

00:03:23.353 --> 00:03:28.122 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So let's go through some of
our basics when dealing with Pug.

00:03:28.122 --> 00:03:32.620 line:100% position:50% align:middle
First thing that we need to know is that
you have a tag, a space, and then you have

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:36.940 line:100% position:50% align:middle
all of your elements inside of it.
If you wish to nest your elements,

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:39.940 line:100% position:50% align:middle
like let's say you have a div and
inside of that you want a paragraph,

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:44.230 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you need to indent it one level. And this
is really important because, I know that

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:47.310 line:100% position:50% align:middle
some people, when they're first getting
started with coding, they're a little bit

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:52.100 line:100% position:50% align:middle
sloppy with their indentation practices.
And this going to force you to get really

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:56.300 line:100% position:50% align:middle
good at your indentation. So first thing
you need to do is to pick your indentation

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:59.660 line:100% position:50% align:middle
standard. I use two spaces, you
might use four, you might use tabs,

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:05.430 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it doesn't matter as long as you pick one
and do not ever stray from it for this

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:09.050 line:100% position:50% align:middle
entire project. So I'm using two spaces,
you can see in my editor I've set that up.

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:13.190 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and then you simply just nest it
inside of it. So I have a div and I have

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:18.522 line:100% position:50% align:middle
a paragraph, and maybe inside of that I
want a span with "Yo." You add a save.

00:04:18.522 --> 00:04:23.070 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now when I refresh. You can inspect this
and you can see that we've got all of our

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:27.458 line:100% position:50% align:middle
different elements here. Close that sucker
down. There we go. We got a div, we got

00:04:27.458 --> 00:04:31.490 line:100% position:50% align:middle
a paragraph, we got a span.
They will be turned on over.

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:37.016 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now, what if we want classes on it, like a
wrapper? So we can say div.wrapper.

00:04:37.016 --> 00:04:42.702 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And if you want a class on the paragraph
with "hello." And then if you want an ID,

00:04:42.702 --> 00:04:49.672 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you use #, just like CSS, selectors
will be, put "yo." Out of that. Refresh.

00:04:49.672 --> 00:04:53.970 line:100% position:50% align:middle
You see a div with a class of wrapper,
class of hello, ID. You have multiple

00:04:53.970 --> 00:05:00.882 line:100% position:50% align:middle
".ohonoooo." It will give both of
those classes as you need. So you can

00:05:00.882 --> 00:05:07.964 line:100% position:50% align:middle
dot, dot, and #. Another hot
tip is if it's just a div, it's assumed.

00:05:07.964 --> 00:05:11.815 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So you do not need, you can
simply just type .wrapper in front of it

00:05:11.815 --> 00:05:16.370 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and it will always give you a div. So if
you leave the element type out,

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:20.765 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it will assume that it is always a div.
And then we also need to know about

00:05:20.765 --> 00:05:26.784 line:100% position:50% align:middle
attributes. So let's say I have an image
tag here. How do I give it a source?

00:05:26.784 --> 00:05:32.093 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Well, you use parentheses here, and then
you can give it all of your attributes

00:05:32.093 --> 00:05:40.627 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that you need. So src="dog.jpg," and
then you'd do a space, which is alt="Dog."

00:05:40.627 --> 00:05:44.855 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Got to save. And then here, image
source, it goes alt. I believe you

00:05:44.855 --> 00:05:49.285 line:100% position:50% align:middle
can also do commas in it, if you prefer
that. Yep. That will work just fine.

00:05:49.285 --> 00:05:54.114 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So if you prefer to do a comma, but I like
to keep my syntax as minimal as possible.

00:05:54.114 --> 00:06:00.662 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And you can, of course, mix that with a
dog class and have a source in there.

00:06:00.662 --> 00:06:05.059 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So, class of dog, a source of
dog, .jpeg and alt of dog in there.

00:06:05.059 --> 00:06:09.965 line:100% position:50% align:middle
What else do we need to learn?
Obviously, have all of your h-2 tags,

00:06:09.965 --> 00:06:14.036 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"hello," all of your headings, all
of your HTML works just the same.

00:06:14.036 --> 00:06:17.778 line:100% position:50% align:middle
But if you ever need to nest something
inside of another element, you can do

00:06:17.778 --> 00:06:21.440 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that. Maybe if you have a "hello"
there, and then a span that says,

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:27.256 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"How are you?" with maybe emphasis
inside of that, that will work just fine.

00:06:27.256 --> 00:06:31.574 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Although, if that bugs you a little bit,
and you wish to put the "hello" and the

00:06:31.574 --> 00:06:35.682 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"How are you?" on their own line, what you
can do is you can put it on its own line,

00:06:35.682 --> 00:06:39.783 line:100% position:50% align:middle
but now what's going to happen
if I save that, open up the h-2,

00:06:39.783 --> 00:06:43.763 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you'll see that we get a "hello" tag,
which is not what you want.

00:06:43.763 --> 00:06:48.131 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So, like, how would you just put the
content? Well, you pipe space and that

00:06:48.131 --> 00:06:53.332 line:100% position:50% align:middle
will give you the actual. So the Pug
and the jdocs are really good at telling

00:06:53.332 --> 00:06:56.163 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you what is the equivalent.
It's a little bit of a learning curve,

00:06:56.163 --> 00:06:59.741 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to understand, but we're going to be
learning how we do all of the different

00:06:59.741 --> 00:07:03.115 line:100% position:50% align:middle
pieces. We're going to be looking at how
do you do looping inside of here, how do

00:07:03.115 --> 00:07:08.004 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you do logic, how do you do advanced
templating, how do you do mix-ins.

00:07:08.004 --> 00:07:10.721 line:100% position:50% align:middle
There's a whole bunch that we can do and
we're going to learn it as we go along.

00:07:10.721 --> 00:07:17.158 line:100% position:50% align:middle
But for now, what you need to know is how
we create elements and nest them inside

00:07:17.158 --> 00:07:21.422 line:100% position:50% align:middle
of each other. The other thing I want to
tell you is how do you get information

00:07:21.422 --> 00:07:27.488 line:100% position:50% align:middle
from your route, which will come from,
maybe from a database that we're going to

00:07:27.488 --> 00:07:31.624 line:100% position:50% align:middle
do, or it comes from your URL, how do you
get that information to your actual

00:07:31.624 --> 00:07:35.630 line:100% position:50% align:middle
template? So the way that you do that is
you have to pass it when you render.

00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:41.047 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we pass it in object here, and then
that object will contain all of the

00:07:41.047 --> 00:07:46.418 line:100% position:50% align:middle
information that we have. So maybe we
say name is Wes, and dog is Snickers.

00:07:46.418 --> 00:07:52.668 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Then you go into here, "Hello, how are
you?" And we can reference those variables

00:07:52.668 --> 00:07:58.949 line:100% position:50% align:middle
inside of it. So let's say, "Hello, my
dog's name is." Now how do we reference

00:07:58.949 --> 00:08:04.736 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it? You do #, curly brackets, and that's
how you interpolate a variable inside of

00:08:04.736 --> 00:08:11.460 line:100% position:50% align:middle
text in Pug. And you can simply just say
what the name was. So let's say dog.

00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:14.555 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Then, "Hello, my dog's name is
Snickers," and you could make that a

00:08:14.555 --> 00:08:21.188 line:100% position:50% align:middle
little bit dynamic. Where you could do
query mark, dog= with Hugo,

00:08:21.188 --> 00:08:27.337 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and we could make that dynamic by
saying the dog's is...  how, you tell me.

00:08:27.337 --> 00:08:37.039 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Request.query.dog. So my dog's name is
Hugo, Snickers, Wes, you see how it's

00:08:37.039 --> 00:08:41.285 line:100% position:50% align:middle
pulling it in, passing it along to the
templating. So whenever you need to

00:08:41.285 --> 00:08:46.673 line:100% position:50% align:middle
get information over to your template,
these are called local variables,

00:08:46.673 --> 00:08:51.507 line:100% position:50% align:middle
or locals as they're often called, in
EXPRESS land, that's how we pass it along.

00:08:51.507 --> 00:08:57.500 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And we can do things like dog. Another
thing that we need to know is let's say we

00:08:57.500 --> 00:09:03.630 line:100% position:50% align:middle
wanted to put the dog's name in the alt
tag. Previously, in Jade, what you would

00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:08.152 line:100% position:50% align:middle
do is you would do a # like that, and you
would say dog. But it actually doesn't

00:09:08.152 --> 00:09:13.288 line:100% position:50% align:middle
work. You'll see that it actually just
writes the word. So how do you put

00:09:13.288 --> 00:09:16.933 line:100% position:50% align:middle
variables into attributes?
This is how you put variables into text.

00:09:16.933 --> 00:09:22.737 line:100% position:50% align:middle
But they've taken away the ability to put
variables into attributes unless you just

00:09:22.737 --> 00:09:26.777 line:100% position:50% align:middle
use JavaScript. So how do you do that
in JavaScript? Well, you use back ticks

00:09:26.777 --> 00:09:32.548 line:100% position:50% align:middle
instead, and then you use ESX template
literals, which is a $ curly brackets

00:09:32.548 --> 00:09:39.452 line:100% position:50% align:middle
instead of #. And then that will pass
along the dog's name into the alt of the

00:09:39.452 --> 00:09:45.240 line:100% position:50% align:middle
actual image. So that's a little bit
funky, because you have to remember that

00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:50.205 line:100% position:50% align:middle
when you're writing text it's #, but
when you're trying to do an attribute,

00:09:50.205 --> 00:09:55.893 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you have to use back ticks and
a $. So it's a bit unfortunate,

00:09:55.893 --> 00:09:58.637 line:100% position:50% align:middle
but that's just the way it is, and it
doesn't look like it's going to be

00:09:58.637 --> 00:10:02.459 line:100% position:50% align:middle
changed. So not the biggest deal in the
world because you can learn these things

00:10:02.459 --> 00:10:07.341 line:100% position:50% align:middle
pretty quickly. Another thing that you
need to know is that you can run any

00:10:07.341 --> 00:10:10.859 line:100% position:50% align:middle
JavaScript inside of this. So if you
needed to make a quick variable,

00:10:10.859 --> 00:10:15.213 line:100% position:50% align:middle
ideally you'd do all the work in here,
but if you do need to make a variable, you

00:10:15.213 --> 00:10:24.537 line:100% position:50% align:middle
can just use a minus sign, const upDog =
dog.toUpperCase. And then we can use

00:10:24.537 --> 00:10:29.355 line:100% position:50% align:middle
our updog variable in there, no
problem, and it will uppercase it for us.

00:10:29.355 --> 00:10:36.626 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Similarly, we can also dog.toUpperCase,
and that will do exactly the same thing.

00:10:36.626 --> 00:10:41.325 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So you can run JavaScript, and that's
really why I like using Pug a lot, because

00:10:41.325 --> 00:10:45.141 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it's JavaScript-based, and any
time you need to run some quick

00:10:45.141 --> 00:10:48.603 line:100% position:50% align:middle
JavaScript, whether it's to filter
something or whether it's to run a quick

00:10:48.603 --> 00:10:54.214 line:100% position:50% align:middle
uppercase or to split a string, then you
can also do that logic right inside of

00:10:54.214 --> 00:10:57.151 line:100% position:50% align:middle
your template. So we're going to be
looking deeper at some of those

00:10:57.151 --> 00:11:01.400 line:100% position:50% align:middle
self-looping logic mix-ins, if statements,
all that stuff, as we go ahead.

00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:07.263 line:100% position:50% align:middle
But that's the very basics of
understanding our Pug. So this is all

00:11:07.263 --> 00:11:11.616 line:100% position:50% align:middle
great, but chances are that you want to
chunk your website into different pieces

00:11:11.616 --> 00:11:17.196 line:100% position:50% align:middle
like a header and a footer and a body tag,
and you want to reuse parts of your

00:11:17.196 --> 00:11:23.608 line:100% position:50% align:middle
website over and over again. So how we
actually do that is we extend templates,

00:11:23.608 --> 00:11:27.994 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and we sort of create like what I like to
call layouts. And then you leave little

00:11:27.994 --> 00:11:33.082 line:100% position:50% align:middle
holes in your layouts for the footer and
for the body content and whatnot,

00:11:33.082 --> 00:11:37.420 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and we just pass that in. Because right
now, we don't have our...I've got to do an

00:11:37.420 --> 00:11:42.707 line:100% position:50% align:middle
exclamation mark tab. And by the way,
that little thing, that's Emmet, if you're

00:11:42.707 --> 00:11:46.935 line:100% position:50% align:middle
ever wondering. Emmet works just fine in
Jade as well. So you can do things like

00:11:46.935 --> 00:11:57.076 line:100% position:50% align:middle
ul.dogs>li.dog.dog$$, then hit tab, and
give ten of them. That will give you all

00:11:57.076 --> 00:12:01.708 line:100% position:50% align:middle
of it. So that's Emmet, if you need it up
and running, we've used it in most of my

00:12:01.708 --> 00:12:05.879 line:100% position:50% align:middle
other courses. I recommend that
you get it for writing Pug as well.

00:12:05.879 --> 00:12:12.027 line:100% position:50% align:middle
But how do you get like the HTML tag in
all that? So if we go into our views

00:12:12.027 --> 00:12:16.182 line:100% position:50% align:middle
directory, and we open up layout.pug,
you'll see that I've actually set you up

00:12:16.182 --> 00:12:21.421 line:100% position:50% align:middle
with our base HTML. So we have
doc type HTML, here's our HTML tag,

00:12:21.421 --> 00:12:27.355 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we've got our head, and we have a title
tag, which means you should pass it a

00:12:27.355 --> 00:12:30.521 line:100% position:50% align:middle
title, and we also have a helpers,
I'll go into that in a second.

00:12:30.521 --> 00:12:35.145 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Link up our style at CSS, we're going to
link up our donut for the fav icon.

00:12:35.145 --> 00:12:40.555 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We have our body tag, which inside of it
will include what's called a block.

00:12:40.555 --> 00:12:46.051 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And a block is sort of like a section of
your website that can be filled in by

00:12:46.051 --> 00:12:50.277 line:100% position:50% align:middle
another template. And so we have our
header here, and then we put the content

00:12:50.277 --> 00:12:55.276 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that we wish for it to show if nothing
gets passed in. So by default you probably

00:12:55.276 --> 00:12:59.326 line:100% position:50% align:middle
aren't going to pass a custom header.
So we're going run this header,

00:12:59.326 --> 00:13:03.786 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and this may look like a little bit messy,
it may look like a lot right now.

00:13:03.786 --> 00:13:08.618 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We will go into understanding all of this
in the future, don't worry all that much.

00:13:08.618 --> 00:13:12.802 line:100% position:50% align:middle
But if you scroll down, all the way down,
all the way down, to where we say

00:13:12.802 --> 00:13:16.331 line:100% position:50% align:middle
.content, block content, so we
have a div with a class of content,

00:13:16.331 --> 00:13:21.877 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and that's where our blocked content goes.
What we can then do is go back to our

00:13:21.877 --> 00:13:27.225 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"hello" here. And we can, let's just
delete absolutely everything that we have

00:13:27.225 --> 00:13:32.912 line:100% position:50% align:middle
in there. We want to extend this layout,
we want to like use all of this layout and

00:13:32.912 --> 00:13:36.785 line:100% position:50% align:middle
then we just want to put our content in
this one little piece that we have right

00:13:36.785 --> 00:13:42.636 line:100% position:50% align:middle
here. So that's what we can do, we can say
"extends layout" and that will extend the

00:13:42.636 --> 00:13:45.524 line:100% position:50% align:middle
layout, and then you go ahead
and type all of your blocks.

00:13:45.524 --> 00:13:51.171 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we have block content, and inside of
the content block is now where we type

00:13:51.171 --> 00:13:56.822 line:100% position:50% align:middle
everything we want for it to put into
this block right here. So if I say

00:13:56.822 --> 00:14:01.578 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"p hello," what it's going to do is
it's going to take the paragraph and

00:14:01.578 --> 00:14:07.515 line:100% position:50% align:middle
replace this with "p hello" for us.
I'll give that a save and refresh.

00:14:07.515 --> 00:14:12.790 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And now you're going to see, whoa, now
we've got all of our website showing up.

00:14:12.790 --> 00:14:17.303 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We've got this header that I've already
done for you being clicked in.

00:14:17.303 --> 00:14:23.969 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And the "hello" is the only thing that
we've done here. We could also make a

00:14:23.969 --> 00:14:30.655 line:100% position:50% align:middle
block header and pass in a custom header,
like h1 "yo," and what that will do is

00:14:30.655 --> 00:14:36.073 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it will replace, because you'll see in our
layout.pug we have a block header,

00:14:36.073 --> 00:14:40.631 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and then we also have content in front of
that. So this will be the default header

00:14:40.631 --> 00:14:44.854 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that we have here. However, if you
ever are in a Pug file and you wish to

00:14:44.854 --> 00:14:50.675 line:100% position:50% align:middle
overwrite the default that you have there,
you can just specify the block header and

00:14:50.675 --> 00:14:53.600 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that will, instead of using
the default one that we have here,

00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:58.972 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it will replace it with whatever it is
that you have passed inside of there.

00:14:58.972 --> 00:15:05.749 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So you can also do that with our content
here. You could say like "p this is the

00:15:05.749 --> 00:15:10.571 line:100% position:50% align:middle
default," and if I do not pass anything,
this is the default, but if we go back to

00:15:10.571 --> 00:15:16.631 line:100% position:50% align:middle
content here and pass in "hello," now we
start to see hello. So that's what we're

00:15:16.631 --> 00:15:18.627 line:100% position:50% align:middle
going to be doing with all of our
templates. We're going to be

00:15:18.627 --> 00:15:24.328 line:100% position:50% align:middle
extending the layout. This is
sort of our overall layout for the

00:15:24.328 --> 00:15:29.239 line:100% position:50% align:middle
entire website. So it's not like a
WordPress where you have a page where you

00:15:29.239 --> 00:15:33.429 line:100% position:50% align:middle
pull in the pieces that you want,
it's more like you grab your layout,

00:15:33.429 --> 00:15:37.457 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and then you pass it the data that you
want, and the pieces that you wish to

00:15:37.457 --> 00:15:41.246 line:100% position:50% align:middle
override. So I don't have a footer here,
but if I wanted to, I would simply just

00:15:41.246 --> 00:15:47.351 line:100% position:50% align:middle
add in a footer element here, and we'd say
block footer, and then I would say like

00:15:47.351 --> 00:15:53.090 line:100% position:50% align:middle
something like copyright Wes Bos,
and I'll see what that does. So it

00:15:53.090 --> 00:15:58.913 line:100% position:50% align:middle
shows up, because I've put it in my
layout.pug. However, I'd be able to then

00:15:58.913 --> 00:16:04.449 line:100% position:50% align:middle
go in here and give ourselves a new block
called footer, and maybe I'll want to do

00:16:04.449 --> 00:16:12.382 line:100% position:50% align:middle
something funny like "p I love you," and
that's going to overwrite the default that

00:16:12.382 --> 00:16:16.343 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we've got in there. So hopefully that
makes sense, we'll be going over that a

00:16:16.343 --> 00:16:21.441 line:100% position:50% align:middle
lot more as we go along. But know that
your layout is your overall page layout

00:16:21.441 --> 00:16:27.386 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and your Pug files are simply going to
extend that layout by typing extend

00:16:27.386 --> 00:16:32.806 line:100% position:50% align:middle
layout. So we sort of use that layout.
And you can feather them in many levels,

00:16:32.806 --> 00:16:36.586 line:100% position:50% align:middle
but generally I just have one layout for
my front end, I have one layout if I have

00:16:36.586 --> 00:16:41.488 line:100% position:50% align:middle
like a custom back end that is totally
different, and then I just plop in

00:16:41.488 --> 00:16:43.709 line:100% position:50% align:middle
my content blocks as I need them.

00:16:44.323 --> 00:16:47.400 line:100% position:50% align:middle
