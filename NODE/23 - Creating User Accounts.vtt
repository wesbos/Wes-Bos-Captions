00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.160 line:100% position:50% align:middle
All right. We're going to cool it on the
stores part, and we're going to move into

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.870 line:100% position:50% align:middle
actually working with users on our
application. So we're going to be able to

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:23.130 line:100% position:50% align:middle
allow users to sign up, and everyone is
going to have an account.

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.820 line:100% position:50% align:middle
You can log in and register, and log out,
and create a store that's associated with

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:31.980 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you, and comment on other stores. That
comment will be associated for you,

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.040 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and all of that good stuff. You'll be able
to only edit a store that exists to you.

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:40.810 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So in order to get up and going with that,
we first need this login form,

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:44.550 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and then we're going to go forward and
start creating all of the pieces to log

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.590 line:100% position:50% align:middle
in. So click on your Log In. It's got a
404, because we don't have a route for

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:55.440 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that. So let's open up our index.js file
and go all the way to the bottom,

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:02.380 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and we'll say, "router.get('/login'".
When that happens, we are going to make a

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:06.440 line:100% position:50% align:middle
new controller, called the "User
controller" and we're going to just say,

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.530 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"loginForm". Now, why are we making a new
controller? Well, generally,

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.580 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you have one controller for every kind of
specific area of your website.

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.340 line:100% position:50% align:middle
For this, we're going to have a User
controller, which is going to take care of

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.270 line:100% position:50% align:middle
all of our signup and registration
validation, and logging out,

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.210 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and all the forms, password reset, and
what not. Then, we're going to have an

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.800 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Authentication controller, which will deal
with all of the heavy lifting for logging

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.010 line:100% position:50% align:middle
people in, making sure they're logged in,
making sure that they own the correct

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:37.700 line:100% position:50% align:middle
store, etc., etc. So it doesn't really
matter where they go in the controller.

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.890 line:100% position:50% align:middle
But it's just a nice way to chunk things
up and keep them with like code.

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.270 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we're going to create a User
controller. So we're going to go into our

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.264 line:100% position:50% align:middle
controllers, make a new file, and call it
"userController.js".

00:01:50.264 --> 00:01:53.690 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Then, we're going to import Mongoose
because that's what we need.

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:58.560 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So I'll say, "const mongoose =
require('mongoose')" and we'll say,

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:04.470 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"exports."... What did we look for? Login
form. "loginForm = (req,res)".

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.340 line:100% position:50% align:middle
This one doesn't need to be async.
That's all we're going to be doing is

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:15.790 line:100% position:50% align:middle
res.render out the login form, and the
title is going to be "Login Form," or just

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:21.250 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"Login," probably. Good. Now, finally, if
we try to run this, we're going to get a

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:25.920 line:100% position:50% align:middle
bit of an error. You see that my ESLint is
highlighting it and it's telling me that

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.730 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"User controller is not to find." Why? If
we go to the top of our routes,

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.660 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we're importing Store controller. But we
have to duplicate that and change out

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:38.780 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"Store" with "User." So we have the Store
controller is coming from that file.

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:44.040 line:100% position:50% align:middle
The User controller is coming from this
file. So now, we give that a refresh and

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.420 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we log in. It should tell us that we don't
have a login Pug file yet.

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.910 line:100% position:50% align:middle
There we go. "Failed to lookup view
'login' in views directory." So we don't

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:57.390 line:100% position:50% align:middle
have that view yet. We'll go into Views,
New File, Login.pug, and we'll do our

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:04.250 line:100% position:50% align:middle
whole song and dance, "extends layout",
"block content", "h2= title".

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:11.060 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Let's try that. Actually, we'll do
".inner", and then a title inside of that.

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:15.500 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now, we have a login showing up, and we
need to build the actual login form.

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:21.230 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now, rather than just do the login form
right in login.pug, I rather put it in a

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:25.980 line:100% position:50% align:middle
mixin, so that I can include that login
form anywhere I want. Whether it's in a

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.650 line:100% position:50% align:middle
popup or another piece of the website, I
can have it in a nice,

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:32.960 line:100% position:50% align:middle
little partial. So we're going to go to
Mixins. Create a new file called

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:40.440 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"_loginForm.pug". I'll say, "mixin
loginForm()" and nothing goes inside of

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.390 line:100% position:50% align:middle
those parenthesis because it doesn't take
any arguments. I'll say,

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:47.990 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"form" with a class of "form". The reason
we have a class of "form" is so that CSS

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:53.640 line:100% position:50% align:middle
will kick in. The action is going to be
"/login", and the method is going to be

00:03:53.640 --> 00:04:01.380 line:100% position:50% align:middle
equal to "POST". Then, we'll have an h2
inside of that that says "login".

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:06.240 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We'll have a label for "email". We'll have
an input type of "email",

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:11.040 line:100% position:50% align:middle
a name of "email", and then we'll have an
input type of "password",

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:15.520 line:100% position:50% align:middle
name of "password". We'll have an
input.button, which has a type of

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:19.380 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"submit", and then the value is going to
be "Log In". Woo. All right.

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:24.570 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So I made a nice, little mixin there. We
can go back to our login.pug and import

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:32.370 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that mixin. Then, we can use our mixin,
"loginForm()". Let's see what that does

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:36.740 line:100% position:50% align:middle
for us, give it a refresh, and now we have
a login from... Oh,

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:43.960 line:100% position:50% align:middle
one thing we forgot was the actual email
address and password.

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:49.860 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We forgot our "label for password". There
we go. Login, email address,

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:52.430 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and password. We go up to our login.pug,
where we're using it.

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:57.580 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Actually, we don't need this h2 either.
That's just for the actual title bar.

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:02.380 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We've got our login page rendering. Good.
Now, comes the harder part.

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:07.140 line:100% position:50% align:middle
When somebody fills this in,
"wesbos@gmail.com", and I'm going to have

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:11.720 line:100% position:50% align:middle
my password as "wes", because that's
super-strong, and when we click Login,

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:17.080 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that data gets posted to the same route.
So much like when we added a store and we

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:22.560 line:100% position:50% align:middle
posted the data to /add, we also need to
now create a user and save it to the

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:27.600 line:100% position:50% align:middle
database. So how do we create a user? We
need a new model. Right?

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:31.160 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Remember models is where our data gets
stored, and we've already just done

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:41.520 line:100% position:50% align:middle
store.js? Let's make a new one. Call it
"user.js", and we'll start from scratch,

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:47.910 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"const mongoose = require('mongoose')".
Then, we also need this schema.

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:53.520 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Another thing we have to do is say,
"mongoose. Promise = global.

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:58.760 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Promise". Again, we shouldn't have to do
that. But there's a bug currently in the

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:02.850 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Mongoose package that will sort of give
you false positives in your console if you

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:06.700 line:100% position:50% align:middle
don't do that. It'll tell you that they've
deprecated their own internal promise

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:12.560 line:100% position:50% align:middle
library. Because we've done it in
start.js, this is the only time we should

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:17.440 line:100% position:50% align:middle
be telling it that we need to use ES6
promises. But if we don't do it in each of

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:21.420 line:100% position:50% align:middle
our models, it does this cranky complaint.
Even though it doesn't make any

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:27.880 line:100% position:50% align:middle
difference, that just suppresses the error
in our terminal if you ever see that.

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:30.800 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we've got Mongoose. We've got our
schema pulling in. A couple of other

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:34.340 line:100% position:50% align:middle
things that we need real quick is just a
few dependencies, and I will explain them

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:42.080 line:100% position:50% align:middle
as we start to use them. So I'll say,
"const md5 = require('md5')".

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:49.230 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We need a package called "Validator". We
need something called a

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:54.360 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"mongodbErrorHandler" and again I'll
explain all of this as we need it.

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:57.470 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Finally, something called
"passportLocalMongoose", which is going to

00:06:57.470 --> 00:07:02.520 line:100% position:50% align:middle
help us easily create user accounts
without doing a whole lot of boilerplate

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:10.150 line:100% position:50% align:middle
code, "passport-local-mongoose". Woo.
Okay. Again, don't worry too much about

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:13.410 line:100% position:50% align:middle
what these are. We will go into them in
just a second. So the first thing that we

00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:17.870 line:100% position:50% align:middle
need to do is actually make our model.
Again, our model is what our data is going

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:24.350 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to look like. So I'll say, "const
userSchema = new Schema". That is going to

00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:28.690 line:100% position:50% align:middle
take an object, and then right away we
should just go ahead and export that.

00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:36.803 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So, "module.exports = mongoose.model".
We're going to call this "User",

00:07:36.803 --> 00:07:41.230 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and we're going to give it the User Schema
that we've defined.

00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:45.560 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Again, we use module.exports there, and
not just exports.something,

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:49.500 line:100% position:50% align:middle
because this is the main thing that will
be exported from this file.

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:53.630 line:100% position:50% align:middle
When you require this file, that's the
thing that you're getting out of the file

00:07:53.630 --> 00:07:58.140 line:100% position:50% align:middle
without specifying a sub-property. So we
have our schema, and there are five things

00:07:58.140 --> 00:08:01.360 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that are going to go on our schema. But
for now, we really just need email and we

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:05.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
also need the name of the actual person.
So let's go through each of these.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:12.080 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"Email" is going to be a type of string.
It's going to be a unique that's "true",

00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:16.720 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and that's really important, because you
don't want people signing up for multiple

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:20.870 line:100% position:50% align:middle
accounts with the same email address. If
someone tries to sign up with an email

00:08:20.870 --> 00:08:25.820 line:100% position:50% align:middle
account that already exists, you should
tell them, "Hey, you can't do that.

00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:31.295 line:100% position:50% align:middle
That email address already exists." Then,
you want to say "lowercase: true" and this

00:08:31.295 --> 00:08:36.510 line:100% position:50% align:middle
is something I wish I knew earlier. When I
first made the thing that built my

00:08:36.510 --> 00:08:40.940 line:100% position:50% align:middle
courses, I was having all kinds of
trouble, because every single place that I

00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:44.410 line:100% position:50% align:middle
needed to use someone's email, I needed to
make sure that I lowercased it.

00:08:44.410 --> 00:08:47.570 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Because if somebody would sign in or sign
up, or buy a course,

00:08:47.570 --> 00:08:52.460 line:100% position:50% align:middle
or do anything with an uppercase email, or
even just a capital somewhere in there,

00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:57.780 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it would then not be the same email as the
lowercase version that I had on file.

00:08:57.780 --> 00:09:01.700 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So what you can do is you can say,
"lowercase: true" and that will always

00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:06.550 line:100% position:50% align:middle
save them in your database as lowercase.
Then, we also use a middleware that

00:09:06.550 --> 00:09:10.920 line:100% position:50% align:middle
whenever somebody submits an email
address, it's always going to just

00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:15.680 line:100% position:50% align:middle
automatically lowercase itself. So you
don't have to worry about case in any of

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:18.650 line:100% position:50% align:middle
these. It's nice to take that off your
plate. The next one is trim.

00:09:18.650 --> 00:09:22.100 line:100% position:50% align:middle
You want it to be "true", because people
sign in with all kinds of...

00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:26.290 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Like I see all kinds of people signing in
with emails like this,

00:09:26.290 --> 00:09:30.210 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"gmail.com", and then they have all kinds
of spaces on it. So if we put trim on it,

00:09:30.210 --> 00:09:34.630 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that'll take off any spaces on either end.
Next up, we want validate,

00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:38.450 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and what we want to do is do custom
validation on this email address to make

00:09:38.450 --> 00:09:44.200 line:100% position:50% align:middle
sure that this is a proper validation. The
way that we do that is you pass it an

00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:48.220 line:100% position:50% align:middle
array. The first thing is how to validate
it, and the second thing is the error

00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:52.660 line:100% position:50% align:middle
message if it fails validation. So we have
this package here called "Validator" and

00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:58.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
this is a really good validation package
for Node.js. All we need to do is just

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.990 line:100% position:50% align:middle
take the validator and say, "isEmal" and
that will just make sure that it is a

00:10:02.990 --> 00:10:08.790 line:100% position:50% align:middle
valid email address based on having an @
and all that good stuff inside of it.

00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:14.830 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Then, the second thing is just an error
message. So it's, "Invalid Email Address".

00:10:14.830 --> 00:10:18.530 line:100% position:50% align:middle
If somebody tries to sign up with an
invalid email address, this message is

00:10:18.530 --> 00:10:22.620 line:100% position:50% align:middle
going to show to them. Now, we're also
going to implement client-side checks with

00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:27.940 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the input type equals email. So they
almost will never see this error message,

00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:31.270 line:100% position:50% align:middle
because we'll catch it in the browser. But
if for whatever reason,

00:10:31.270 --> 00:10:34.940 line:100% position:50% align:middle
somebody is on an older browser that
doesn't haven't an input type of email or

00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:39.890 line:100% position:50% align:middle
somebody maliciously turns it off, we need
to make sure that we are also checking on

00:10:39.890 --> 00:10:43.950 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the server side, and that people aren't
signing up with invalid email addresses.

00:10:43.950 --> 00:10:47.520 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Next, we want it to be required, which is
generally true. Or if,

00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:54.900 line:100% position:50% align:middle
for us, we're going to say, "Please supply
an email address." So if someone forgets

00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:58.770 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to sign up and they bypass our client-side
validation, it's going to tell them that.

00:10:58.770 --> 00:11:02.340 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Next up, we have our name. Make sure you
put a comma there, and our name is going

00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:08.640 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to be type of "string", and it's going to
be required as "Please supply a name" and

00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:12.750 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it's going to say, "trim: true". That one
is a lot simpler than the other one.

00:11:12.750 --> 00:11:16.990 line:100% position:50% align:middle
This one has a lot of things to think
about when you have an email address.

00:11:16.990 --> 00:11:22.170 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So now, we're able to create new users
given that they have an email address and

00:11:22.170 --> 00:11:29.233 line:100% position:50% align:middle
a name. Now, you might be asking, "Well,
don't they need a password field?" That's

00:11:29.233 --> 00:11:34.950 line:100% position:50% align:middle
exactly true. We need to be able to store
a password in the database.

00:11:34.950 --> 00:11:37.310 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Or actually, we don't want to store the
password itself. We want to store what's

00:11:37.310 --> 00:11:41.390 line:100% position:50% align:middle
called the "hash" of that password. To do
that, we're going to be using a package

00:11:41.390 --> 00:11:47.870 line:100% position:50% align:middle
called Passport.js. Passport.js is a
middleware for Node.js, and it can be used

00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:53.250 line:100% position:50% align:middle
with any Node.js framework that has
built-in middleware. What it does is,

00:11:53.250 --> 00:11:56.950 line:100% position:50% align:middle
essentially, it takes away a lot of the
heavy lifting that comes along with

00:11:56.950 --> 00:12:02.950 line:100% position:50% align:middle
managing sessions or creating tokens, or
logging people in, logging people out,

00:12:02.950 --> 00:12:06.120 line:100% position:50% align:middle
being able to interface with many of the
popular login providers,

00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:11.040 line:100% position:50% align:middle
like LinkedIn, or Google, or Twitter, or
Facebook. It's just a fantastic...

00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:14.710 line:100% position:50% align:middle
It's like the de facto library that you
use if you need to do any sort of

00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:19.250 line:100% position:50% align:middle
authentication inside of Password.js. It's
sort of like a base framework,

00:12:19.250 --> 00:12:23.690 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and then they have these things called
"Strategies," which allow you to do

00:12:23.690 --> 00:12:28.810 line:100% position:50% align:middle
everything from doing things like
password-auth0 Twitter. You can log in.

00:12:28.810 --> 00:12:32.630 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We're going to use username and password,
which is called a "Local Strategy."

00:12:32.630 --> 00:12:35.900 line:100% position:50% align:middle
There's all kinds of different strategies
that you can have and be implemented in

00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:41.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
here. It's pretty neat and it takes a lot
of the heavy lifting off our plate.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:45.290 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So in order to do that, we're not going to
specify a password or a hash,

00:12:45.290 --> 00:12:50.060 line:100% position:50% align:middle
or anything field in here. We're just
going to be using this Passport Local

00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:55.790 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Mongoose library that we imported, and it
will take care of adding the additional

00:12:55.790 --> 00:13:01.880 line:100% position:50% align:middle
fields to our schema, as well as adding
the additional methods to create our new

00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:05.790 line:100% position:50% align:middle
logins. So we'll go down here, and we'll
take our User Schema,

00:13:05.790 --> 00:13:10.900 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and we're going to just add the plugin
that's called "Passport Local Mongoose".

00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:16.300 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Then, we just need to pass it one option
that says, "usernameField" that's going to

00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:19.960 line:100% position:50% align:middle
be the email field. So essentially what we
say is, "Here's our schema,

00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:24.750 line:100% position:50% align:middle
email name. Can you please add all the
methods and all of the fields that are

00:13:24.750 --> 00:13:30.780 line:100% position:50% align:middle
needed for us to add authentication to our
schema? By the way,

00:13:30.780 --> 00:13:35.420 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I want to use "email" as our login field."
You know, some services allow you to login

00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:39.150 line:100% position:50% align:middle
with a username or they login with an
email address? In this case,

00:13:39.150 --> 00:13:42.410 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we're going to be using the email address
to log the people in.

00:13:42.410 --> 00:13:49.630 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Next up, we also need to use a second
plugin called "MongoDB Error Handler." So

00:13:49.630 --> 00:13:54.280 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"userSchema.plugin" and this is what we
imported right here,

00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:58.810 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"mongodbErrorHandler". Essentially, what
that will do is, this validation,

00:13:58.810 --> 00:14:04.550 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it will give us good errors. But when you
have a unique of "true",

00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:08.460 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it actually doesn't give us very nice
errors. It sort of gives us an ugly error

00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:12.990 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that comes along with MongoDB, and it has
a code in it. It's just not something that

00:14:12.990 --> 00:14:15.870 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you actually want to show to your user. So
by having this plugin,

00:14:15.870 --> 00:14:21.700 line:100% position:50% align:middle
what it will do is it will change those
errors from the ugly error into the nice

00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:24.970 line:100% position:50% align:middle
version [inaudible]. If you're
interested in learning more about this,

00:14:24.970 --> 00:14:29.540 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you just go to Mongoose Error Handler.
Give it a quick search.

00:14:29.540 --> 00:14:36.980 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Look it up on... There we go. So what the
error will say is, "1111000-duplicate

00:14:36.980 --> 00:14:40.980 line:100% position:50% align:middle
key." That's not great for your user to
see. What this will allow us to do is it

00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:46.950 line:100% position:50% align:middle
will give us much nicer error messages in
there. So really happy with that.

00:14:46.950 --> 00:14:51.500 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Other than that, it looks like we are in
pretty good shape. Let's move on to

00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:55.330 line:100% position:50% align:middle
posting our data to our login. Now, this
login form isn't much use to us.

00:14:55.330 --> 00:14:59.590 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We actually need the register form as
well, so that we can use our login form

00:14:59.590 --> 00:15:02.650 line:100% position:50% align:middle
once we're actually registered. So let's
set up our route for that as well.

00:15:02.650 --> 00:15:08.360 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We'll go back to our index.js,
"router.get('/register'," and that's going

00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:12.860 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to be "userController.registerForm)".
Then, we'll go over to our User

00:15:12.860 --> 00:15:19.230 line:100% position:50% align:middle
controller. We'll have
"exports.registerForm" and we're going to

00:15:19.230 --> 00:15:25.360 line:100% position:50% align:middle
just quickly render out the Register file,
and that's going to have a title of

00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:29.600 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"Register". Then, we'll go back to our
views. Make a new file called

00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:35.550 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"register.pug". Extend the layout. Now,
inside of here, we could shell it off to a

00:15:35.550 --> 00:15:38.820 line:100% position:50% align:middle
mixin if we do want our register form to
pop up in multiple places.

00:15:38.820 --> 00:15:42.370 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I'm going to keep in line just for the
sake of not having too many files and

00:15:42.370 --> 00:15:46.300 line:100% position:50% align:middle
confusing you. But totally doable in a
mixin, just as we've done the other one.

00:15:46.300 --> 00:15:51.110 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So I'll just say "form" with class of
"form". The action is going to be "post it

00:15:51.110 --> 00:15:55.980 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to register". Of course, the method is
"POST". Then, inside of that,

00:15:55.980 --> 00:16:01.110 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we'll have "h2 Register". We'll have a
label for our name. [inaudible]

00:16:01.110 --> 00:16:05.220 line:100% position:50% align:middle
an input for our "name" equals "name".
We'll have an input...

00:16:05.220 --> 00:16:09.110 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I always forget to put the words in the
name. There we go. Then,

00:16:09.110 --> 00:16:14.680 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we'll have a label for "email". We'll have
an input type of "email".

00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:19.330 line:100% position:50% align:middle
That's going to tell us that we need it.
That's going to make sure that it is a

00:16:19.330 --> 00:16:24.460 line:100% position:50% align:middle
valid email before we sign up, and the
name is going to be "email" and I'm going

00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:28.260 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to also make it required. Same with the
name. We're going to make that required.

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:31.440 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"Email", then we're going to make two
fields for "password". So say,

00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:38.820 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"label(for="password")", input type,
"password", name equals "password".

00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:41.990 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Then, we'll just duplicate that, and this
is going to be "confirm-password".

00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:50.340 line:100% position:50% align:middle
This is going to be "password-confirm".
Confirm password as text there.

00:16:50.340 --> 00:16:56.520 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Good. Finally, I guess we need a Submit
button as well. Input type of "submit",

00:16:56.520 --> 00:17:02.050 line:100% position:50% align:middle
value equals "register". Good. Give this a
refresh now. Do we have that "register"?

00:17:02.050 --> 00:17:07.010 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Oh, "Failed to lookup 'register' in the
views directory." What did we do wrong?

00:17:07.010 --> 00:17:15.430 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We put a "register", R-E-G-I-S-T-E-R.
"Reigster"? "Regis Philmanster," no.

00:17:15.430 --> 00:17:18.990 line:100% position:50% align:middle
That's not what we want. So we want to go
back to our User controller.

00:17:18.990 --> 00:17:23.960 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We want to register that actual... There
we go. Name, email, password,

00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:30.720 line:100% position:50% align:middle
confirm password, and register. Actually,
we'll pop a class of "button" on our

00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:33.410 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Register button, just so it looks a little
bit nicer. Beautiful.

00:17:33.410 --> 00:17:38.500 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Okay. So we have all of our fields set up,
and it's going to be actually a couple

00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:44.420 line:100% position:50% align:middle
steps once we actually post to /register.
Let's go back to our routes here,

00:17:44.420 --> 00:17:52.130 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and we have our Get Register, be need the
route for when it's posted to Register.

00:17:52.130 --> 00:17:56.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
There's kind of a couple things that need
to happen as soon as we hit that

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:59.680 line:100% position:50% align:middle
registration. First, we need to..and
we'll write this, here.

00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:07.650 line:100% position:50% align:middle
One, we need to validate the registration
data. Two, we need to register the user.

00:18:07.650 --> 00:18:13.380 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Three, we need to log them in, once
they've actually done the registration.

00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:17.260 line:100% position:50% align:middle
First, we actually need to validate the
data that the person is registering with.

00:18:17.260 --> 00:18:21.300 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We try to do as much validation as
possible on our model. But sometimes

00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:26.820 line:100% position:50% align:middle
there's additional checks that need to
happen, before you even start to send the

00:18:26.820 --> 00:18:31.780 line:100% position:50% align:middle
data over to the database. In that case,
you can also do validation right inside of

00:18:31.780 --> 00:18:35.980 line:100% position:50% align:middle
your actual controller. For that, we're
going to go into our User Controller,

00:18:35.980 --> 00:18:39.900 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and we're going to make a middleware,
which is going to do a bunch of checks to

00:18:39.900 --> 00:18:45.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
make sure that we've done everything
correctly. So make a middleware called

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:50.180 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"validateRegister", and that is going to
take a req, res, and the next.

00:18:50.180 --> 00:18:56.770 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We pass "next" because it's going to be
middleware. If everything passes Register,

00:18:56.770 --> 00:19:01.800 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we're just going to pass it along to the
next person in line. So the first thing

00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:06.610 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that we want to do is sanitize their name,
and make sure that they're not trying to

00:19:06.610 --> 00:19:10.200 line:100% position:50% align:middle
sign up with any sort of script tags in
it. So we'll say,

00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:18.240 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"req.sanitizeBody('name')". Now, hold on.
Where did this come from?

00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:22.380 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Is that like an Express thing? Is that
built in? How come I just pulled that out

00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:26.340 line:100% position:50% align:middle
of nowhere and now I'm just using this
function called "sanitizeBody"?

00:19:26.340 --> 00:19:30.040 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Well, if we open up our app.js, remember I
said, "This is a lot of stuff,

00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:35.140 line:100% position:50% align:middle
but we'll come back to this," every single
time that we have? Remember we imported

00:19:35.140 --> 00:19:40.030 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Express-Validator, and then later on we
used it? Where did we use it?

00:19:40.030 --> 00:19:46.900 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Here we go, "app.use(expressValidator())",
what this does is it applies a bunch of

00:19:46.900 --> 00:19:52.850 line:100% position:50% align:middle
validation methods to every single
request. Then, whenever you have a

00:19:52.850 --> 00:19:57.830 line:100% position:50% align:middle
request, you can just call the different
validation methods that live on top of it,

00:19:57.830 --> 00:20:00.830 line:100% position:50% align:middle
without having to import the library or
anything. They're sort of just always

00:20:00.830 --> 00:20:04.540 line:100% position:50% align:middle
there for us. Additionally, it does a
whole bunch of stuff. Let's just take a

00:20:04.540 --> 00:20:08.130 line:100% position:50% align:middle
quick look at the Express-Validator at
GitHub here. What it will do is,

00:20:08.130 --> 00:20:12.170 line:100% position:50% align:middle
whenever you have somebody send data to a
URL, you can check the body,

00:20:12.170 --> 00:20:15.650 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you can check the params, and you can
check the query. So body is things posted

00:20:15.650 --> 00:20:22.280 line:100% position:50% align:middle
via a form. Params are things that come in
the URL. Query are things that come also

00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:26.330 line:100% position:50% align:middle
in the URL, but after that question mark
that you have. So you can check that they

00:20:26.330 --> 00:20:31.230 line:100% position:50% align:middle
all are in the format that you're looking
for, or you can convert them,

00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:34.480 line:100% position:50% align:middle
or you can do some sanitization, whatever
it is that you need to do.

00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:38.190 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So before you actually work with your
data, often, you need to do some

00:20:38.190 --> 00:20:41.260 line:100% position:50% align:middle
sanitizing, a little massaging, a little
bit of working with your data.

00:20:41.260 --> 00:20:46.010 line:100% position:50% align:middle
That's exactly what this does for us. So
we are sanitizing the body,

00:20:46.010 --> 00:20:51.890 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the name. So "req.body.name", it's
sanitizing that property on there.

00:20:51.890 --> 00:20:55.390 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Then, we are going to check that somebody
actually supplied a name,

00:20:55.390 --> 00:20:58.910 line:100% position:50% align:middle
because we make sure that it's required
here, but we're going to also make sure

00:20:58.910 --> 00:21:04.590 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that it's required here. So we'll just
say, "req.checkBody" for a "name" property

00:21:04.590 --> 00:21:12.990 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that "You must supply a name!", and then
you've got to check that it is not empty.

00:21:12.990 --> 00:21:17.950 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Then, we also want to check for the email.
So, "req.checkBody",

00:21:17.950 --> 00:21:25.160 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we're going to check that the "email"
property and, "That email is not valid".

00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:28.210 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Then, you want to say, "isEmail". You see
how we're doing all of our checks?

00:21:28.210 --> 00:21:34.920 line:100% position:50% align:middle
You also could say, ".notEmpty" and
"isEmail". So you chain these on and on.

00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:38.100 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So you can do multiple checks in one go.
In our case, we just need to check for

00:21:38.100 --> 00:21:41.620 line:100% position:50% align:middle
email, because if it is not there it will
fail that test as well.

00:21:41.620 --> 00:21:45.660 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Then, we also want to normalize the email
address. So we'll say,

00:21:45.660 --> 00:21:52.340 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"req.sanitizeBody". I'm going to take the
email. There's a method called

00:21:52.340 --> 00:21:58.330 line:100% position:50% align:middle
".normalizeEmail". What this will do is
there's this thing when you have people

00:21:58.330 --> 00:22:03.340 line:100% position:50% align:middle
sign up to your account, sometimes they'll
use "Wesbos@gmail.com".

00:22:03.340 --> 00:22:08.290 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Sometimes if they're in the UK, they'll
use "wesbos@googlemail.com".

00:22:08.290 --> 00:22:17.430 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Sometimes they'll use "wes.bos@gmail.com",
which is the same thing as Gmail.

00:22:17.430 --> 00:22:23.110 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So Gmail lets you put dots anywhere in
your Gmail one, and that's technically

00:22:23.110 --> 00:22:29.750 line:100% position:50% align:middle
different ones. You can do
"wesbos+test@gmail.com". So there's all

00:22:29.750 --> 00:22:35.080 line:100% position:50% align:middle
these variations on the email, as well as
you can do capitals and what not.

00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:40.230 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So with all these different variations,
what happens is, A, either people can be

00:22:40.230 --> 00:22:44.110 line:100% position:50% align:middle
malicious and sign up for multiple
accounts. I don't do that, because I know

00:22:44.110 --> 00:22:50.410 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that people use this for very good
reasons. But also, people just forget what

00:22:50.410 --> 00:22:54.250 line:100% position:50% align:middle
email address they possibly used. So a lot
of times, people are using these modifiers

00:22:54.250 --> 00:22:57.220 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to sign up for my website, and then they
email me being like, "Hey,

00:22:57.220 --> 00:23:02.010 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Wes. I forgot which email address I used
to sign up. Can you tell me?" So what you

00:23:02.010 --> 00:23:06.220 line:100% position:50% align:middle
can do is you can allow people to sign up
with any of these email addresses,

00:23:06.220 --> 00:23:12.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and this normalizeEmail function is just
going to always normalize it down to

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:16.590 line:100% position:50% align:middle
simply "wesbos@gmail.com". You can turn
all of these different features on and

00:23:16.590 --> 00:23:21.360 line:100% position:50% align:middle
off. Different email providers, some Yahoo
and some Microsoft ones have similar

00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:25.410 line:100% position:50% align:middle
quirks about them. But it just starts to
cut down either on abuse,

00:23:25.410 --> 00:23:29.970 line:100% position:50% align:middle
or just general confusion and angry users.
So we're going to go into our

00:23:29.970 --> 00:23:33.230 line:100% position:50% align:middle
normalizeEmail here. There's a couple of
properties that we want to say,

00:23:33.230 --> 00:23:38.480 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"remove_dots", and that will be "false",
just because sometimes you do want to have

00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:44.150 line:100% position:50% align:middle
multiple email addresses for the same
service. So that is allowed to do that.

00:23:44.150 --> 00:23:48.510 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We're going to say, "remove_extension",
because dots and extension by default are

00:23:48.510 --> 00:23:56.340 line:100% position:50% align:middle
on by "true". So we say,
"remove_extension: false", and then,

00:23:56.340 --> 00:24:00.320 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"gmail_remove_subaddress" and that is also
going to be "false".

00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:04.310 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So if you want to know what all these
possible ones are, all you have to do is

00:24:04.310 --> 00:24:09.700 line:100% position:50% align:middle
go to Express-Validator, look for this
normalizeEmail function here...

00:24:09.700 --> 00:24:15.240 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Actually, if you do not find it, it's
because you have to just go to Validator,

00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:19.910 line:100% position:50% align:middle
because Express-Validator just sits on top
of this Validator package that we were

00:24:19.910 --> 00:24:23.420 line:100% position:50% align:middle
using earlier, and there we go,
"normalizeEmail" all lowercase,

00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:27.320 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"gmail lowercase", "gmail_remove_dots",
"gmail_remove_subaddress",

00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:29.340 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"outlook". There's all kinds of stuff that
will normalizeEmail,

00:24:29.340 --> 00:24:33.080 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and you make sure that you have those
turned on and off, depending on what your

00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:36.280 line:100% position:50% align:middle
preferences are for your application. So
we're sanitizing the body there.

00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:40.440 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Next up, we want to check that the
password cannot be blank, "req.checkBody",

00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:44.690 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and we're going to check that the
password... I'll say, "password cannot be

00:24:44.690 --> 00:24:50.460 line:100% position:50% align:middle
blank," "notEmpty". Again, these probably
won't ever trip. But if somebody does turn

00:24:50.460 --> 00:24:53.740 line:100% position:50% align:middle
off the actual validation right here...
Because if I try to submit this,

00:24:53.740 --> 00:24:59.080 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you see how it's triggering the HTML5 one?
But somebody could easily come along and

00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:02.870 line:100% position:50% align:middle
take the required attribute off of these
fields, and then submit it.

00:25:02.870 --> 00:25:05.760 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we do need to make sure that we're
doing a server-side check.

00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:13.560 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We'll check the body again that the
password-confirm is also not blank,

00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:20.670 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"Confirmed Password cannot be blank!"
Empty." Then, we want to check that they

00:25:20.670 --> 00:25:25.280 line:100% position:50% align:middle
are the same. So,
"req.checkBody('password-confirm',".

00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:31.750 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"Oops! Your passwords do not match')".
Then, we're going to say,

00:25:31.750 --> 00:25:34.660 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"equals". So we want to make sure that the
password confirmed is equal to

00:25:34.660 --> 00:25:41.800 line:100% position:50% align:middle
req.body.password. Right? So woo. That's a
lot of checks that we have in place there.

00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:46.520 line:100% position:50% align:middle
But it's the simplest way to do validation
with Express-Validator.

00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:49.430 line:100% position:50% align:middle
You just build a nice, little middleware
that will take care of it.

00:25:49.430 --> 00:25:53.220 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Then, by the time we actually get to
registering, we know that all the data is

00:25:53.220 --> 00:25:57.320 line:100% position:50% align:middle
going to be super, super-clean. Now, what
we've got to do is we've got to get those

00:25:57.320 --> 00:26:01.540 line:100% position:50% align:middle
validation errors. So I'll say, "const
errors = req.validationErrors()".

00:26:01.540 --> 00:26:02.750 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Calling this method, it will actually
check all of these methods here,

00:26:02.750 --> 00:26:05.550 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and put them into an Errors object. Then,
we can just simply check,

00:26:05.550 --> 00:26:10.670 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"If there are errors then," and in this
case we're not going to pass it on to any

00:26:10.670 --> 00:26:17.830 line:100% position:50% align:middle
sort of error-handling middleware. We
actually want to handle the error

00:26:17.830 --> 00:26:21.550 line:100% position:50% align:middle
ourselves here. This is a good example of
actually handling the error yourself,

00:26:21.550 --> 00:26:31.250 line:100% position:50% align:middle
rather than passing it along to any sort
of middleware. So if that is true,

00:26:31.250 --> 00:26:37.370 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we'll say, "req.flash('error',". So we'll
say, "errors.map". We'll take the error,

00:26:37.370 --> 00:26:44.890 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and we'll return the error.msg. What this
will do is that the errors here will

00:26:44.890 --> 00:26:49.370 line:100% position:50% align:middle
contain an array of objects, including the
error message, as well as which field

00:26:49.370 --> 00:26:53.140 line:100% position:50% align:middle
actually had an error. So you could also
use this to highlight which fields has an

00:26:53.140 --> 00:26:56.490 line:100% position:50% align:middle
error. But in our case, we're not all that
concerned. Then, finally,

00:26:56.490 --> 00:27:00.810 line:100% position:50% align:middle
if something went wrong, what should we
do? Well, we should just go back and

00:27:00.810 --> 00:27:05.260 line:100% position:50% align:middle
re-render this register form. But we don't
want to totally clear the form.

00:27:05.260 --> 00:27:09.590 line:100% position:50% align:middle
How much do you hate that, when you go to
a website and you have a validation error,

00:27:09.590 --> 00:27:13.430 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and then it just totally clears your
entire form? That's not something that we

00:27:13.430 --> 00:27:19.550 line:100% position:50% align:middle
want to do to our users. So say,
"res.render('register'," and the title is

00:27:19.550 --> 00:27:24.450 line:100% position:50% align:middle
going to be "Register". The body is going
to be "req.body". Right?

00:27:24.450 --> 00:27:27.240 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We're going to take the body and just send
it right back to the user,

00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:32.270 line:100% position:50% align:middle
so that we can prepopulate these inputs
once more. Then, we also need to send the

00:27:32.270 --> 00:27:37.750 line:100% position:50% align:middle
flashes along. The reason why is because,
normally the flashes get passed along

00:27:37.750 --> 00:27:41.210 line:100% position:50% align:middle
because it's on the next request. But
because all of this validation and

00:27:41.210 --> 00:27:45.490 line:100% position:50% align:middle
rendering, the re-register is happening on
one single request,

00:27:45.490 --> 00:27:50.130 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we need to explicitly pass the flashes,
which looks like this,

00:27:50.130 --> 00:27:56.450 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"req.flash". So if you ever need them on
that request, you can just manually pass

00:27:56.450 --> 00:28:00.880 line:100% position:50% align:middle
them like that. Otherwise, the next time
they come around, they'll be passed to

00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:07.050 line:100% position:50% align:middle
your locals, no problem. I forgot an arrow
here, and we'll pop a semicolon here,

00:28:07.050 --> 00:28:12.100 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and let's actually hook up this
validateRegister method to our router.

00:28:12.100 --> 00:28:17.500 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Go back to index.js. Say, "When somebody
posts to /register, the first thing we're

00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:21.360 line:100% position:50% align:middle
going to do is
userController.validateRegister." So

00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:25.420 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that's really, "Let's actually make it
break," and then we'll go back to our

00:28:25.420 --> 00:28:30.300 line:100% position:50% align:middle
register.pug and make sure that you take
off these requires, just temporarily,

00:28:30.300 --> 00:28:34.480 line:100% position:50% align:middle
so we can actually make it break and see
what will happen. So let's go back here.

00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:38.740 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We'll go to our Register page. Name, I'm
going to do nothing and push Register.

00:28:38.740 --> 00:28:44.770 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Oh, I get an error, "req.validationErrors
is not a function." So one more time,

00:28:44.770 --> 00:28:52.340 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we'll go back here. Too many R's and this
needs an S. There we go.

00:28:52.340 --> 00:28:55.570 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"You must apply a name!", "That email is
not valid", "Passwords cannot be blank",

00:28:55.570 --> 00:29:00.780 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and "Confirmed passwords cannot be blank!"
Wow. So see? We did all the bad things and

00:29:00.780 --> 00:29:05.180 line:100% position:50% align:middle
now it's telling us what these possible
errors are. If I filled in some of them,

00:29:05.180 --> 00:29:10.930 line:100% position:50% align:middle
like "wes" and "wesbos@gmail.com", but I
did this as "wes" and this as "bos"...

00:29:10.930 --> 00:29:14.930 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Oh, what did we do there? We didn't do a
type of "password" on that.

00:29:14.930 --> 00:29:19.400 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Let's take a look. Oh, type of "password",
and then name of "password-confirm".

00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:25.730 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I was being a hotshot with my selectors
there earlier. So once we now submit this,

00:29:25.730 --> 00:29:29.370 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it says, "Oops! Your passwords do not
match". Why? Because the password-confirm

00:29:29.370 --> 00:29:33.780 line:100% position:50% align:middle
was not equal to the actual password. So
that is a first part of our middleware,

00:29:33.780 --> 00:29:40.560 line:100% position:50% align:middle
where we validate all other registration
data. I should say the last thing is down

00:29:40.560 --> 00:29:46.100 line:100% position:50% align:middle
here, if there is errors you've returned,
which will stop the function from running.

00:29:46.100 --> 00:29:52.020 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Otherwise, we're just going to call "next"
and say, "There were no errors." What

00:29:52.020 --> 00:29:55.510 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"next" will do is it will just call the
next piece of middleware down the line.

00:29:55.510 --> 00:29:59.600 line:100% position:50% align:middle
That is actually, "Now, let's register
them. Let's save them to the database."

00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:03.110 line:100% position:50% align:middle
That's exactly what we're going
to do in the next video.

00:30:03.110 --> 00:30:06.200 line:100% position:50% align:middle
