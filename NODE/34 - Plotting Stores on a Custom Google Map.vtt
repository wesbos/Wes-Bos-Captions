00:00:11.741 --> 00:00:13.968 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Let's click on our map page.
And, of course,

00:00:13.968 --> 00:00:17.030 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we're going to get a 404. So let's
make a quick route for it,

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:20.930 line:100% position:50% align:middle
then we'll make a PUG file, then we'll get
into actually creating our JavaScript.

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:25.360 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we'll go to index.js, we'll go to the
bottom here, and we will create a route.

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:29.780 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I'm going to do it above our API stuff.
Say "router.get". And when that happens,

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:33.700 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we are going to use our storeController
and we're going to go to the mapPage.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:42.210 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Good. Now open up our storeController.js
and we'll make our mapPage method here.

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:49.200 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And it's going to res.render out map.
And the title is going to be Map.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:55.973 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Good. And then finally we will go into our
views folder and create a map.pug file.

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:04.220 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And we got our map page showing up. Good.
So on this page we need just very minimal

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:09.210 line:100% position:50% align:middle
markup because most of the stuff is going
to be happening in our maps JavaScript.

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:15.960 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we need an inner div inside of here.
Inside of that we'll have our h2.

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:22.130 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We'll have a map div with a class of .map
div. We'll have an .autocomplete.

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:26.701 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Inside of that we're going to have an
input with a class of autocomplete__input.

00:01:29.459 --> 00:01:36.230 line:100% position:50% align:middle
It's going to have a type of text.
Placeholder of "Search for Anything."

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:40.620 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And then name of geolocate, that's the
most important part because that's how

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:44.160 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we're going to actually select our input.
Then as a sibling to autocomplete,

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:48.880 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we need a div with an ID of map, and
inside of that just put a paragraph tag

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.760 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"Loading Map..." Good, so that's all of
the PUG file we need to write,

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:57.980 line:100% position:50% align:middle
so we can close that down. And we can also
close down our controller.

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:01.700 line:100% position:50% align:middle
What we need to now do is write the
client-side JavaScript. So we're going to

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:07.640 line:100% position:50% align:middle
go into our public folder, into our
modules, and we're going to make a map.js

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.780 line:100% position:50% align:middle
file. Then in here we're going to import
axios, which is a nice library for

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:18.250 line:100% position:50% align:middle
fetching AJAX again. And we're going to
make a function called loadPlaces that

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:28.530 line:100% position:50% align:middle
takes in a map, a lat, and a long. And
we're going to default the lat to being

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:34.740 line:100% position:50% align:middle
43.2. And the long is going to be
defaulted to -79.8. And you could

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:37.240 line:100% position:50% align:middle
automatically detect that
from the user using

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:46.320 line:100% position:50% align:middle
navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition.
And I have a tutorial on how to do that on

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:50.710 line:100% position:50% align:middle
javascript30.com. So if you are interested
on how to make that dynamic rather than

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:57.180 line:100% position:50% align:middle
fall back to a default here, go and take
the day... Here we go,

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:01.980 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Geolocation, Hardware Access. Go and take
day 21 of JavaScript 30 and you'll know

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:06.680 line:100% position:50% align:middle
exactly how to do that. So remove that
there. Then we also need another function

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:12.570 line:100% position:50% align:middle
from this loadPlaces called makeMap.
Function makeMap. It takes the name

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:22.410 line:100% position:50% align:middle
mapDiv. And then finally from that we are
going to export default makeMap.

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:26.240 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Good. So we import axios, we have a
function called loadPlaces,

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:30.170 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we have a function called makeMap, and
then we export just the makeMap.

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:35.530 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Let's open up our delicious-app.js and
import the makeMap function.

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:42.890 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And we'll go ahead and use it, makeMap,
and we're going to use the bling.js to

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:50.600 line:100% position:50% align:middle
give it an ID of map. All right, so we
have everything up and running.

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:55.730 line:100% position:50% align:middle
If we just go into this makeMap, we're
going to console.log the mapDiv.

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:02.770 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Go in here and see what we got. Oh,
"Cannot find module". What did I do?

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:09.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Come on now. There we go. There we go, we
have our mapDiv showing up on this page.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.620 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now if I were to go to my home page, it
will say "null". Why? Because it doesn't

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:17.680 line:100% position:50% align:middle
actually find anything on that page. So we
can go into our makeMap and say,

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:22.880 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"If there is no mapDiv, return." Right?
And then that function will not run on

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:29.540 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that specific page. Good. So if we look at
our layout.js and go to the bottom.

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:32.090 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We've already looked at this a couple
times, but let's look at it again.

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:37.150 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I have already loaded in the Google Maps
JavaScript library for us,

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:41.340 line:100% position:50% align:middle
so we don't need to load any of that in.
We can actually just start to go ahead and

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:46.530 line:100% position:50% align:middle
make our map. So we'll go back to our map
page here and we're going to just get a

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:50.930 line:100% position:50% align:middle
map on the page, and then worry about how
do we load in the actual data.

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:55.140 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So in order to do that we need some map
options, some I'm going to put this above

00:04:55.140 --> 00:05:02.180 line:100% position:50% align:middle
here. Say "const mapOptions =", and you
give it an object. It needs a center.

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:11.511 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Again, it's going to have a lat that is
equal to 43.2. And an L-N-G which is -79.8

00:05:11.511 --> 00:05:17.690 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And we're going to set a zoom level
of two, and that's just how far in should

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:20.630 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it be zoomed in. If you want to look at
all the different options,

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:25.180 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you can take a quick look at the docs for
Google Maps. Then we'll go in here and

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:29.420 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we'll actually make our map. So a little
comment "make our map."

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:33.950 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Then we're going to store it in a variable
because we're going to need reference to

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:41.840 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that map fairly often. So "const map = new
google.maps. Map," capital M-A-P.

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:47.360 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And then you pass it two things. First,
where should it go, mapDiv.

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:51.420 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Remember, we passed in this mapDiv, which
is a div with the ID of map.

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:56.010 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And then the second thing that we're
passing in is an object of options,

00:05:56.010 --> 00:06:03.540 line:100% position:50% align:middle
mapOptions. Good. I think now if we
refresh our actual page we should see a

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:07.640 line:100% position:50% align:middle
map showing up. There we go, that's a nice
little map showing up.

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:11.730 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Zoom two, probably that's not a good idea,
maybe eight. What does eight give us?

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:15.980 line:100% position:50% align:middle
There we go, that's a little bit better
zoomed in. But we have our map up and

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:21.490 line:100% position:50% align:middle
running. Next thing that we need to do is
to hook up this geolocation here.

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:24.580 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Right? Because we did this on the other
page, but this is a different one

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:29.740 line:100% position:50% align:middle
altogether. So what we'll do is we'll grab
that input. We'll say "const input,"

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:34.070 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and we'll quickly get that right off the
page with our bling.js.

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:38.340 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Actually, we don't have our bling.js.
Remember this one? The dollar sign is just

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:44.700 line:100% position:50% align:middle
a nice shortcut to document.querySelector.
So what you can do is import dollar sign

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:54.910 line:100% position:50% align:middle
from bling. And then we can use it. So we
want to get something that has a name of

00:06:54.910 --> 00:06:59.970 line:100% position:50% align:middle
geolocate. Let's just console.log the
input to make sure that we know what we're

00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:02.720 line:100% position:50% align:middle
dealing with and that our selectors are
working fine. So if I refresh,

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:07.200 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I should see actual input. Good. That's
this input right here,

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:11.460 line:100% position:50% align:middle
geolocate. And then we're going to make it
autocomplete just like we did before.

00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:20.120 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we say "const autocomplete = new
google.maps.places. Autocomplete."

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:25.400 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And you pass it the actual input that
you're looking for. Good.

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:28.960 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now if I give that a save, we should see a
bunch of drop-down.

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:32.330 line:100% position:50% align:middle
There we go. Arizona, Australia. And I'll
hit enter. It doesn't do anything yet,

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:36.380 line:100% position:50% align:middle
but we have that autocomplete working.
We'll come back to that once we have this

00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:42.770 line:100% position:50% align:middle
map up and running. Now we're going to go
over to this loadPlaces here because once

00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:48.100 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we actually have our map, we are going to
run loadPlaces and we're going to pass it

00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:53.370 line:100% position:50% align:middle
our map. And then when somebody changes
the autocomplete, we are also going to run

00:07:53.370 --> 00:07:57.860 line:100% position:50% align:middle
loadPlaces. But let's not get too excited
now, let's work on this part right here.

00:07:57.860 --> 00:08:03.010 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So when the page loads, we are going to
run makeMap, and that will create a map on

00:08:03.010 --> 00:08:08.380 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the page. And when the page map is done
being created, we will run this loadPlaces

00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:14.910 line:100% position:50% align:middle
function, which asks for that specific
map, as well as needs a specific lat and

00:08:14.910 --> 00:08:19.120 line:100% position:50% align:middle
long. And that's going to hit our endpoint
and that's how we're going to search

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:24.730 line:100% position:50% align:middle
inside of it. So what we do here is we are
going to say "axios.get."

00:08:24.730 --> 00:08:30.070 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And we're going to use our API with
backticks. "/api/stores/near."

00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:35.780 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And we need to pass it a lat property,
which is just going to be our lat that

00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:39.730 line:100% position:50% align:middle
gets passed into the function. And we need
to pass it a long property,

00:08:39.730 --> 00:08:44.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
which is going to be our long that was
passed into the function.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:50.220 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Then we have a response from the...
Actually, I think I used R-E-S in the

00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:55.580 line:100% position:50% align:middle
other one. Let's keep it consistent, Wes.
And from that we say "const places =

00:08:55.580 --> 00:09:04.020 line:100% position:50% align:middle
response.data." And let's just console.log
the places. So page loads.

00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:11.430 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Oh, "Response is not defined." Because
it's res. There we go. On page load what

00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:15.910 line:100% position:50% align:middle
happens? We make a map, we run loadPlaces,
loadPlaces will take the default of this

00:09:15.910 --> 00:09:19.250 line:100% position:50% align:middle
lat and long, and we open that up. And
because I have a whole bunch of places in

00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:24.600 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Hamilton, you'll see that this is the data
that's coming back from our API,

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:28.590 line:100% position:50% align:middle
right? We're hitting our own API and
bringing back the data. Good.

00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:36.140 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I'm really happy with that. Now what we do
that we have this data is we need to first

00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:41.320 line:100% position:50% align:middle
check if there are any places. So we'll
say, "If there are no places.length,

00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:44.580 line:100% position:50% align:middle
then..." And in this case you can make
some sort of interface.

00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:49.750 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We'll cheap out and just say "alert'no
places found!'." But what you could do is

00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:54.270 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you could pop a little warning message on
the top here, whatever it is that you like

00:09:54.270 --> 00:09:58.060 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to do, and then it we'll return from this
function because there's nothing else for

00:09:58.060 --> 00:10:04.280 line:100% position:50% align:middle
us to actually do. Then what we want to do
is make a whole bunch of markers.

00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:08.350 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we'll say "const markers =." Markers
are those little red pins that you see on

00:10:08.350 --> 00:10:12.840 line:100% position:50% align:middle
maps all over the place. We'll take our
places array and we'll map over each one

00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:19.030 line:100% position:50% align:middle
of those places and return a marker from
each of them. So we have our place,

00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:30.580 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and then we need to grab the lat and the
long. Const placeLng and placeLat.

00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:34.480 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Notice how we're doing it long, lat here.
Why? Because the data that comes back from

00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:42.760 line:100% position:50% align:middle
our database is long, lat, not lat, long.
And place.location.coordinates.

00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:47.740 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And why is that? Well, place is going to
be one of these Object. .location,

00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:51.620 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that's going to be a sub-object on that
place. And then inside of that we're going

00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:56.020 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to have coordinates, which itself is an
array. The first thing being the long,

00:10:56.020 --> 00:10:59.500 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the second thing being the lat. So what
we're doing is we're using destructuring,

00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:05.240 line:100% position:50% align:middle
array destructuring, here saying, "Make a
variable called placeLng out of the first

00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:09.580 line:100% position:50% align:middle
thing and make a variable called placeLat
out of the second thing." And we could

00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:19.270 line:100% position:50% align:middle
just console.log placeLng and placeLat and
watch this. Whoa. Well,

00:11:19.270 --> 00:11:21.840 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that's good, we get our lat and our long,
or our long and our lat,

00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:26.110 line:100% position:50% align:middle
for every single place that we have. So
good, we know that this loop is actually

00:11:26.110 --> 00:11:30.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
starting to work. Then we need to make a
position object for Google Maps.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:37.580 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we'll say "const position =". Not
"relative", it's equal to an object,

00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:44.090 line:100% position:50% align:middle
where the lat is the placeLat and the long
is the placeLng. Good.

00:11:44.090 --> 00:11:52.520 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Then we can make our actual marker. So
we'll say "const marker = new google.maps.

00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:59.900 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Marker." And that will take an object,
which needs a couple things.

00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:06.290 line:100% position:50% align:middle
The map is going to be our mapDiv, so we
can just do that. And position is going to

00:12:06.290 --> 00:12:14.030 line:100% position:50% align:middle
be our position. Again, if you have
map-map, position-position,

00:12:14.030 --> 00:12:20.040 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we only need to do it once. And we can
just bring those onto their own line just

00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:26.490 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to keep ourself sane. So we made a marker
here, and then what we need to do is also

00:12:26.490 --> 00:12:30.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
attach the place data to that marker.
Because what is the place?

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.430 line:100% position:50% align:middle
The place is the object with all the data
from our API, and I want to attach that

00:12:34.430 --> 00:12:38.470 line:100% position:50% align:middle
data to the marker. Because when somebody
clicks the marker, we need some way to

00:12:38.470 --> 00:12:42.970 line:100% position:50% align:middle
reference that actual place data. So we'll
say marker.place is equal to our place

00:12:42.970 --> 00:12:47.060 line:100% position:50% align:middle
variable, which is going to be this.
Right? That's the individual place that

00:12:47.060 --> 00:12:50.840 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we're going to store on the marker so we
have access to it. And then finally,

00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:55.610 line:100% position:50% align:middle
finally, finally we are going to return
the actual marker from that.

00:12:55.610 --> 00:13:03.550 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So if I were to console.log the markers,
you'll see that I get a couple things

00:13:03.550 --> 00:13:08.220 line:100% position:50% align:middle
here. Awesome. First, the markers actually
show up on our map here.

00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:14.380 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And why is that? Well, because we have
created all of these markers.

00:13:14.380 --> 00:13:19.970 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And we said put it on our map, which is
this map on our page. And put it at this

00:13:19.970 --> 00:13:24.650 line:100% position:50% align:middle
position, which is this object that we
just made. And then we return those

00:13:24.650 --> 00:13:28.690 line:100% position:50% align:middle
markers into an array. And you can see
here that we have a huge array of possible

00:13:28.690 --> 00:13:32.170 line:100% position:50% align:middle
markers. And there's a whole bunch of
information that we can use for handling

00:13:32.170 --> 00:13:35.710 line:100% position:50% align:middle
clicks and whatnot, but what's most
important is that each of these markers

00:13:35.710 --> 00:13:40.040 line:100% position:50% align:middle
has a place object. And if you open that
up, you'll see that this is just the

00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:44.550 line:100% position:50% align:middle
object that actually came from our API.
See? Donut Monster has a location,

00:13:44.550 --> 00:13:48.720 line:100% position:50% align:middle
has a slug, has a name, has an ID. So all
of that information that we need about the

00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:52.880 line:100% position:50% align:middle
place is specifically there. So good. We
don't need to console.log the markers just

00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:58.110 line:100% position:50% align:middle
yet. But there is one problem that we're
having here, and that is this zoom level.

00:13:58.110 --> 00:14:03.210 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I don't know, I could say maybe zoom two
here, and then refresh.

00:14:03.210 --> 00:14:05.540 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Although that's way zoomed out. So maybe
like, what, is zoom 13,

00:14:05.540 --> 00:14:10.350 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I think, as high as you can go? That's way
too zoomed in and it didn't actually

00:14:10.350 --> 00:14:14.600 line:100% position:50% align:middle
center it. So rather than trying to monkey
around and guess with the zoom level,

00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:19.960 line:100% position:50% align:middle
what we can do is we can actually use
something call bounds which will detect,

00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:25.040 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"Okay, this is where all the markers are.
Let's just zoom in so that all of the

00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:29.860 line:100% position:50% align:middle
markers fit, but we are zoomed in as far
as we can possibly go." So what we're

00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:36.370 line:100% position:50% align:middle
going to do is right above creating our
markers we're going to create a bounds.

00:14:36.370 --> 00:14:41.070 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And then I'll show you how that works.
We'll say "const bounds = new google.maps.

00:14:41.070 --> 00:14:48.890 line:100% position:50% align:middle
LatLngBounds". And bounds is something
that we're going to take and extend for

00:14:48.890 --> 00:14:54.930 line:100% position:50% align:middle
every single marker. Then when we loop
over each of these places,

00:14:54.930 --> 00:15:00.770 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we're also going to extend our bounds so
that it will fit each of these markers.

00:15:00.770 --> 00:15:04.690 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So right before we make our marker we're
going to go here and we're going to say

00:15:04.690 --> 00:15:11.570 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"bounds.extend" and we're going to pass it
our position object.

00:15:11.570 --> 00:15:15.310 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So it's going to say, "Hey." All of a
sudden we start with just a pinpoint.

00:15:15.310 --> 00:15:19.350 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And then it says, "Okay, this marker right
here is on Wellington Street,

00:15:19.350 --> 00:15:23.950 line:100% position:50% align:middle
so make sure that we extend our bounds to
include that." And then it is a little bit

00:15:23.950 --> 00:15:27.490 line:100% position:50% align:middle
bigger, the bounds. And then it says, "Oh,
now there's one over here near Gibson,

00:15:27.490 --> 00:15:30.240 line:100% position:50% align:middle
let's extend our bounds to be at least
that big." And then it finds another one

00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:33.570 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to the left here and says, "Oh, there's
one over here," and it will extend the

00:15:33.570 --> 00:15:37.020 line:100% position:50% align:middle
bounds. And what that will do is it will,
at the end of the day once it loops

00:15:37.020 --> 00:15:40.450 line:100% position:50% align:middle
through every single marker, it will give
us a perfect square,

00:15:40.450 --> 00:15:47.070 line:100% position:50% align:middle
or a perfect rectangle, around all of the
markers. And then we can then use that to

00:15:47.070 --> 00:15:51.720 line:100% position:50% align:middle
zoom in or zoom out our map so that
everything fits perfectly.

00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:56.790 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So let's just double-check that everything
is working. Give it a refresh.

00:15:56.790 --> 00:16:03.040 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"gogole," it's "google.maps.
LatLngBounds". Refresh. Everything is

00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:08.230 line:100% position:50% align:middle
showing up. So we have this bounds value
right here. What we want to do is after we

00:16:08.230 --> 00:16:16.170 line:100% position:50% align:middle
loop over all of our markers, we want to
then zoom the map to fit all the markers

00:16:16.170 --> 00:16:22.040 line:100% position:50% align:middle
perfectly. So we'll take our map and we'll
call .setCenter on it.

00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:25.300 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And where are we going to set the center?
Well, we take our bounds and we call

00:16:25.300 --> 00:16:29.970 line:100% position:50% align:middle
getCenter from it. And the bounds, again,
is like a circle or a square around all of

00:16:29.970 --> 00:16:33.610 line:100% position:50% align:middle
our pins and it will tell us where the
actual center of it is.

00:16:33.610 --> 00:16:40.200 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Then I want to refresh. You'll see that on
page load it moves a little bit.

00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:43.160 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And that's because as soon as these
markers are loaded, it will perfectly

00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:46.800 line:100% position:50% align:middle
center those markers in the middle of the
map. Now that's not good enough because

00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:50.810 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I'm zoomed way out here. Ideally I would
be zoomed in something like this,

00:16:50.810 --> 00:16:55.910 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that would show me where they all are. So
that's what we do, we say "map.fitBounds"

00:16:55.910 --> 00:17:02.100 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and you just pass it our actual bounds
here. Now when we refresh,

00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:05.710 line:100% position:50% align:middle
hey, hey, look. You see how it was zoomed
out at first? And then immediately once

00:17:05.710 --> 00:17:10.570 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the data is loaded, it will zoom ourselves
on in to make sure that everything has

00:17:10.570 --> 00:17:15.730 line:100% position:50% align:middle
been fit properly. Good, so we got a
couple of other pieces here with our map,

00:17:15.730 --> 00:17:21.140 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we got everything showing. But when I
click on these, there's no actual data

00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:25.730 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that's showing up. And when you have a
pop-up in Google Maps, that's something

00:17:25.730 --> 00:17:29.670 line:100% position:50% align:middle
called an info window. Google Maps is all
about making just different pieces of the

00:17:29.670 --> 00:17:35.410 line:100% position:50% align:middle
map. Like we have our autocomplete, we
have our markers, we have our map,

00:17:35.410 --> 00:17:40.010 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and now we're going to make a fourth,
fifth thing called an info window.

00:17:40.010 --> 00:17:45.200 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So let's go ahead and make one info window
variable. We'll put it right below our

00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:49.430 line:100% position:50% align:middle
bounds here so we can keep those things
together. So "const infoWindow =,"

00:17:49.430 --> 00:17:56.420 line:100% position:50% align:middle
guess what, "new google.maps. InfoWindow."
We don't need to pass any options to our

00:17:56.420 --> 00:18:01.610 line:100% position:50% align:middle
info window just yet because those options
will be coming once we actually want to

00:18:01.610 --> 00:18:06.980 line:100% position:50% align:middle
click on them. Good. Now let's go right
down below these markers,

00:18:06.980 --> 00:18:11.620 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we have this array of markers. And now
what I want to do is I want to loop over

00:18:11.620 --> 00:18:16.770 line:100% position:50% align:middle
each of those markers and attach an event
listener so that when somebody clicks on

00:18:16.770 --> 00:18:21.120 line:100% position:50% align:middle
one of these markers, we can actually show
that info window. So we'll go right here

00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:27.740 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and we'll say, "When someone clicks on a
marker, show the details of that place."

00:18:27.740 --> 00:18:32.730 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we'll take our markers array and we
will loop over each one with .forEach,

00:18:32.730 --> 00:18:36.680 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we'll have each marker. And what we're
going to do is we're going to take that

00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:42.360 line:100% position:50% align:middle
marker and we're going to call
addListener. Again, addListener is the

00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:45.130 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Google Maps equivalent of
addEventListener. We're going to listen

00:18:45.130 --> 00:18:48.330 line:100% position:50% align:middle
for a click. And when that happens, we're
going to run a function,

00:18:48.330 --> 00:18:53.400 line:100% position:50% align:middle
proper function here. Why? Because if you
console.log this when you click on a

00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:59.670 line:100% position:50% align:middle
marker, let's see what we're working with
here. So let me click on a marker.

00:18:59.670 --> 00:19:04.140 line:100% position:50% align:middle
This is the actual marker itself and
there's all kinds of information about

00:19:04.140 --> 00:19:10.030 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that marker, like what map it is on, what
position, if it's visible or not,

00:19:10.030 --> 00:19:13.930 line:100% position:50% align:middle
if it's clickable. But what we're
concerned with here is this called place.

00:19:13.930 --> 00:19:17.620 line:100% position:50% align:middle
If you open up place, look at it.
"Counter-server joint with an

00:19:17.620 --> 00:19:20.820 line:100% position:50% align:middle
ever-changing selection of elevated soups
and burgers," right?

00:19:20.820 --> 00:19:26.810 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And then you click on another one and it's
going to tell us that this .place is equal

00:19:26.810 --> 00:19:29.430 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to "High end French restaurant on the
hippest street in town." Okay,

00:19:29.430 --> 00:19:36.570 line:100% position:50% align:middle
cool. So we can get the place with this
.place, but we need to create some

00:19:36.570 --> 00:19:41.190 line:100% position:50% align:middle
information, we need to create some HTML
so we can actually set the info window on

00:19:41.190 --> 00:19:48.100 line:100% position:50% align:middle
there. So let's try it with this right
now. We'll say "infoWindow.setContent".

00:19:48.100 --> 00:19:56.150 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And let's just say "this.place.name." And
then we'll say "infoWindow.open,"

00:19:56.150 --> 00:19:59.720 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and you tell it where do I want it to
open. Well, you want to open it on the

00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:04.290 line:100% position:50% align:middle
map. Right? Because you could have
multiple maps on your page and you could

00:20:04.290 --> 00:20:07.980 line:100% position:50% align:middle
have one info window going from map to map
to map. In our case we just will want to

00:20:07.980 --> 00:20:11.320 line:100% position:50% align:middle
put it on our single map. And then where
do we want it to go? Well,

00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:17.160 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you can just pass it a marker, which is
either "this" or "marker."

00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:20.180 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Right? Because if you pass it "this," it's
going to know, "Oh,

00:20:20.180 --> 00:20:25.580 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I should pop up this little info window on
top of this, on top of the marker." You'll

00:20:25.580 --> 00:20:32.510 line:100% position:50% align:middle
see how that works. Sour on King, The
French. You see that they automatically

00:20:32.510 --> 00:20:36.300 line:100% position:50% align:middle
close themselves because there's only one
info window. And if you ask the info

00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:40.640 line:100% position:50% align:middle
window to open somewhere else, it's smart
enough to know to close the other one.

00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:44.690 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So that's really nice, but we can go a
little bit further and create some HTML

00:20:44.690 --> 00:20:51.270 line:100% position:50% align:middle
for each of those. So we'll say "const
html =," backticks. And inside of that

00:20:51.270 --> 00:21:03.330 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we'll have a .popup div with a link to the
store, "/${this.place.slug}."

00:21:03.330 --> 00:21:10.200 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Inside of that we'll give ourselves an
image tag which will go to uploads,

00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:20.530 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"/${this.place.photo || 'store.png'}." The
alt should be "${this.place.name}."

00:21:20.530 --> 00:21:23.820 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Right? And then finally we have a
paragraph tag underneath it which is

00:21:23.820 --> 00:21:30.070 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"${this.place.name} - ." And then we can
take the "${this.place.location.address}"

00:21:30.070 --> 00:21:35.830 line:100% position:50% align:middle
because that will tell us actually where
it is. So we have this HTML that we just

00:21:35.830 --> 00:21:39.540 line:100% position:50% align:middle
created, now we can take that variable and
put it into our setContent.

00:21:39.540 --> 00:21:43.850 line:100% position:50% align:middle
What's cool about this is that you can
make any HTML here, and then you can style

00:21:43.850 --> 00:21:48.230 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it any which way you want with just your
regular CSS because it's not in an iframe

00:21:48.230 --> 00:21:53.320 line:100% position:50% align:middle
or anything like that, it's actually part
of your page. So refresh this sucker.

00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:57.560 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now when I click on it, I get the picture,
I get the name, I get the address,

00:21:57.560 --> 00:22:04.500 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and I'm able to click through to the
actual store page. Good. One last piece.

00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:08.980 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Or you can bask in how amazing this is. So
take a second to take it all in and read

00:22:08.980 --> 00:22:15.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
through this. But the last piece is when I
type in, let's say I was zoomed somewhere

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:19.740 line:100% position:50% align:middle
totally different, and then I type in
"Hamilton". What should happen is we

00:22:19.740 --> 00:22:24.850 line:100% position:50% align:middle
should get the lat, long of this, and then
we should try loadPlaces for the lat and

00:22:24.850 --> 00:22:29.710 line:100% position:50% align:middle
long that the person has typed in. Right?
Because this is not showing every store,

00:22:29.710 --> 00:22:34.700 line:100% position:50% align:middle
this is just showing us the 10 closest
within 10 kilometers of our lat and our

00:22:34.700 --> 00:22:39.300 line:100% position:50% align:middle
long. So we can go back down to this
makeMap function where we created our

00:22:39.300 --> 00:22:43.840 line:100% position:50% align:middle
autocomplete and we can listen for when
that autocomplete changes itself.

00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:49.040 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So say "autocomplete," and we will add a
listener. And the listener is called

00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:53.430 line:100% position:50% align:middle
place_changed. You remember this from the
ad page, we've done it.

00:22:53.430 --> 00:22:56.330 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And when that happens we can run a quick
little arrow function here,

00:22:56.330 --> 00:23:00.250 line:100% position:50% align:middle
don't need a full function because we
don't need "this." And we'll say "const

00:23:00.250 --> 00:23:06.650 line:100% position:50% align:middle
place = autocomplete.getPlace."
Console.log the place just to make sure

00:23:06.650 --> 00:23:12.290 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we're not doing anything wrong. So we'll
type in "Hamilton." And you see that

00:23:12.290 --> 00:23:17.240 line:100% position:50% align:middle
console.log, you get all the information
about this place that you did.

00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:23.290 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So if I were to say "Paris," again we're
going to get all the information about

00:23:23.290 --> 00:23:28.340 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Paris. Oh, I actually have to select one
of them, otherwise it just tells me

00:23:28.340 --> 00:23:32.680 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"Paris." There go. There's the information
about it. You get the point,

00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:37.880 line:100% position:50% align:middle
right? So we have this place here. And all
we really need to do now is call our

00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:43.180 line:100% position:50% align:middle
function, loadPlaces, and we pass it our
map, we pass it our lat.

00:23:43.180 --> 00:23:55.290 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So place.geometry.location.lat. And then
just take that sucker and change it out

00:23:55.290 --> 00:24:05.370 line:100% position:50% align:middle
with "lng." Okay, so we only have places
in Hamilton right now,

00:24:05.370 --> 00:24:10.100 line:100% position:50% align:middle
so the way to test this is you can move
yourself away somewhere where it doesn't

00:24:10.100 --> 00:24:17.640 line:100% position:50% align:middle
have any places. And then we will search
for "Hamilton". And then it will go to our

00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:22.870 line:100% position:50% align:middle
API, come back. You can tell that it's
actually working if you go to your network

00:24:22.870 --> 00:24:31.510 line:100% position:50% align:middle
tab and you were to look at XHR, and then
make the actual call yourself.

00:24:31.510 --> 00:24:35.910 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And the request should show up in here.
There we go, near lat,

00:24:35.910 --> 00:24:39.520 line:100% position:50% align:middle
long. You can see that the data actually
comes back. If I were to search for

00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:45.200 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"Paris," somewhere where I do not have any
places, "Paris," it tells us "no places

00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:48.430 line:100% position:50% align:middle
found" because that's all of the error
handling we've introduced here.

00:24:48.430 --> 00:24:52.520 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Right? But if I were then to log in and
add a place in Paris, let's try it.

00:24:52.520 --> 00:24:57.480 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Log in, let's add a new one. I was in
Paris once, Au Père Louis.

00:24:57.480 --> 00:25:05.600 line:100% position:50% align:middle
There we go, that's where I want it. We'll
call it Au Père Louis,

00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:14.900 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"Great place for snails." We'll upload a
quick photo. Go to save.

00:25:14.900 --> 00:25:20.680 line:100% position:50% align:middle
There. So we added a place in Paris. Now
if I were to go to our map and search for

00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:27.160 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"Paris," then it will find only one place
and it will show us Au Père Louis.

00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:32.480 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I can open it up, I see a picture of it.
Oh, one weird thing, that's not our actual

00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:38.250 line:100% position:50% align:middle
photo. We click through to it, it should
be bread but it's showing us this.

00:25:38.250 --> 00:25:44.460 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So what's wrong with our HTML that we did?
"this.place," does this place not have a

00:25:44.460 --> 00:25:50.250 line:100% position:50% align:middle
photo? The way we can tell, console.log
this.place. Check it out,

00:25:50.250 --> 00:25:56.110 line:100% position:50% align:middle
search for "Paris." Click on it and we
look it up. Description,

00:25:56.110 --> 00:25:59.880 line:100% position:50% align:middle
location, name, slug. Oh, you know what we
didn't do is our API is not returning a

00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:05.260 line:100% position:50% align:middle
photo. Right? Because we didn't ask for
it. So if we go into our storeController,

00:26:05.260 --> 00:26:07.880 line:100% position:50% align:middle
go down to where we made this. Remember we
asked for the slug,

00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:12.400 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the name, description, and location, and
then the photo. Watch this.

00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:18.220 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Refresh. Then we search for "Paris."
Better see some bread. There we go,

00:26:18.220 --> 00:26:21.860 line:100% position:50% align:middle
then the actual bread is showing up. So
our fallback was kicking in because we did

00:26:21.860 --> 00:26:26.290 line:100% position:50% align:middle
not explicitly ask for the photo. So that
is our Google Maps up and running,

00:26:26.290 --> 00:26:29.969 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it's kind of a cool way to use
an API on your own website.

00:26:29.969 --> 00:26:32.969 line:100% position:50% align:middle
