In this video we're going to talk
about doing this tags page.

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:18.050 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now the tags page is going to be
a little bit different because

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:22.220 line:100% position:50% align:middle
there's really two pieces of data that
needs to be pulled in for each of these

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:27.680 line:100% position:50% align:middle
pages. First, we need a list of all of the
possible tags, and each tag needs to know

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:32.030 line:100% position:50% align:middle
how many stores are in that tag. And then
second, when we go to a tag page,

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:37.250 line:100% position:50% align:middle
like "family friendly," it's going to
filter for all of the stores that have

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.830 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that specific tag. We have a little bit of
a problem. Let's focus on just this part

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:44.360 line:100% position:50% align:middle
right now, and then in a future video,
we're going to look at

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.750 line:100% position:50% align:middle
how do we filter for stores that have
that tag. So let's look at this tag bar

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:54.710 line:100% position:50% align:middle
right now. The problem is how do we make
this sort of aggregation of all of the

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.200 line:100% position:50% align:middle
tags? And if you were to think about this
right now, you might say,

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:02.490 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"Okay, well, will you query every single
store?" Then we'll loop over every single

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:07.230 line:100% position:50% align:middle
store, and we'll loop over every single
store's tags and then just count the

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:12.990 line:100% position:50% align:middle
instances of that. However, that becomes a
little bit slow when you start to get a

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.460 line:100% position:50% align:middle
lot of pieces of content, so if you have
1,000 stores, it doesn't make sense to

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:23.580 line:100% position:50% align:middle
query 1,000 stores, have that data come
back, and then to loop over each and every

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.700 line:100% position:50% align:middle
one of them. As soon as you get into large
data, that can become extremely slow to

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.100 line:100% position:50% align:middle
actually have to get the documents back,
and you can run into problems with your

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:37.010 line:100% position:50% align:middle
server running out of actual memory
because 10,000 documents, each with 10,

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:40.300 line:100% position:50% align:middle
15 fields on them will start to eat up
your memory pretty quickly,

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:45.210 line:100% position:50% align:middle
so that's actually not what we want to do.
And when we have a problem like this,

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:51.080 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we need to ask ourselves, "How can I
offload the heavy lifting off of Node.js

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:56.230 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and onto our database?" Because that's
what databases do. Databases are good at

00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:01.390 line:100% position:50% align:middle
doing complex queries, complex
aggregations. They're able to look at the

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:05.460 line:100% position:50% align:middle
data and quickly filter it for the
specific stuff that it needs,

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:11.110 line:100% position:50% align:middle
so we don't want to do that data in
Node.js specifically. We just want to

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:16.140 line:100% position:50% align:middle
write some code in Node and then pass it
off to MongoDB and tell it,

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.540 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"Hey, MongoDB, you can do this because
you're a little bit better at doing this

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:25.940 line:100% position:50% align:middle
type of thing." So we're going to offload
the heavy lifting over to MongoDB with

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:29.740 line:100% position:50% align:middle
something called an aggregation. And an
aggregation is the ability to...

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:34.660 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I got the docs open right here... An
aggregation is the ability to do sort a

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:39.435 line:100% position:50% align:middle
complex query where often you'll need to
do sort of, like, multiple steps

00:02:39.435 --> 00:02:43.310 line:100% position:50% align:middle
in a query. You might need to select
everything and then filter for those,

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:48.030 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and then modify them or group them
together, or group and then filter each of

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:52.840 line:100% position:50% align:middle
those groups. So if there's multiple steps
in your query and it's not just as simple

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:58.500 line:100% position:50% align:middle
as, "Search for stores with a slug. Give
me stores with these tags.

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:03.190 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Give me the latest top five stores." Those
are all very simple queries,

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:07.630 line:100% position:50% align:middle
but when you get into more advanced
queries, you need to start looking at

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:12.220 line:100% position:50% align:middle
aggregation and using all of these
different operators that MongoDB will

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:16.950 line:100% position:50% align:middle
allow you to do. So an aggregation is
simply just an array. You see that they

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:21.680 line:100% position:50% align:middle
have orders array, where you can pass it
multiple commands where it will first

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:26.540 line:100% position:50% align:middle
match...in this case it matches for things
that have a status of A,

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:32.160 line:100% position:50% align:middle
so you've got A, A, A, D. So that will
match only three of the subsetted ones

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.630 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that we initially had. And then, you can
go ahead and group them together.

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:40.830 line:100% position:50% align:middle
You can add things up. It's sort of like a
reduce function in JavaScript,

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:45.380 line:100% position:50% align:middle
where you can take them from the stage
that they were in, in the raw document

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:49.760 line:100% position:50% align:middle
format and process it into pretty much any
other format that you're looking for.

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:54.670 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And in our case, we're going to take all
of the stores and turn it into...and we're

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:58.480 line:100% position:50% align:middle
going to group it by the actual tags that
they have. So the first thing that we

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:04.200 line:100% position:50% align:middle
should do is go to our tags page and we've
got a 404, so let's go into our index.js

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:09.450 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and set up some routes for our
specific tags page. So I'm going to go to

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:13.170 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the bottom here. I'm going to...you
can...these spaces aren't necessary.

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:19.250 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I just have them for readability. Often
I'll say, "router.get/tags," and when that

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:25.150 line:100% position:50% align:middle
happens, what we're going to do is to
catch errors, and we're going to use the

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:31.780 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"storer controller.get stores by tag," and
then I actually want to set up another

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:39.100 line:100% position:50% align:middle
route, so just duplicate that, and say,
"/tags/tag," and that is going to be a

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:41.900 line:100% position:50% align:middle
colon tag. Why? Because when we look at
this one, it's going to be,

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:48.670 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"/tags/family friendly," or, "WiFi" or
"Open late," or, "licensed." Whatever it

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:51.740 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it. So we want to have routes
for both of those. You can also do,

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:57.280 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I think it's a star question mark, and
that will have a Raj Ex route saying

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:03.270 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that, "This piece right here is totally
optional. However, I often prefer just to

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:07.190 line:100% position:50% align:middle
have two routes with the same controller
just so it's really explicit to me that I

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:15.380 line:100% position:50% align:middle
have tags and "tags/the tag name." Good,
then we'll go into our store controller,

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:21.060 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and we'll go to the bottom here, and we'll
have "exports.get stores by tag." Is that

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:27.280 line:100% position:50% align:middle
what we called it? Yes it is. Equals
Async. Request response. I open that

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:33.630 line:100% position:50% align:middle
sucker up, and then, "response.send." It
works. I've got to go back here and click

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:38.670 line:100% position:50% align:middle
on my tags page, and we see it works.
Good. So now we know that that has all

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:43.200 line:100% position:50% align:middle
been lined up. Now what we need to do is
get a list of all of the stores,

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:50.950 line:100% position:50% align:middle
so we'll say, "const stores = await,"
and here is where it comes in a little bit

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:53.680 line:100% position:50% align:middle
weird. We want to say, "store." and now
we're not going to say,

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:58.440 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"find," because we want to get a list of
tags. So the way that that works is we can

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:03.940 line:100% position:50% align:middle
create our own static methods that live on
our store model, and then we can name them

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:07.570 line:100% position:50% align:middle
whatever it is that we could possibly
want. So we're going to call it,

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:13.310 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"getTagslist," and that is what we're
going to have be returned to us.

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:18.140 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now we want to go back into our store
model here, "store.js" and scroll all the

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:23.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
way down, and we're going to take our
schema, say "storeSchema," and we're

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.380 line:100% position:50% align:middle
going to add a method on to it. And the
way that you add a method on to the schema

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:31.360 line:100% position:50% align:middle
is you put it on ".statics" and then you
make up a method name.

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:36.090 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And what did we call ours? "Get tags
list," and that's going to be equal to a

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:39.570 line:100% position:50% align:middle
function. It's important that we use a
proper function here. Why?

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:44.300 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Because we need to use this inside of the
function, and this function is going to be

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:49.140 line:100% position:50% align:middle
bound to our model. All of the static
methods are bound to the model,

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:53.400 line:100% position:50% align:middle
meaning that we can use all of the
"this.find," and "this." We're going to

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:57.780 line:100% position:50% align:middle
use aggregate inside of it. So do not use
an arrow function, otherwise we cannot use

00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:02.270 line:100% position:50% align:middle
'this" inside of it. So proper function
there. And from that we are going to

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:08.570 line:100% position:50% align:middle
return "this.aggregate" and we're going to
open up and close our parentheses on it.

00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:14.600 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now, "aggregate" is just a method like
"find" or "find by ID" or whatever it is

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:19.190 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that we're looking for like "find one." So
aggregate, it will take an array of

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:26.490 line:100% position:50% align:middle
possible operators of what we're looking
for. Now from that, you can start to use

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:29.740 line:100% position:50% align:middle
any of the different aggregation
operators. And how you find those,

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:38.150 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you just go to "MongoDB aggregate
operators" and we'll take a look.

00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:42.680 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Here we go. They're called pipeline
operators. The pipeline is this array

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:46.470 line:100% position:50% align:middle
here, and you can see that there's all
these different operators,

00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:50.120 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and then the way that you can tell that
they're operators is that they always

00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:54.110 line:100% position:50% align:middle
start with a $ meaning that it still is an
object, but they do something special

00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:58.130 line:100% position:50% align:middle
because they start with a $. And so you
can match things. You can limit,

00:07:58.130 --> 00:08:03.820 line:100% position:50% align:middle
so maybe I want to match things that start
with "Wes," but limit it to two.

00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:08.526 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Or maybe I want to skip. I want to match
10 things but skip the first 10,

00:08:08.526 --> 00:08:14.930 line:100% position:50% align:middle
so give me 11 through 20, unwind group,
sample, sort, geo, near. We're going to be

00:08:14.930 --> 00:08:18.950 line:100% position:50% align:middle
looking at ones like .out, index,
faucet, bucket. There's all kinds of

00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:22.280 line:100% position:50% align:middle
different ones here, and whenever you need
to do any sort of complex query,

00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:26.730 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you'll find yourself on this page, looking
for the possible operators that make sense

00:08:26.730 --> 00:08:31.230 line:100% position:50% align:middle
for you. So in our case, we're going to
use one called "unwind" first.

00:08:31.230 --> 00:08:37.510 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Why? Because we're going to be grouping
all of our items by the number of tags

00:08:37.510 --> 00:08:43.610 line:100% position:50% align:middle
they have. But before you can group by,
you need to "unwind your stores" so that

00:08:43.610 --> 00:08:47.830 line:100% position:50% align:middle
for every single tag that exists for a
store, there's going to be that many

00:08:47.830 --> 00:08:52.320 line:100% position:50% align:middle
stores. That may not make a lot of sense,
but let's go through it right now.

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:58.360 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So first thing we want to do, use $ or you
have to pass an object for each pipeline

00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:05.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
operator. We'll unwind, and we're going to
unwind based on the...

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:09.790 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and then in quotes use "$ tags." And what
that means is that by putting a $ in front

00:09:09.790 --> 00:09:15.960 line:100% position:50% align:middle
of it, you say that, "This is a field on
my document which I wish to unwind." Now

00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:19.330 line:100% position:50% align:middle
let's visualize some stuff here because
this is getting a little bit hairy.

00:09:19.330 --> 00:09:22.670 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we'll go into our store controller
here. We get our stores,

00:09:22.670 --> 00:09:27.160 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and let's just say "res.json stores" and
then refresh our tags page.

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:32.840 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Oh, "store.get tags list" is not a
function. Let's look at our "store.js"

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:38.120 line:100% position:50% align:middle
file. I forgot to save. How does saving
work? There we go. Okay,

00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:44.610 line:100% position:50% align:middle
so what's happening here is that our first
bar, our first store was called "Brew

00:09:44.610 --> 00:09:49.380 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Bar," and it actually had a couple of
different tags. It had one called "family

00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:54.529 line:100% position:50% align:middle
friendly" and "licensed," right?
If we go to this in another page,

00:09:55.140 --> 00:10:00.390 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and we go to "Brew Bar," you see that it's
"family friendly" and "licensed." So what

00:10:00.390 --> 00:10:05.070 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we need to do when we're trying to count
our tags is we need to chalk one up for

00:10:05.070 --> 00:10:09.870 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"friendly family" and "family friendly,"
and we need to chalk one up for

00:10:09.870 --> 00:10:15.980 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"licensed." So by unwinding them, what we
do is we get an instance of a store for

00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:20.800 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"family friendly," and we get an instance
of a store for "licensed." So the coffee

00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:26.620 line:100% position:50% align:middle
shop has "family friendly" and it also has
"vegetarian." "Butcher and the Vegan" has

00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:33.460 line:100% position:50% align:middle
one for "WiFi," as well as "open late," as
well as "family friendly." So it's

00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:37.680 line:100% position:50% align:middle
duplicating the content here, and we don't
really care all that much because what we

00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:43.440 line:100% position:50% align:middle
need to do is each store needs to just
have one tag per se, and then we're going

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:49.020 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to now go ahead and group them in our next
operator. So do comma here,

00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:53.820 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and we'll do another pipeline operator,
which is going to be "$ group," and we

00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:58.610 line:100% position:50% align:middle
want to group by something.
And what do we want to group it by?

00:10:58.610 --> 00:11:02.750 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We want to group it by tags as well as
count them as we're on our way.

00:11:02.750 --> 00:11:08.450 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So you have another object here, which is
the ID, which we're grouping it by.

00:11:08.450 --> 00:11:15.420 line:100% position:50% align:middle
It's going to be $ tags. And we are going
to count. We're going to create a new

00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:20.420 line:100% position:50% align:middle
property here called "count" which is
going to be equal to the sum.

00:11:20.420 --> 00:11:24.200 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And we're just going to add one. Now,
whew! This will probably seem a little bit

00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:27.260 line:100% position:50% align:middle
weird, especially if you're coming from
JavaScript, where you explicitly do

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:30.950 line:100% position:50% align:middle
everything, and this is much more
described. But what we're doing here is

00:11:30.950 --> 00:11:36.350 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that we are going to group everything
based on the tag field, and then we're

00:11:36.350 --> 00:11:42.420 line:100% position:50% align:middle
going to create a new field in each of
those groups called "count." Now each time

00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:48.150 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that we group one of these items, a count
is going to sum itself by one,

00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:51.770 line:100% position:50% align:middle
or maybe it would be better if it was
called "add itself by one," but it's

00:11:51.770 --> 00:11:58.110 line:100% position:50% align:middle
called "sum by one." So let's see what
that gives us. Ah, this is more of what

00:11:58.110 --> 00:12:01.760 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we're looking for, so what that now
returns is not a list of stores because we

00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:05.200 line:100% position:50% align:middle
don't care about the stores, we just care
about a list of tags,

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:10.310 line:100% position:50% align:middle
which will give us the ID, which is tags.
That's what we grouped it by: "Open late,"

00:12:10.310 --> 00:12:14.730 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"WiFi," "Vegetarian," Licensed," and
"Family friendly." And then we added a new

00:12:14.730 --> 00:12:19.900 line:100% position:50% align:middle
property called "Count" which is the sum
of one, and will tell us how many are in

00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:23.610 line:100% position:50% align:middle
each of them. Finally, what we want to do
is "sort by most popular" so "family

00:12:23.610 --> 00:12:28.400 line:100% position:50% align:middle
friendly" has six and "WiFi" has one. That
should be the last, family friendly,

00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:32.210 line:100% position:50% align:middle
should be first, so that 's just another
thing in our pipeline. We will use the

00:12:32.210 --> 00:12:38.170 line:100% position:50% align:middle
operator "sort" and we want to "sort by"
the "count" property,

00:12:38.170 --> 00:12:44.530 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and you can either do it ascending or
descending, which is one or negative one.

00:12:44.530 --> 00:12:48.860 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So when I write these things, I find
myself often on stack overflow or looking

00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:53.280 line:100% position:50% align:middle
at little examples of what I'm trying to
do because they can be fairly complicated,

00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:57.670 line:100% position:50% align:middle
but if you just break it down into the
different pieces of...first unwind it,

00:12:57.670 --> 00:13:02.730 line:100% position:50% align:middle
then group it, then sort that. Then you're
able to sort of see the different

00:13:02.730 --> 00:13:06.572 line:100% position:50% align:middle
factories of your piping data into one,
out of the other, into another.

00:13:06.572 --> 00:13:08.105 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And I guess that's
why it's called "Pipeline"

00:13:08.105 --> 00:13:10.170 line:100% position:50% align:middle
is because you're piping data
in and out, in and out,

00:13:10.170 --> 00:13:15.670 line:100% position:50% align:middle
in and out of all of these different
operators. So now if I refresh that here,

00:13:15.670 --> 00:13:21.140 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we actually have our list of tags. Good.
So we can go back to our controller here,

00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:25.530 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and this should not be called "stores." It
should be called "tags." So "const tags

00:13:25.530 --> 00:13:30.850 line:100% position:50% align:middle
= awaits store.tags." Now we're going
to render out a tag pug file.

00:13:30.850 --> 00:13:35.040 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we'll say "res.render." I'm going to
render out the tag file,

00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:40.320 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and we're going to pass along a bunch of
data, so we'll say the "tags = tags." And

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:43.020 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you're probably getting sick of me saying
this, but you know that you can just pass

00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:47.180 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it like that. Then what other data did we
need? We need a title,

00:13:47.180 --> 00:13:50.740 line:100% position:50% align:middle
which is going to be...let's just call it
"tags" for now. We're going to come back

00:13:50.740 --> 00:13:57.070 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and replace that. So that's good and then
we'll make a new file in our views called

00:13:57.070 --> 00:14:03.132 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"tags.pug extend layout lock content,"
give ourselves an "inner div" inside of

00:14:03.132 --> 00:14:07.504 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that "H2 = title." Let's just double check
that that's actually working.

00:14:07.504 --> 00:14:12.790 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So now if I refresh this. "Failed to look
up. View tag in..." because I called this

00:14:12.790 --> 00:14:18.290 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"tags" with an "s." I need to rename that
to just "tag." There we go.

00:14:18.290 --> 00:14:25.030 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Refresh. You see tags. Can we do a quick
dump? "Three = H.dump tags." There we go.

00:14:25.030 --> 00:14:28.380 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now we see all of the actual data that we
have. So we can just quickly loop over

00:14:28.380 --> 00:14:33.800 line:100% position:50% align:middle
those. You all with the class of "tags"
then we say "each T N tags," so I'm just

00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:39.950 line:100% position:50% align:middle
going to call this one "short form T" and
you'll say "li.tags" or "li.tag." A with a

00:14:39.950 --> 00:14:49.420 line:100% position:50% align:middle
class of "tag_ _ link" and that is going
to link off to "/tags/" and this is how we

00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:54.990 line:100% position:50% align:middle
are going to grab it. So it's going to
link to "/Open late/ Vegetarian." So if

00:14:54.990 --> 00:15:01.650 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"T" is the tag property object, then how
do we get the ID? Well it's "T.

00:15:01.650 --> 00:15:09.050 line:100% position:50% align:middle
_ID." That's good, and then inside of
that, we want to have a span with a class

00:15:09.050 --> 00:15:14.990 line:100% position:50% align:middle
of tag text, "Tag_ID." And we'll have
another one with a tag "_count," which

00:15:14.990 --> 00:15:18.500 line:100% position:50% align:middle
will be a "T.count." Good. "Family
Friendly," "Open Late," "Vegetarian,"

00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:22.070 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"Licensed" and "WiFi." Now if I were to
click over to one of them,

00:15:22.070 --> 00:15:26.040 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you can take that a little bit further, so
I'll click on "Open late." There we go.

00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:29.760 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now we're on the "Open Late" page. It
would be cool if we could highlight the

00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:34.860 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"Open Late" to be active. So in order to
do that, we need to pass the data about

00:15:34.860 --> 00:15:39.290 line:100% position:50% align:middle
what page we're on over to our template.
We'll head back to our store controller,

00:15:39.290 --> 00:15:47.690 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and up here we'll say, "const tag =
request.params.tag" and then we'll pass

00:15:47.690 --> 00:15:54.620 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the data over here. Tag, and we'll go back
into our file here and we could put in

00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:58.860 line:100% position:50% align:middle
parentheses...here if we make this just
"H2 title " and then we could do another

00:15:58.860 --> 00:16:06.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
one "Tag." Put it in parentheses, then if
we are on "Open Late,

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:13.160 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Vegetarian, Licensed, WiFi, then we could
even replace the title altogether just

00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:17.210 line:100% position:50% align:middle
with the actual tag property. So now if we
click through to each of them,

00:16:17.210 --> 00:16:23.030 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we're in good shape. Then we want to add
an active class to this link when we are

00:16:23.030 --> 00:16:27.870 line:100% position:50% align:middle
on the page. So this link right here, we
want to add a class. Even though we used a

00:16:27.870 --> 00:16:31.760 line:100% position:50% align:middle
class this way, you can also add class
properties like this. And that class is

00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:36.700 line:100% position:50% align:middle
going to be equal to parentheses. And
we're going to say, "If the tag

00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:40.770 line:100% position:50% align:middle
ID"...which is going to be the name of the
tag..."is equal to"...

00:16:40.770 --> 00:16:44.700 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Triple equals the actual tag, so if
they're the same, which means that if

00:16:44.700 --> 00:16:49.940 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we're on "Licensed," and the current
iteration is licensed, then we want to...?

00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:58.130 line:100% position:50% align:middle
This is a turnary operator where you say
"tag_link," "Only two - - active."

00:16:58.130 --> 00:17:01.610 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Otherwise, we're just going to put
nothing. Give that a refresh.

00:17:01.610 --> 00:17:08.130 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And now you see like, when you are on that
page, it will give it a class of "taglink

00:17:08.130 --> 00:17:13.010 line:100% position:50% align:middle
active," and then the CSS, which makes it
purple, will kick in and actually

00:17:13.010 --> 00:17:16.910 line:100% position:50% align:middle
highlight that specific one. Good. We'll
just go back to our tags page here.

00:17:16.910 --> 00:17:19.810 line:100% position:50% align:middle
You'll see that there is actually nothing
here. So you could say,

00:17:19.810 --> 00:17:27.110 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"Tag" or "Tags" in the title. And then on
the tags page, it's going to fall back to

00:17:27.110 --> 00:17:30.916 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the word "tags." And if we actually are on
a specific tags page,

00:17:30.916 --> 00:17:36.580 line:100% position:50% align:middle
then we can see which one we have. Whew, I
feel like that was a lot of me saying the

00:17:36.580 --> 00:17:41.310 line:100% position:50% align:middle
word "Tags," so let's take a break. Go
grab a coffee, and I'll meet you back in

00:17:41.310 --> 00:17:46.877 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the next video where we look at how to
query for specific stores that have that

00:17:46.877 --> 00:17:48.045 line:100% position:50% align:middle
specific...
