The last thing we need to nail before we
can get building this sucker is the

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:19.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
concept of middleware. Now, middleware is
fairly fundamental to Express.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.830 line:100% position:50% align:middle
It's how almost all Express plugins are
working, so it's pretty important that at

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:28.820 line:100% position:50% align:middle
least we get an introduction to it here,
and then we'll be coming back to it over

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.940 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and over throughout this entire
course. So what is middleware?

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:36.570 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Well, if we look at our method here,
homePage, you know we have a request and

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.120 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you know we have a response. So request is
the data that sort of comes in,

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:45.520 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and the response is the data that goes
out. Now, in between the request and the

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:51.440 line:100% position:50% align:middle
response, sometimes a bunch of work needs
to happen. You might need to call the

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.760 line:100% position:50% align:middle
database, you might need to do some data
normalization. So any work that needs to

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.540 line:100% position:50% align:middle
happen along the way, of course it could
happen inside of the homePage,

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:05.170 line:100% position:50% align:middle
but if I were, say, uploading a file, I
might write in middleware to handle the

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:08.890 line:100% position:50% align:middle
uploading of the file, and to
rename the file, and to resize it,

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:13.210 line:100% position:50% align:middle
because I don't want to associate that
code just with the homePage.

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:18.400 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Because uploading a file code could happen
on any specific page.

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.750 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So what we can do, if we take a look at
this diagram that I have,

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.330 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you see we start with our request and we
end with displaying a profile or

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.870 line:100% position:50% align:middle
displaying a login. So like, let's assume
that somebody is trying to login to a form

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:35.380 line:100% position:50% align:middle
tag with a POST request, and at the end of
the day, they either are logged in,

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:41.090 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we show them their account, or they are
not logged in, and we show them an error

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.990 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and we redirect them to the login page.
But in between the request,

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.220 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the beginning, and the response, the end,
we need to do a whole bunch of stuff.

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.900 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we might, first of all, do something
called a bodyParser, which is some

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:57.340 line:100% position:50% align:middle
middleware we're using in our app.js.
We'll look at it in just a second,

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:04.300 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and what that will do is, when somebody
POSTs a form, it will make the form field,

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:07.260 line:100% position:50% align:middle
email and password,
available to us on the request.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:11.780 line:100% position:50% align:middle
That doesn't happen by default, but the
bodyParser is going to take the data from

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.490 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the request and make them into nice
properties on our req.body.

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:19.390 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Then we'll call something called next,
which is essentially like,

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.410 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"Done with this middleware, on to the next
one." And then maybe we'll have a function

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:27.980 line:100% position:50% align:middle
called emailNormailze where, you know,
sometimes people try to login with,

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:33.020 line:100% position:50% align:middle
like, mixed case and spaces, and maybe
your database needs no spaces and all

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:38.160 line:100% position:50% align:middle
lowercase. So what do you do? You take the
req.body.email that the bodyParser gave

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:43.530 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you in the last function, and we'll trim
it and lowercase it so that we know that

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:49.900 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it's nice and clean data. Now, the
req.body.email is in a situation where we

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:54.010 line:100% position:50% align:middle
can start calling a database. Then we call
next, because we're done with that piece

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:57.930 line:100% position:50% align:middle
of middleware. We'll move on to
authorizeUser, and auth middleware is

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.410 line:100% position:50% align:middle
going to lookup the user, it's going to
check that the password is correct,

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:05.740 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it's going to check that they're actually
a user, and if that is true,

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:10.780 line:100% position:50% align:middle
then it's going to put the user's
information on the request object.

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:16.450 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So you sort of see how the request is
going through, like, an assembly line of

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:21.210 line:100% position:50% align:middle
different middlewares, and as we go along
we just start tacking stuff that we might

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:25.820 line:100% position:50% align:middle
need down the road onto the request
object. That's sort of the catch-all,

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:30.830 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that's how we put data into an object in
order to get it somewhere down the line.

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:37.400 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So in here, if I was valid logged in, then
the next middleware would kick in,

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:41.190 line:100% position:50% align:middle
which is displayProfile. Otherwise, we
would an hit an invalid,

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:44.040 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we would catch that error, we're going to
look at that when we display the login,

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.670 line:100% position:50% align:middle
where we do something called flashing and
redirect them.

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:51.010 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So if we take a look at our
storeController here, what we could do is,

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:56.760 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we could say exports.myMiddleware = (req,
res,

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.380 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and now, if you are writing middleware,
you need to pass the next),

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:04.230 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and I'll show you why. So we'll do an
arrow function here,

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:10.750 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and then on this, we'll just say req.name
= 'Wes' and then we'll call next.

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:14.690 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And what next will do is say, "Okay, I've
done my work in this middleware,

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:18.470 line:100% position:50% align:middle
pass it off to the next piece." And then
we have our homePage.

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:23.140 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So how do we use that then? We'll go back
our routes, and now our routes are saying,

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:28.860 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"When someone visits forward slash, pass
them to the homePage." But now we're going

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:33.980 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to say, "When somebody gets to the forward
slash, pass them to..." What did we call

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:39.650 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it here? myMiddleware, and then we pass it
as a next parameter,

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:46.130 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we pass it homePage. And because this
myMiddleware here will call .next,

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:51.200 line:100% position:50% align:middle
then it will just pass it on to the next
function that is in line.

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:56.020 line:100% position:50% align:middle
You could handle the response right inside
of myMiddleware, maybe there was an error

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:00.020 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and we could redirect them to a different
page, but in this case,

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:04.790 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we're calling next, which is going to pass
it to the next one down the road.

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:09.180 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So if I give this a save now and I were to
go into our storeController,

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:13.090 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I could go into my homePage and
console.log(req.name).

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:18.040 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And I should be able to see 'Wes' because
it's been set in a previous middleware as

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:22.050 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we go. So let's open up our terminal here,
let's clear it out,

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:26.540 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and I've refreshed the page, and I now see
Wes. Even though these are two separate

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:31.980 line:100% position:50% align:middle
functions, I've sort of passed it
downstream by putting it on the request

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:37.330 line:100% position:50% align:middle
object. So middleware is something that
will allow you to dip in.

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:41.590 line:100% position:50% align:middle
It's sort of like in React, we have
lifecycle hooks, where you can hook in at

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:47.330 line:100% position:50% align:middle
any point in time. Middleware allows us to
run code after the request but before the

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:53.150 line:100% position:50% align:middle
response actually happens. So that's an
example of route-specific middleware,

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:58.300 line:100% position:50% align:middle
however Express also has global
middlewares, where every single request

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:01.600 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that goes through the application will run
through the middleware,

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:05.130 line:100% position:50% align:middle
before it even gets to your router, it's
going to run through some middleware.

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:09.850 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And that's generally where we introduce
any application wide functionality,

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:12.610 line:100% position:50% align:middle
or features, or plugins, or anything that
needs to happen like that.

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:16.580 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And where does that happen? Well, that's
what most of app.js is,

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:19.800 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and if you're looking at this and thinking
there's a lot of setup code,

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:25.100 line:100% position:50% align:middle
this is where we start to break it down.
So let's go and open up our app.js here,

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:31.910 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and we will take a look. Anywhere you see
app.use, what that means is that we are

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:38.630 line:100% position:50% align:middle
using this global middleware. So even
before we get to our routes,

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:40.860 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we are going to run all
of these middlewares.

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:46.460 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we have app.use(express.static. What
does that mean? Well, that means that we

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:51.550 line:100% position:50% align:middle
have a folder here, called public, and we
have images, and we have sass,

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:56.450 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and we have uploads, and all kinds of
stuff that goes in these folders,

00:06:56.450 --> 00:07:02.640 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and if somebody requests anything from the
public folder, it's just going to serve up

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:06.610 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that actual image before it even tries to
think if it's a route or not.

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:11.610 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Because if you look for dog.jpeg, it's not
going to go in here and look for dog.jpeg.

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:15.580 line:100% position:50% align:middle
It will know, because it's in the public
folder, just give them the file that

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:21.950 line:100% position:50% align:middle
they're looking for. Next one is
bodyParser.json and the

00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:26.720 line:100% position:50% align:middle
bodyParser.urlencoded. That means that
anytime somebody submits data via a form

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:33.180 line:100% position:50% align:middle
tag what will happen is that you will get
that data that has been submitted on your

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:38.890 line:100% position:50% align:middle
req.body and it's all going to be url
encoded, and you don't have to worry about

00:07:38.890 --> 00:07:43.400 line:100% position:50% align:middle
dissecting it from the request at all.
It's just going to be, if someone submits

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:47.260 line:100% position:50% align:middle
a form with a name, and email, and a
password, you're going to have three

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:49.620 line:100% position:50% align:middle
properties called name,
email, and password.

00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:56.540 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And the bodyParser makes that, that's part
of Express' bodyParser package.

00:07:56.540 --> 00:08:01.160 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So Express doesn't come with it built in,
but they maintain it and you can add it in

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:05.630 line:100% position:50% align:middle
should you need that. Then we have
something called expressValidator,

00:08:05.630 --> 00:08:09.480 line:100% position:50% align:middle
which is going to validate any sort of
email stuff. We'll be looking at that when

00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:14.230 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we get more into submitting forms and
logging in. Then we have a cookieParser.

00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:19.890 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So by default Express doesn't do anything
with cookies, but if you want to set

00:08:19.890 --> 00:08:25.080 line:100% position:50% align:middle
cookies, you can, because by using the
cookieParser middleware it will then give

00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:29.890 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you req.cookies, and we're going to need
that to be working with our log in

00:08:29.890 --> 00:08:34.860 line:100% position:50% align:middle
sessions. But what you could do is, you
could go to your middleware here in our

00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:35.570 line:100% position:50% align:middle
storeController.

00:08:35.570 --> 00:08:42.530 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We can say res.cookie and we could set a
name cookie to be 'Wes is cool' and you

00:08:42.530 --> 00:08:46.470 line:100% position:50% align:middle
want to set that...there's some options in
here like maxAge, how long the cookie

00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:52.970 line:100% position:50% align:middle
would be valid for. And now, if I refresh
this page and open up my DevTools here to

00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:57.570 line:100% position:50% align:middle
our Application tab and look at Cookies,
you'll see that there,

00:08:57.570 --> 00:09:02.150 line:100% position:50% align:middle
name cookie is now set to 'Wes is cool. '
And there's also one called sweetsesh,

00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:05.530 line:100% position:50% align:middle
which we'll talk about in just a second.
So that's what the cookie middleware will

00:09:05.530 --> 00:09:10.280 line:100% position:50% align:middle
allow us to do if you ever need to set
cookies. We don't directly use that,

00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:15.730 line:100% position:50% align:middle
but using sessions in our application, we
will. If we keep going along,

00:09:15.730 --> 00:09:21.810 line:100% position:50% align:middle
here's the session part. So what sessions
will allow us to do is to store data on

00:09:21.810 --> 00:09:25.090 line:100% position:50% align:middle
our visitors, their logged in state, how
long they've been logged in,

00:09:25.090 --> 00:09:29.720 line:100% position:50% align:middle
any information that you need to go from
request to request, that's going to be

00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:30.880 line:100% position:50% align:middle
stored in our session.

00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:35.550 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we use that to set up, and we'll go
more into that once we start talking about

00:09:35.550 --> 00:09:40.560 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it. Sessions are stored in our MongoDB
database, and then we have our passport.

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:44.210 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We'll talk more about that when we do
login, we'll talk more about flashing once

00:09:44.210 --> 00:09:48.970 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we get into logging in and
showing status of logged in or not.

00:09:48.970 --> 00:09:53.810 line:100% position:50% align:middle
This middleware will give us all of our
local helpers, that's what allows us to

00:09:53.810 --> 00:09:59.370 line:100% position:50% align:middle
get that H variable that we used a little
bit earlier. Then after all that above

00:09:59.370 --> 00:10:03.010 line:100% position:50% align:middle
middleware, we finally inject
our own routes.

00:10:03.010 --> 00:10:07.580 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we say app.use('/', so anything that
comes after the forward slash,

00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:12.320 line:100% position:50% align:middle
use our routes file. And then our routes
files exports our router,

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:16.910 line:100% position:50% align:middle
which will then handle the individual
forward slash routes that are needed.

00:10:16.910 --> 00:10:20.650 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So that's why we have that here, and then
after, you're actually going to see a

00:10:20.650 --> 00:10:26.550 line:100% position:50% align:middle
couple more middlewares after the routes,
because if something goes wrong in this

00:10:26.550 --> 00:10:29.800 line:100% position:50% align:middle
route, what happens? Remember how all of
the stuff is sequential,

00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:34.100 line:100% position:50% align:middle
right? Above it we do all the cookie
stuff, and the helpers, and the flashing,

00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:39.900 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and our sessions, and our bodyParser. That
all need to happen before we hit a route,

00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:44.760 line:100% position:50% align:middle
then we do all of our url routes, but if
something happens here,

00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:49.590 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we need some stuff after the fact to sort
of like be a safety net,

00:10:49.590 --> 00:10:55.010 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and those are called error handlers. So
first we say if there was no route here

00:10:55.010 --> 00:10:58.440 line:100% position:50% align:middle
found, then it's just going to keep moving
on to the next middleware.

00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:00.140 line:100% position:50% align:middle
You see how we sort of queued
up these middlewares?

00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:06.100 line:100% position:50% align:middle
If nothing is found in here, like if I go
to /nope, what happens?

00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:09.560 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We hit a 404, and that's when the notFound
middleware, and I've put these in their

00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:12.200 line:100% position:50% align:middle
own file, if we open up errorHandlers. And
don't worry if this doesn't make a whole

00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:15.040 line:100% position:50% align:middle
lot of sense just yet, I just kind of want
to give you an idea,

00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:19.100 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and then as we learn in this application,
you'll get a better idea.

00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:29.920 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we have a notFound, which is simply
just a middleware that will make a new

00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:34.370 line:100% position:50% align:middle
error, and then it'll set the error status
to 404 and then call next.

00:11:34.370 --> 00:11:39.860 line:100% position:50% align:middle
But if you pass next something, it will
assume that what you are passing it is an

00:11:39.860 --> 00:11:44.600 line:100% position:50% align:middle
error. So we set a little bit of
information about what error happened,

00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:49.270 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and we pass it along, which was here, and
then the next one. So if we're in

00:11:49.270 --> 00:11:52.570 line:100% position:50% align:middle
development, we're going to handle
development errors, which will show us

00:11:52.570 --> 00:11:55.430 line:100% position:50% align:middle
what's called a stack trace, all the
information about what happened,

00:11:55.430 --> 00:11:59.970 line:100% position:50% align:middle
but if we are in production, we don't want
to show the user, "Oh,

00:11:59.970 --> 00:12:02.690 line:100% position:50% align:middle
there was an error that happened on this
line of code."

00:12:02.690 --> 00:12:06.800 line:100% position:50% align:middle
You just want to say, "Oops. Something
went wrong," and handle that internally,

00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:10.740 line:100% position:50% align:middle
so that will happen with production
errors. So it's sort of this like this

00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:16.370 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Plinko machine, where you put a request in
at the top and it just filters its way all

00:12:16.370 --> 00:12:22.420 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the way through all of these middlewares,
and in most cases, our out point is in the

00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:27.170 line:100% position:50% align:middle
routes. But if something were to go wrong,
then after our error handling middleware

00:12:27.170 --> 00:12:30.730 line:100% position:50% align:middle
is going to kick in, and I can show you
how to use that. We'll be doing it a lot,

00:12:30.730 --> 00:12:34.220 line:100% position:50% align:middle
but if we go to our storeController, and
maybe even before next,

00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:39.770 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we were to say, if(req.name === 'Wes')

00:12:39.770 --> 00:12:48.790 line:100% position:50% align:middle
then we could simply just throw
Error('That is a stupid name').

00:12:48.790 --> 00:12:55.010 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And then when we refresh this, go to our
home, say That is a stupid name.

00:12:55.010 --> 00:13:00.120 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And then it tells us on storeController.js
line 4, right here,

00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:03.550 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that's where the error happened, and then
it gives us information,

00:13:03.550 --> 00:13:08.440 line:100% position:50% align:middle
this is called a stack trace here is what
led up until this error.

00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:12.900 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Most cases, you just need a couple lines
to figure out what happened,

00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:16.140 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and then we display the actual error. If
this was in production,

00:13:16.140 --> 00:13:20.880 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you would not see the stack trace here,
you would just see the specific error that

00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:25.390 line:100% position:50% align:middle
happened. The user would see that. So in
this case, the next never got called.

00:13:25.390 --> 00:13:31.110 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Why? Because an error was thrown and then
our middleware picked it up,

00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:37.610 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and our development error handler figured
it out. I just did a little find and

00:13:37.610 --> 00:13:42.470 line:100% position:50% align:middle
replace on the file names here, just
because I hate looking at these stack

00:13:42.470 --> 00:13:47.390 line:100% position:50% align:middle
traces and I find that if you highlight
them, it can tell you really quickly where

00:13:47.390 --> 00:13:51.050 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you need to look, and more often that not,
you accidentally misspelled something or

00:13:51.050 --> 00:13:53.460 line:100% position:50% align:middle
did a semicolon in the wrong spot.

00:13:53.460 --> 00:13:57.510 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So that's sort of a high level, and don't
worry too too much if that doesn't make a

00:13:57.510 --> 00:14:01.290 line:100% position:50% align:middle
whole lot of sense, just because this is
all theoretical. I think,

00:14:01.290 --> 00:14:05.660 line:100% position:50% align:middle
at least for me, where this starts to
click in is when we actually start to put

00:14:05.660 --> 00:14:08.141 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it into use. So let's get doing that.

00:14:08.141 --> 00:14:11.141 line:100% position:50% align:middle
