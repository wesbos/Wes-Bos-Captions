00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.330 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Our home page and our stores page is
starting to get really, really long.

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.070 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I think we have something about 15, 16
different stores on the home page. And if

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:23.290 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we were to continually add that up to
1,000 or 2,000 stores then that would take

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:27.500 line:100% position:50% align:middle
way too long to actually load the page
because each of these stores has an image

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:31.218 line:100% position:50% align:middle
associated with it. So we need to
introduce pagination which allows us to

00:00:31.218 --> 00:00:36.630 line:100% position:50% align:middle
skip from page to page to page to page.
Great. So what we essentially need to do

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:43.460 line:100% position:50% align:middle
is to go into our store controller and we
need to modify our get stores function to

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:50.540 line:100% position:50% align:middle
not just find all of them, but to find a
specific number of stores and we need to

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:55.060 line:100% position:50% align:middle
skip it. So let's say we're showing three
or four per page. If I'm showing four per

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:59.850 line:100% position:50% align:middle
page, page one is one through four then on
page two I need to skip four and start at

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.660 line:100% position:50% align:middle
five, six, seven, eight,
you get the point, right?

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:08.530 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we first want to create a new route
because the way that the urls are

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:15.573 line:100% position:50% align:middle
going to work we are going to go
/stores/page/two, /three, /four,

00:01:15.573 --> 00:01:19.660 line:100% position:50% align:middle
those are going to be the pages that we're
on. So let's open up our index.js and

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:24.820 line:100% position:50% align:middle
let's look for our...here we go. We've got
store, let's just duplicate and modify it

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:28.860 line:100% position:50% align:middle
how we want it. Let's go back to our get
stores function here and I am going to put

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.960 line:100% position:50% align:middle
this find on its own line and take off the
semicolon because there's a lot that we're

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:37.100 line:100% position:50% align:middle
going to be going through here.
So first thing that we need is we need a

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.930 line:100% position:50% align:middle
variable for what page we are on, so we'll
say const page is equal to and ideally we

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:48.610 line:100% position:50% align:middle
get that from the url request.params.page
but if we're on the home page like we are

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:53.040 line:100% position:50% align:middle
clicking on stores right here or we are on
the home page, there is no store...there

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.740 line:100% position:50% align:middle
is no page number and in that case we just
show them one so we say or one.

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:03.780 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Then we need a limit, how many do you want
to show per page so we'll say const limit

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.286 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and let's set it to four, four per page.

00:02:15.888 --> 00:02:17.315 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now we need to make our skip.

00:02:17.315 --> 00:02:20.810 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we're going to make a const skip equals
and what skip is going to be is if we're

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:25.310 line:100% position:50% align:middle
on page two, we want to skip four
because we are showing five,

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:29.720 line:100% position:50% align:middle
six, seven, eight. If we're on page one,
our skip is going to be zero.

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.260 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So in order for us to do that, we take the
page which is we're on page one,

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:38.760 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and we multiply that by the limit that is
four, and that's going to give us page

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.580 line:100% position:50% align:middle
times limit, that's going to give
us four minus the actual limit,

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:48.190 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and let's just think about that a second.
So page one, let's do some math here,

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:54.590 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we're on page one, we're going to multiply
that by four, and then we're going to

00:02:54.590 --> 00:03:01.530 line:100% position:50% align:middle
subtract four so that will give us a skip
of zero. And then if we're on page two

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.690 line:100% position:50% align:middle
times four, that's going to give us eight
minus four, we want to skip four.

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:11.420 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So that's in pretty good shape so far.
Then we can go down to our find here and

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:16.990 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we're going to implement a skip which is
our skip variable and we are going to

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:22.530 line:100% position:50% align:middle
limit it to the number that we have. So
let's try it out. We go to our stores.

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:30.430 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We go to page two and we're seeing
The Burnt Tongue, Bar Izakaya,

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:38.220 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Mulberry Coffee, Olive Oil, page one,
we see Charred, page three,

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:42.440 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we see that, and if we just go to the
home page, we see Charred, our four.

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:46.660 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we know our pagination is actually
working. Now we need to make some sort of

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:51.730 line:100% position:50% align:middle
interface to actually handle showing the
next and the previous values.

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:56.400 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we're going to make ourselves another
mixin called pagination so we'll go to

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.623 line:100% position:50% align:middle
views, mixin, we'll make a...

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:09.644 line:100% position:50% align:middle
...mixin pagination.
It's going to take in the

00:04:09.644 --> 00:04:15.720 line:100% position:50% align:middle
current page, the number of pages, and the
count, two of these things which we do not

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:23.830 line:100% position:50% align:middle
have just yet. Then we'll have a
pagination div. We'll have a

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:27.830 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"pagination__previous" and we'll
say, "if page is greater than one,"

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:32.210 line:100% position:50% align:middle
so if we're not on page one because
otherwise we would need to be able to...we

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:42.395 line:100% position:50% align:middle
wouldn't want to say previous on page one,
"then we do 'a ref = stores/page/'" and

00:04:42.395 --> 00:04:48.210 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we want to take the current page and
remove it, bring it down by one,

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:54.120 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and we'll say previous then in between
we're going to have some text,

00:04:54.120 --> 00:05:03.980 line:100% position:50% align:middle
so pagination text. We'll put a paragraph
tag and we'll say "page of" how many pages

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:09.460 line:100% position:50% align:middle
are there, we're going to have to figure
that in a second, we'll give it a dash out

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:16.300 line:100% position:50% align:middle
of how many total results, count total
results. Then that should be indented and

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:21.110 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we'll have a pagination next and we'll say
"if the page is less than the number of

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:26.580 line:100% position:50% align:middle
pages," so if we're not on the last one,
then we give ourselves a ref to the

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:30.690 line:100% position:50% align:middle
next one. And then reason why we need to
do that because it will think that this

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:34.560 line:100% position:50% align:middle
page is an actual string and a string plus
a number will give you 11,

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:40.090 line:100% position:50% align:middle
string of 1 plus 1 will give you 11.
And we'll say next.

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:42.810 line:100% position:50% align:middle
There's a couple of things we need here.
We need to be able to...we know what page

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:47.180 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we're on. We do not know how many pages
there are in total and we do not know how

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:52.520 line:100% position:50% align:middle
many values there are in total. So we have
to go back to our store controller here

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:58.440 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and get a couple more of those actual
values. So our first question is if we're

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:03.580 line:100% position:50% align:middle
now limiting the number that we find, how
do we possibly know how many items are

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:07.690 line:100% position:50% align:middle
actually in the database? Well, what we
can do is rather than query the entire

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:11.960 line:100% position:50% align:middle
database for every single store, we can
actually use something in MongoDB called

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:15.410 line:100% position:50% align:middle
count and that will not return us all the
documents, it'll just tell us how many

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:18.280 line:100% position:50% align:middle
there are and that's going
to be really nice and quick.

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:22.600 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So rather than awaiting our store data,
we're going to be doing two queries and

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:26.690 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we're going to use promise.all to wait on
both of them. We've done this already once

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:31.250 line:100% position:50% align:middle
before but let's do it once more. So we'll
go in here "const stores = await."

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:38.750 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We will rename this to storesPromise and
we will take the await off. Then we'll go

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:46.935 line:100% position:50% align:middle
down here and we'll say const count
promise is equal to Store.count and what

00:06:46.935 --> 00:06:50.310 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that will do is it will return a promise
of when it comes back from counting them

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:55.430 line:100% position:50% align:middle
all, it'll give us the actual data.
Then we're not awaiting either of these.

00:06:55.430 --> 00:07:01.560 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We can await both of them at the same time
so stores count is equal to await and we

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:06.570 line:100% position:50% align:middle
say promise.all, remember we can pass
promise.all an array of promises,

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:13.440 line:100% position:50% align:middle
stores promise and count promise and then
that way we will fire off both of these

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:19.080 line:100% position:50% align:middle
queries at the same time but wait for both
of them to come back because likely this

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:22.760 line:100% position:50% align:middle
one will take a little bit longer than
this one. So we have our stores.

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:27.690 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We have our count. Now what we can do is
let's just actually double check that we

00:07:27.690 --> 00:07:33.390 line:100% position:50% align:middle
have our stores coming back and maybe we
can put the count in here in the title

00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:36.780 line:100% position:50% align:middle
just to see if we have how many we have.

00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:41.100 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Here we go, 16, so we do have that count
variable coming back no problem.

00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:47.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now we can figure out how many pages there
will be so const pages is equal to and we

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:52.010 line:100% position:50% align:middle
need to take the upper limit of the number
of stores divided by how many are on per

00:07:52.010 --> 00:07:57.280 line:100% position:50% align:middle
page. So if we have the count, 16 stores,
and we have 4 per page, that is going to

00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:02.140 line:100% position:50% align:middle
give us which is our limit. So 16 divided
by 4, that's going to give us a clean 4

00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:08.410 line:100% position:50% align:middle
pages, but what if we had 17 stores? What
will we get? We would get like four and a

00:08:08.410 --> 00:08:15.250 line:100% position:50% align:middle
bit pages. So we will say math.ceil,
ceiling not like the actual animal,

00:08:15.250 --> 00:08:20.540 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and math.ceil will give us the upper bound
so if we have 17, we're going to need 5

00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:25.060 line:100% position:50% align:middle
pages because that last one is going to be
on the last page that we have there.

00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:30.240 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So that's what we have here so far.
We can now take these variables,

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:34.960 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the count variable and the pages variable
as well as the page variable and we can

00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:39.340 line:100% position:50% align:middle
pass that all along to our actual
templates. We have stores, we have page,

00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:45.600 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we have pages, and we have our count. Now
let's go back to our pagination here and

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:51.080 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we've already used these values in here.
Look at these two. These two need to have

00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:57.900 line:100% position:50% align:middle
a hash beside them. We need to now bring
that into our stores.pug file so we'll

00:08:57.900 --> 00:09:08.030 line:100% position:50% align:middle
include the mixin and then we'll use it
down below our stores and we'll pass it.

00:09:08.030 --> 00:09:13.680 line:100% position:50% align:middle
What is it expecting? Page, pages, and
count, page, pages, and count.

00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:19.050 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So that was a lot. Let's see if it works.
So we've got page 1 of 4,

00:09:19.050 --> 00:09:23.150 line:100% position:50% align:middle
16 total results, and it gives us a next.
I click on that, uh-oh,

00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:31.710 line:100% position:50% align:middle
not found. Oh, it's because our links
page, not pages, let's give that a refresh

00:09:31.710 --> 00:09:36.180 line:100% position:50% align:middle
now, page one of four, total results,
there we go, two of four,

00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:40.260 line:100% position:50% align:middle
three of four, get to the last one, we
don't have it, why? Because we have these

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:43.930 line:100% position:50% align:middle
if statements that make sure if we should
show them or not, same thing if we're on

00:09:43.930 --> 00:09:48.510 line:100% position:50% align:middle
our first page, we do not see a previous
showing up because we don't need it.

00:09:48.510 --> 00:09:52.050 line:100% position:50% align:middle
One thing is we do want to guard against
possible data changing.

00:09:52.050 --> 00:09:56.260 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So maybe somebody bookmarks that they're
on page 20, and then all of a sudden,

00:09:56.260 --> 00:10:00.010 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it doesn't work. It says page 20 of 4,
16 total results, and we don't get

00:10:00.010 --> 00:10:03.700 line:100% position:50% align:middle
anything. So what we want to do in that
case is go back to our store controller

00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:10.340 line:100% position:50% align:middle
here and right before we render out, we'll
say if there is no stores.length,

00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:18.070 line:100% position:50% align:middle
if there are no stores that have come back
and there is a skip value, then we want to

00:10:18.070 --> 00:10:25.160 line:100% position:50% align:middle
redirect them to the last page of
pagination. So we'll say request.flash

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:28.400 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we'll use info here because it's not
really a success. We'll say,

00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:34.556 line:100% position:50% align:middle
hey, you asked for page and we'll tell
them what page they asked for, but that

00:10:34.556 --> 00:10:44.279 line:100% position:50% align:middle
doesn't exist, so I put you on page...and
then we'll tell them pages,

00:10:44.279 --> 00:10:48.800 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that's the last one. So if they ask for 20
and we only have 4, we're going to say,

00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:53.230 line:100% position:50% align:middle
hey, you asked for 20 but I only put you
on page 4 because that's as far as we

00:10:53.230 --> 00:11:01.420 line:100% position:50% align:middle
can possibly go, and then we'll redirect
them to that actual page. And then finally

00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:04.790 line:100% position:50% align:middle
make sure you return from this because
we're done here. We're not actually going

00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:08.350 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to render. We're just going to redirect
them to this page which this get stores

00:11:08.350 --> 00:11:10.710 line:100% position:50% align:middle
will run again.
So give that a save and now when you

00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:14.950 line:100% position:50% align:middle
refresh a page that shouldn't exist. It
says, "Hey, you asked for page 20 but that

00:11:14.950 --> 00:11:19.280 line:100% position:50% align:middle
doesn't exist so I put you on page 4."
And then it redirected us to page four

00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:23.210 line:100% position:50% align:middle
which is the absolute last version that we
have. Let's try it one more.

00:11:23.210 --> 00:11:27.360 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Let's log in and try to do it. Now, we
deleted all of our login data so you have

00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:31.710 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to go to readme.md to find some of the
actual logins that do exist.

00:11:31.710 --> 00:11:36.900 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So let me log in as Debby Downer.
I'm going to add a new value,

00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:46.320 line:100% position:50% align:middle
going to great store,
love this place, cool.

00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:50.500 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So I added this new one, Great Store, but
if I go back to our store page,

00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:54.260 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you'll see that we now have 5 pages
with 17 total results. I don't see it

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:58.130 line:100% position:50% align:middle
here. If we go through and look for it
here it is because we're not actually

00:11:58.130 --> 00:12:02.610 line:100% position:50% align:middle
sorting our stores in any meaningful way.
So we can actually do that real quick if

00:12:02.610 --> 00:12:07.430 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we go back to our limit and take off a
semicolon and we can sort them by their

00:12:07.430 --> 00:12:11.500 line:100% position:50% align:middle
property called created, why? Because
there's a field on each of our stores

00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:16.990 line:100% position:50% align:middle
called created and we'll make that
descending. So now when I refresh my page

00:12:16.990 --> 00:12:21.120 line:100% position:50% align:middle
one, Great Store is first, why? Because
that's the latest store that I have

00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:25.910 line:100% position:50% align:middle
created whereas the last page is going to
have the oldest stores on it.

00:12:25.910 --> 00:12:29.557 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Awesome. Let's deploy this sucker.

00:12:29.557 --> 00:12:32.557 line:100% position:50% align:middle
