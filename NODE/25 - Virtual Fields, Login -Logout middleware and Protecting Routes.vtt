In this video, we're going to do a couple
things now that we actually have our user

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:18.050 line:100% position:50% align:middle
login. First of all, we're going to hook
up this LOGOUT button.

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:21.750 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Second, we're going to make the login form
work again, and third,

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.790 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we are going to create an avatar, and
fourth, when you go to the ADD page,

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:29.750 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we need to make sure that the user is
actually logged in. So, couple things

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:31.470 line:100% position:50% align:middle
going on here, but let's get started.

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.770 line:100% position:50% align:middle
First of all, LOGOUT button. We'll open up
our authController right here,

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:40.890 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and we'll make a logout method. So,
exports.logout equals request,

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:47.110 line:100% position:50% align:middle
response, and to logout you simply just
say, req.logout. That's it,

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:50.900 line:100% position:50% align:middle
then you've logged a person out. But we
also want to tell them that it worked,

00:00:50.900 --> 00:01:00.570 line:100% position:50% align:middle
so we'll say req.flash success. "You are
now logged out!". Maybe put an emoji in

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:01.500 line:100% position:50% align:middle
there.

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.800 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Good. And then, finally, we want to
redirect them, so res.redirect.

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.720 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So, we actually need to handle this. I'll
just redirect them to the homepage.

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.900 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Good. Now, we'll open up our index.js, and
if you click on this LOGOUT button,

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:19.150 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it's going to /logout and it's 404ing, so
we simply just need to make a route

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:26.830 line:100% position:50% align:middle
handler for that, router.get /logout .
We're going to say authController.logout.

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:32.290 line:100% position:50% align:middle
That should do it. So now, if I click on
LOGOUT, it says, "You are now logged out!"

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:36.420 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and it has redirected me to the homepage,
you can see that because if we take a look

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:45.460 line:100% position:50% align:middle
at our layout.js...you see in our layout,
we'll say locals.user,

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:49.230 line:100% position:50% align:middle
or user.

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:53.620 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So, if there's a user, then show them this
logged in nav. Otherwise,

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:58.140 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we show them the logged out nav. So,
that's what we have going on here.

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.360 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So there is no user being passed to all of
the templates, so it's showing us the

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.070 line:100% position:50% align:middle
logged out nav.

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:08.580 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Good. So, we have that, now we'll click on
LOG IN, and we have this happening here,

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:14.470 line:100% position:50% align:middle
but we haven't yet actually set up the
post, right? If I try sign in with

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:20.250 line:100% position:50% align:middle
wesbos@gmail.com, and I put in wes and
click LOG IN, it's going to 404.

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:29.020 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Why? Because we do have a get login, but
we do not have a post login.

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:36.840 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So, we can do that now, and just say
router.post /login, and then we simply

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.970 line:100% position:50% align:middle
just need to take our authController and
give it this login again,

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.330 line:100% position:50% align:middle
because it will handle all of the local
authentication for us.

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.790 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Super easy, I really like that. So we'll
take our authController,

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:53.930 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and we'll say login. Now, go back here,
click on LOG IN, try to login,

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:57.850 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and then, it will successfully log us in.
That's all that there is to that,

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:01.960 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you can logout. Let's try it one more time
for good old times' sake.

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:06.850 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Beautiful. Nicely logged in. So, that's
the first two pieces, logout and login.

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:10.750 line:100% position:50% align:middle
All of that stuff is baked into
passport.js, it's not anything we have to

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:14.380 line:100% position:50% align:middle
worry worry about sessions, or deleting
cookies, or anything like that.

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:20.590 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Next up, we have this avatar right here,
and if you open up the layout and look at

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:25.650 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it, we'll just search for avatar. What
we're saying is the user.gravatar.

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:29.390 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Hmm, well, first of all, if you've never
used a gravatar, it's a

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:33.400 line:100% position:50% align:middle
globally-recognized avatar and
essentially, what it does, is every single

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.268 line:100% position:50% align:middle
time that you have a user's email address,
you can actually drum up

00:03:37.268 --> 00:03:39.200 line:100% position:50% align:middle
their avatar from it.

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:43.480 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So, we're not going to actually be
handling the users uploading an image to

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.970 line:100% position:50% align:middle
here, because nobody will actually do
that. We're just going to use the built-in

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:50.800 line:100% position:50% align:middle
gravatar service, which will show us their
globally-recognized avatar.

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:54.550 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So, if you've ever signed up for a
WordPress before, then you're going to

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:59.460 line:100% position:50% align:middle
have a gravatar that sort of follows you
around throughout the entire internet,

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:04.590 line:100% position:50% align:middle
so. This gravatar property, we haven't
really done it, so let's open up our

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:10.290 line:100% position:50% align:middle
user.js model, and we don't actually need
to add a new property here called

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:16.370 line:100% position:50% align:middle
gravatar, because it can be used with
what's called a virtual field.

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:20.600 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And a virtual field in Mongoose is
essentially something that can be

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:26.610 line:100% position:50% align:middle
generated. So rather than storing all the
data about a user, sometimes your fields

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:30.980 line:100% position:50% align:middle
can be generated. For example, if you're
trying to store somebody's weight and

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:35.330 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you're storing it in kilograms, you
wouldn't also store it in pounds,

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.750 line:100% position:50% align:middle
because that can just be
generated on the fly.

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:41.470 line:100% position:50% align:middle
If you have it in one, you can convert it
to the other, no problem.

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:46.780 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Same with if you are storing miles per
hour, you can easily convert that to

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:51.380 line:100% position:50% align:middle
kilometers an hour for people that use a
sane metric system. So,

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:58.490 line:100% position:50% align:middle
all we want to do is make a virtual field
here, and I'll say userSchema.virtual,

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:03.470 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and we're going to make
the virtual gravatar.

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:05.980 line:100% position:50% align:middle
From that, we can have both get and a set
function. In our case,

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:11.470 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we only need a get function here, and
whatever you return from this function

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:14.990 line:100% position:50% align:middle
here is going to be returned from the
gravatar. So you can do something

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:22.070 line:100% position:50% align:middle
hilarious, like search for "the rock
picture." Go ahead. Images,

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:27.650 line:100% position:50% align:middle
there we go. Visit the page. Oh, no,
that's not what we want. View the image,

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:33.010 line:100% position:50% align:middle
there we go. So what we could do from here
is we could simply return the actual Rock,

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:34.200 line:100% position:50% align:middle
right?

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:37.980 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now, I refresh the page. Oh, we don't
actually see it. Let's check our layout.

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:42.170 line:100% position:50% align:middle
It's because I've put this d=retro on it.
We need that in a bit,

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:45.880 line:100% position:50% align:middle
but take that off for now. In our refresh,
you'll see The Rock showing up.

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:50.460 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Why? Because I didn't add a new field. The
Rock is not stored in the database.

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:55.170 line:100% position:50% align:middle
The Rock is just virtual and is being
pulled up via a virtual field called

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:59.970 line:100% position:50% align:middle
gravatar, and whenever you want to use
user.gravatar, it's going to generate that

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:01.980 line:100% position:50% align:middle
field sort of on the fly for us.

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:05.150 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So, that's what we want here. We're not
going to use The Rock,

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:08.660 line:100% position:50% align:middle
as awesome as he is. We are going to be
using a gravatar. Now,

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:14.340 line:100% position:50% align:middle
how do you get a gravatar? Well, a
gravatar uses a hashing algorithm called

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:19.180 line:100% position:50% align:middle
MD5, and essentially, it just takes the
user's email address and hashes it so that

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:22.230 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you're not going to leak the user's email
address in the image source,

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:26.910 line:100% position:50% align:middle
but you will show a hash of that. So, we
go up to the top here,

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:33.300 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and we've already imported our MD5
library, and from it, we'll make a hash,

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:36.960 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and we'll take md5, and you need the
user's email address.

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:41.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we say this.email, right? Because this
is going to be equal to the user,

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.430 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and then, we can access any of the
properties like email. That's why we've

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:47.740 line:100% position:50% align:middle
used a proper function here and not an
arrow function, and then,

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:59.630 line:100% position:50% align:middle
from that we are going to return backticks
and https://gravatar.com/avatar/ then this

00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:07.040 line:100% position:50% align:middle
is where you do the hash, and then
question mark, size equals 200.

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:11.470 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So, give that a refresh, and now, when we
see that , what's going to happen is a

00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:14.330 line:100% position:50% align:middle
picture of me is going to pop up, or a
picture of you is going to pop up,

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:17.650 line:100% position:50% align:middle
or if you don't have a gravatar associated
with that email address,

00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:21.880 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you'll just see like a G or some sort of
default gravatar that gets passed in,

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:30.200 line:100% position:50% align:middle
right? See this, 519c9ae? That's the MD5
hash of wesbos@gmail.com.

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:34.690 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So if I ever go to this URL here, I can
see a picture of myself,

00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:39.860 line:100% position:50% align:middle
or if you would like a huge picture of
myself, you can make it 2000.

00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:43.790 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Whoa! Too big! Too big! Too big! But you
get the point, right?

00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:49.020 line:100% position:50% align:middle
This is a URL which can be then used in an
image tag, that is auto-generated with

00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:53.040 line:100% position:50% align:middle
something that is called a virtual field.
Hey, Rock! Similarities?

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:56.490 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I think so. So, we've got that. What else
do we need? We've got our avatar,

00:07:56.490 --> 00:08:00.030 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we got our login, we got our logout. Last
thing that we need to do is...let's

00:08:00.030 --> 00:08:00.290 line:100% position:50% align:middle
logout.

00:08:00.290 --> 00:08:06.660 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now let's go to the ADD page, and you
shouldn't be able to add a store unless

00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:11.810 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you are logged in. So, what we'll do here
is we'll go back to our authController,

00:08:11.810 --> 00:08:15.750 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and we're going to make a little piece of
middleware that checks if the user is

00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:24.720 line:100% position:50% align:middle
logged in. So say exports.isLoggedIn
equals request, and response,

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:30.370 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and next, and we can check. First check if
the user is

00:08:30.370 --> 00:08:35.080 line:100% position:50% align:middle
authenticated.if(req.isAuthenticated()).

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:41.340 line:100% position:50% align:middle
That's a method there. That's not just a
property, and what that will do is it'll

00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:45.460 line:100% position:50% align:middle
check with Passport if that user is there,
and that's the beauty of using Passport

00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:48.370 line:100% position:50% align:middle
middleware, is that it puts all of these
methods on for us that we can just go

00:08:48.370 --> 00:08:52.380 line:100% position:50% align:middle
ahead and use. And if that is true, then
next(), we'll just say,

00:08:52.380 --> 00:09:00.540 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"carry on! They are logged in!" Otherwise,
we can return here.

00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:05.290 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We're going to req.flash error.

00:09:05.290 --> 00:09:09.690 line:100% position:50% align:middle
It'll say, "Oops you must be logged in,"
then we'll redirect them to the login

00:09:09.690 --> 00:09:15.240 line:100% position:50% align:middle
page.res.redirect. Good. So, we just made
a little piece of middleware...

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:19.040 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Oops! Arrow function. We made a little
piece of middleware here that says if they

00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:23.230 line:100% position:50% align:middle
are authenticated, then continue on the
middleware path, otherwise,

00:09:23.230 --> 00:09:27.270 line:100% position:50% align:middle
stop it right there, tell them that they
must be logged in, and show them the

00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:31.730 line:100% position:50% align:middle
actual login page. So we can take this
isLoggedIn middleware, go back to our

00:09:31.730 --> 00:09:37.620 line:100% position:50% align:middle
routes, find this route, which
is /add right here.

00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:41.180 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Oh, no that's our post. This is our add,
and before we show them the ADD STORE

00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:46.580 line:100% position:50% align:middle
form, we're simply going to take our
authController and give them the

00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:54.740 line:100% position:50% align:middle
isLoggedIn, and then move them on to
addStore. So, you will never make it past

00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:58.290 line:100% position:50% align:middle
this middleware unless we're logged in. If
we are, then we'll make it to the second

00:09:58.290 --> 00:10:02.100 line:100% position:50% align:middle
piece of middleware in the stack. So now,
if I go back to ADD,

00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:05.310 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it tells me, "Oops you must be logged in
to do that!" and brings me to the login

00:10:05.310 --> 00:10:08.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
page, so I cannot go to the ADD page.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:14.500 line:100% position:50% align:middle
But if I do login, then I go to ADD, it
shows me the ADD page because I'm logged

00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:20.730 line:100% position:50% align:middle
in, right? Couple little goodies in there.
Let's move on to doing the user accounts

00:10:20.730 --> 00:10:21.526 line:100% position:50% align:middle
screen.

00:10:21.526 --> 00:10:24.526 line:100% position:50% align:middle
