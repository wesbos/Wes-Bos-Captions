00:00:11.538 --> 00:00:13.056 line:100% position:50% align:middle
All right, now we're
going to be working

00:00:13.056 --> 00:00:16.960 line:100% position:50% align:middle
with this Top page, this is the answer
that I've got here, and we're going to get

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:23.441 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the list of top 10 stores based on their
average rating. So, huh, this is going to

00:00:23.441 --> 00:00:28.997 line:100% position:50% align:middle
get a little bit complex because how do
you query stores based on something that

00:00:28.997 --> 00:00:30.903 line:100% position:50% align:middle
each store doesn't even have?

00:00:30.903 --> 00:00:34.317 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We have reviews and we have
stores, and they're kind of

00:00:34.317 --> 00:00:40.010 line:100% position:50% align:middle
related because we have those fields, but
we don't actually have the data of reviews

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:44.570 line:100% position:50% align:middle
in the stores. So what we need to do, and
this is a perfect use case for an

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:49.080 line:100% position:50% align:middle
aggregation. Remember, an aggregation is
what you use in MongoDB whenever you need

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:54.444 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to do either multi-stepped or very complex
queries. So in this case, we want to grab

00:00:54.444 --> 00:00:58.207 line:100% position:50% align:middle
a list of all of our stores, populate
their ratings, and then find out what the

00:00:58.207 --> 00:01:01.052 line:100% position:50% align:middle
average rating of that
actual store is.

00:01:01.052 --> 00:01:03.788 line:100% position:50% align:middle
But then, I also don't want
to show stores that only

00:01:03.788 --> 00:01:07.640 line:100% position:50% align:middle
have one rating because one person could
rate it five stars and they go right to

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:12.860 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the top, right? So let's open up our...or
let's go back to our actual application

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.090 line:100% position:50% align:middle
here, click on Top, we get a 404. So
we'll go to our index, search as, and

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:18.430 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we'll make a route for that top.

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:26.060 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So, go down to here. So
router.get/top, and when that

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.710 line:100% position:50% align:middle
happens, we are going to catch the errors
and we'll use our storeController

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:36.090 line:100% position:50% align:middle
getTopStores, okay? And we'll open up
our storeController here,

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:42.030 line:100% position:50% align:middle
go down to the bottom.
exports.getTopStores = async.

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.940 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Request response. I feel really sad, this
is the last method we're going to be

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:49.850 line:100% position:50% align:middle
building together, and then you're
a little butterfly out on your own.

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.720 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So here we go. So we're going to say
const stores = ...oh, wait,

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:03.230 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Store dot...what do I do here? Find? No,
no. What we're going to do is we're going

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:09.050 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to make up a new method called getTop
Stores, then we're going to render out a

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:16.190 line:100% position:50% align:middle
TopStores.pug file, then the stores are
going to be passed and the title is going

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.933 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to be "Top Stores!"

00:02:16.933 --> 00:02:22.870 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Okay, so this getTopStores
right here, how do we actually do that?

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:27.760 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Well, as a general rule of thumb, any time
I have a complex query,

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:32.800 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it's not great to do that inside of your
controller. It's best to put that on the

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:37.120 line:100% position:50% align:middle
model itself. It's fine to do like a find,
and you have a couple little queries here

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.120 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and there, but whenever we're going to get
into like seven, eight lines of querying

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.290 line:100% position:50% align:middle
in our aggregation, I like to stick that
in my model. Keep it as close to the model

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:51.100 line:100% position:50% align:middle
as you can without making it a rule that
you follow blindly.

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:56.381 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we'll open up our store model,
store.js, and we'll go down to the bottom.

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:59.770 line:100% position:50% align:middle
You see here, we have storeSchema.statics
that didn't get TagsList.

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:03.440 line:100% position:50% align:middle
That's exactly what we're going to be
doing, but we're going to be getting one

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.700 line:100% position:50% align:middle
called getTopStores. So we can put it
below and the order here doesn't really

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.330 line:100% position:50% align:middle
matter, but as long as you have it on
before you create your model.

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:20.520 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Just say storeSchema.statics.getTopStores.
And that's = function,

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:23.900 line:100% position:50% align:middle
proper function because we're going to
need this in just a second.

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:30.480 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Open that up. Now, from that, we are going
to return this .aggregate and you pass it

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.840 line:100% position:50% align:middle
in array. So what that will do is, again,
aggregate is like a query function.

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:39.470 line:100% position:50% align:middle
It's much like .find, except we can do
much more complex stuff inside of it.

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:43.160 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And by returning that, that means it's
going to return the promise so that we can

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:48.030 line:100% position:50% align:middle
await the result of getTopStores and put
it into our actual variable there.

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:53.180 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So that's why we have that. Now, I have...
I'm going to paste in some things that we

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:56.680 line:100% position:50% align:middle
need to do here, because I want to like
get an idea of what we're doing beforehand

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.800 line:100% position:50% align:middle
rather than just blindly
following the typing.

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:04.060 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So paste this in. First what we want to do
is look up stores and populate their

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:04.565 line:100% position:50% align:middle
reviews.

00:04:04.565 --> 00:04:08.519 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Okay, so first thing first, is that we
can't actually use our virtual reviews

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:15.530 line:100% position:50% align:middle
here because this virtual reviews is a
Mongoose-specific thing and this aggregate

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:20.360 line:100% position:50% align:middle
is not Mongoose-specific, it just passes
it right through to MongoDB.

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:25.790 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So sort of a downside to some of these
convenience methods in Mongoose is that

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:30.495 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you can't use them every possible place
because if you're doing something like

00:04:30.495 --> 00:04:35.060 line:100% position:50% align:middle
aggregate, it doesn't know about...this is
a lower level MongoDB function,

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:38.760 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it doesn't know about these higher-level
Mongoose things, it's just MongoDB.

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:43.950 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we need to do something similar to what
we did here with our virtual but we need

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:49.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to look up the stores. Then once we have a
list of stores which each store has their

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:55.020 line:100% position:50% align:middle
reviews populated, we want to filter for
stores that only have two or more reviews,

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:59.580 line:100% position:50% align:middle
right? So we first need to get the stores,
then populate the reviews, then figure out

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:04.240 line:100% position:50% align:middle
if they have two or more reviews because
we don't want to show stores that have one

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:09.580 line:100% position:50% align:middle
review. Then we want to add a new field
called average reviews because we don't

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:13.330 line:100% position:50% align:middle
know what the average review is of each
store and that's something that needs to

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:16.940 line:100% position:50% align:middle
be calculated on the fly, and that's
exactly what aggregation is for.

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:20.850 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Finally, we want to sort by our new field,
highest reviews first.

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:24.200 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we want to put the people at the...
the highest review at the top. And then,

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:27.720 line:100% position:50% align:middle
finally, if we have more than 10,
we'll limit it to actually having 10.

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:32.910 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So you see sort of what an aggregation is
for, many steps of a complex query.

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:36.590 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So first thing first, each one of these
steps is going to be an object.

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:40.280 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So first of all, what we're going to do is
called a lookup and a lookup will populate

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:47.780 line:100% position:50% align:middle
a field that is sort of like our virtuals.
So we want to look up from reviews, and

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:56.230 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I'll talk about that in a second. Our
localField is going to be the id.

00:05:56.230 --> 00:06:04.640 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Our foreignField is store, just like we
did down here. And we're going to say as:

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:09.195 line:100% position:50% align:middle
reviews, and that's what the
actual field is going to be called.

00:06:09.195 --> 00:06:12.910 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So that's pretty much the same thing here,
we made a field called reviews where you

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:17.500 line:100% position:50% align:middle
have a foreignField and a localField.
The only difference here is that our from

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:22.760 line:100% position:50% align:middle
is reviews, and down we did ref =
Reviews. And this, like,

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:26.660 line:100% position:50% align:middle
took me the longest time to figure out. I
was like, "Where is this coming from?" I

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:29.800 line:100% position:50% align:middle
was looking at all these examples and I'm
like, "I don't understand," like this is

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:35.710 line:100% position:50% align:middle
nowhere in my actual review model. But
what actually happens is that MongoDB will

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:41.140 line:100% position:50% align:middle
lower-case it and put an S on the end for
you. So it will take your model name,

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:45.670 line:100% position:50% align:middle
which is Review, and it will lower-
case it and add an S onto the end.

00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:49.600 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So just so you know that, that's something
that tripped me up for a while,

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:51.070 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the comma, that's the first thing.

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:54.150 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Actually, we can sort of like follow along
as we're doing this.

00:06:54.150 --> 00:07:00.080 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So let's save that so far and let's go...
oh, I have a bit of an error here,

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:05.930 line:100% position:50% align:middle
our lookup needs to be an object in
itself. This stuff sometimes gets a little

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:09.520 line:100% position:50% align:middle
bit hairy. If it's looking a little bit
complicated for you, you can put it on its

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:15.830 line:100% position:50% align:middle
own line where the lookup has its own
values being pulled in but I can put it on

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:21.570 line:100% position:50% align:middle
its own line. So we have two objects, the
first one being the aggregation line, and

00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:25.960 line:100% position:50% align:middle
then we lookup and then we pass it a
second object for the lookup.

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:28.560 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So give that a save, we'll go back to
our storeController here.

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:32.220 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And instead of rendering, let's just do a
JSON so we can see if our stores are

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:38.070 line:100% position:50% align:middle
working. There we go, now what we have
here is we've got a ton of data being

00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:43.890 line:100% position:50% align:middle
passed back. Well, we have a list of all
of our stores and each store has a Reviews

00:07:43.890 --> 00:07:48.280 line:100% position:50% align:middle
field which has a list of all the reviews
for that specific store,

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:54.097 line:100% position:50% align:middle
right? And that's exactly what this is,
as... I could say as: WESISCOOL.

00:07:56.705 --> 00:08:00.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And now the field is actually called
WESISCOOL because I did it like that.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.720 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So that's how we name what the field is,
this is where we get it from,

00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:07.990 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Review. And then this is how we link the
two. So what we did there is we took two

00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:12.058 line:100% position:50% align:middle
separate documents, our store documents
and our reviews documents, and we merged

00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:12.940 line:100% position:50% align:middle
them together.

00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:16.650 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now what we want to do is take this data
and whittle it down a little bit because

00:08:16.650 --> 00:08:20.740 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we don't want everything, we just want to
filter for items that only have two or

00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:25.360 line:100% position:50% align:middle
more reviews. So we're going to use a
match in the next one. So make sure you

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:30.900 line:100% position:50% align:middle
put a comma after that last one,
$match. So out of this last one,

00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:35.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we're piping it in here and we're going to
whittle it down by matching,

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:42.770 line:100% position:50% align:middle
which is an object, only ones that have a
reviews.1 and another object here,

00:08:42.770 --> 00:08:48.090 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we're going to say $exists: true. So,
woo, what? So we're going to match

00:08:48.090 --> 00:08:53.690 line:100% position:50% align:middle
documents where reviews.1, this is
how you access things that are index-based

00:08:53.690 --> 00:08:57.580 line:100% position:50% align:middle
in MongoDB, so reviews.0 would be the
first thing, reviews.1.

00:08:57.580 --> 00:09:00.080 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I know we don't have that in JavaScript,
but that's how we do it in MongoDB.

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:07.160 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we want to say it like where the second
item in reviews exists is true, and what

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:11.230 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that will do is that'll just whittle it
down. So places that only have one review

00:09:11.230 --> 00:09:16.390 line:100% position:50% align:middle
will be totally taken out of it. So here,
this one has absolutely no reviews.

00:09:16.390 --> 00:09:19.940 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Most of them actually have no reviews,
we'll look at populating some extra data

00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:24.360 line:100% position:50% align:middle
in just a second. So give that a save, and
now I've only got this one store coming

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:28.730 line:100% position:50% align:middle
back because that's all the actual data we
have. So we need to pause this for just a

00:09:28.730 --> 00:09:30.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
second because we need more data.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:35.630 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And remember, we had this file here in our
data folder called load-sample-data.

00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:42.220 line:100% position:50% align:middle
What we can do now is we can go back and
load in, uncomment, these one,

00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:49.560 line:100% position:50% align:middle
two, three, and four, sorry, at the top,
there's a fourth one. So uncomment those

00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:55.590 line:100% position:50% align:middle
four things we commented out previously,
and let's go back to our terminal here.

00:09:55.590 --> 00:09:58.966 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Kill it, and we're going to run the
script, well, let's look at our

00:09:58.966 --> 00:10:00.310 line:100% position:50% align:middle
package.json.

00:10:00.310 --> 00:10:03.572 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We're going to run the script, blow it
all the way, because that's going to

00:10:03.572 --> 00:10:08.255 line:100% position:50% align:middle
delete all of our current stores and load
into new ones. So, npm run blowitallaway.

00:10:11.594 --> 00:10:15.460 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And that deleted all of
our data. So now we should have no actual

00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:21.890 line:100% position:50% align:middle
data, go back to MongoDB and refresh this.
There are no reviews, there are no stores,

00:10:21.890 --> 00:10:26.510 line:100% position:50% align:middle
there are no users. Then we can run our
data, which is called sample,

00:10:26.510 --> 00:10:28.725 line:100% position:50% align:middle
npm run sample.

00:10:32.101 --> 00:10:35.280 line:100% position:50% align:middle
That loaded a whole bunch
of data in for us, going to clear it out.

00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:37.278 line:100% position:50% align:middle
npm start, once more.

00:10:42.235 --> 00:10:47.890 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And now if I refresh this page, we're
getting all kinds of data coming back and

00:10:47.890 --> 00:10:52.290 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you can also see if you go to the actual
website, we got all of our stores back,

00:10:52.290 --> 00:10:56.300 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and then each of our stores should now
have a bunch of, here we go,

00:10:56.300 --> 00:11:00.901 line:100% position:50% align:middle
bunch of reviews being popped up in the
bottom as we see it there.

00:11:00.901 --> 00:11:03.950 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Good, so we have some data. Let's go back
to that end point, which is /top.

00:11:03.950 --> 00:11:09.180 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Let's keep working on our aggregation
here in store.js. We want to add a new

00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:13.551 line:100% position:50% align:middle
field for the average rating. So that's
like we don't have an actual average

00:11:13.551 --> 00:11:14.786 line:100% position:50% align:middle
rating just yet.

00:11:14.786 --> 00:11:18.226 line:100% position:50% align:middle
In order for us to sort by the
average rating, that field needs to be

00:11:18.226 --> 00:11:23.660 line:100% position:50% align:middle
correct, that field needs to be created
first. So give yourselves an object here,

00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:27.468 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and we are going to use the $project and
what is $project? $project means,

00:11:27.468 --> 00:11:30.057 line:100% position:50% align:middle
essentially, like, add a
field to the actual one.

00:11:30.057 --> 00:11:31.754 line:100% position:50% align:middle
There's a little bit of
a downside to this,

00:11:31.754 --> 00:11:35.950 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and I'll explain that in just a second. So
we are going to $project and this is going

00:11:35.950 --> 00:11:40.600 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to be an object itself. Put it on its own
line here, and we're going to $project an

00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:47.401 line:100% position:50% align:middle
average rating property, and the value of
that is going to be set to the average

00:11:47.401 --> 00:11:54.520 line:100% position:50% align:middle
$avg of $reviews.rating. So what it's
saying here is that, create a new field

00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:59.330 line:100% position:50% align:middle
called averageRating and set the value of
that to be the average of each of the

00:11:59.330 --> 00:12:04.860 line:100% position:50% align:middle
review's rating field, and it's going to
do the actual math for us.

00:12:04.860 --> 00:12:09.260 line:100% position:50% align:middle
The same we also have some as we have all
these operators that will do math against

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:10.030 line:100% position:50% align:middle
fields.

00:12:10.030 --> 00:12:16.140 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And the dollar sign means that it is a
field from the data being piped in,

00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:20.070 line:100% position:50% align:middle
in our case, it's being piped in from our
match. So if I give that a refresh,

00:12:20.070 --> 00:12:23.880 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we should see averageRating show up now.
There we go, we've got averageRating

00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:30.920 line:100% position:50% align:middle
five, one, three, four, two, three, but
what happened to the rest of our data?

00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:35.790 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now, this is the weird thing about
aggregations, is currently I'm actually

00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:42.560 line:100% position:50% align:middle
running MongoDB 3.2 in mLab. Here I've got
my mLab open and I was just showing you

00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:45.520 line:100% position:50% align:middle
here when you create a new sandbox, at
least when I'm recording this,

00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:51.620 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I don't have a MongoDB version 3.4. And
version 3.4 will just have this thing

00:12:51.620 --> 00:12:56.290 line:100% position:50% align:middle
called $addField, and then that's all you
need. And it's going to take your existing

00:12:56.290 --> 00:13:01.533 line:100% position:50% align:middle
document and just add a new field to it,
right? But with MongoDB 3.2,

00:13:01.533 --> 00:13:06.540 line:100% position:50% align:middle
if you're on that version, and the way you
can you can tell what version you're on is

00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:10.720 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you can always go to your MongoDB Compass
and it will tell you what version of

00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:18.970 line:100% position:50% align:middle
MongoDB you're on. See, 3.2.1.2. So what
can we do about this? Well, we can either

00:13:18.970 --> 00:13:24.520 line:100% position:50% align:middle
upgrade MongoDB 3.4, or if you're on mLab
and you don't have that option just yet,

00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:27.410 line:100% position:50% align:middle
or maybe it is by the time
you're watching this, we have to go back

00:13:27.410 --> 00:13:32.470 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to $project. And you have to add all the
fields back in that you explicitly want.

00:13:32.470 --> 00:13:36.250 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So that's fine, because we only need a
couple of pieces here. We need the photo,

00:13:36.250 --> 00:13:40.470 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we need the name, we need the reviews, or
at least the count of the reviews,

00:13:40.470 --> 00:13:41.310 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and that's it.

00:13:41.310 --> 00:13:45.380 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we can do that, no problem. We'll say
photo = and here you can take

00:13:45.380 --> 00:13:49.610 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the $$ROOT variable, which is
going to be...that's going to be the equal

00:13:49.610 --> 00:13:53.320 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to the original document.photo,
and there we go. There's our...our photo

00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:59.830 line:100% position:50% align:middle
is back, and what else do we need? We
need the name and we need the reviews and

00:13:59.830 --> 00:14:04.510 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we need the reviews. And there we go,
we've got our...id always comes with you,

00:14:04.510 --> 00:14:07.680 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the name, the photo, a list of
reviews, and our average rating.

00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:11.220 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we just sort of like created our own
new document, and that's exactly what

00:14:11.220 --> 00:14:15.780 line:100% position:50% align:middle
aggregations are for. So we've got that up
and running. Next we'll need to sort it by

00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:19.620 line:100% position:50% align:middle
our new field. So, again, put
a comma after the last one,

00:14:19.620 --> 00:14:25.010 line:100% position:50% align:middle
give yourself a new object, and we are
going to sort based on what? Well,

00:14:25.010 --> 00:14:28.245 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it's going to be averageRating. Why?
Because that's our last one. And then you

00:14:28.245 --> 00:14:30.123 line:100% position:50% align:middle
either tell a -1 or a 1.

00:14:30.123 --> 00:14:32.084 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we want -1
because we want to go

00:14:32.084 --> 00:14:38.950 line:100% position:50% align:middle
highest to lowest. Now, at the top, our
averageRating is five right here,

00:14:38.950 --> 00:14:45.530 line:100% position:50% align:middle
go all the way to the bottom. Our
averageRating is 1.6. So we've got those,

00:14:45.530 --> 00:14:50.280 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and then finally, limit this to at most
10. Why? Because how many items are coming

00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:54.100 line:100% position:50% align:middle
back? We've got one, two, three, four.
We've got a lot, 15 or so.

00:14:54.100 --> 00:14:59.550 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we want to limit it to at most 10.
So, again, we'll pipe it into our next

00:14:59.550 --> 00:15:06.114 line:100% position:50% align:middle
operator, $limit: 10. That one luckily
doesn't have a nested object in it.

00:15:06.830 --> 00:15:10.883 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now we're getting 10 back, you
can test that by make it 1.

00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:16.619 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And you see, you only get one back. So
this will give us at least or at the most

00:15:16.619 --> 00:15:20.563 line:100% position:50% align:middle
10. Good, so that...woo, that was a
massive aggregation that we have used

00:15:20.563 --> 00:15:21.635 line:100% position:50% align:middle
here.

00:15:21.635 --> 00:15:25.197 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We had to do some weird stuff around
$project, but if you are on MongoDB

00:15:25.197 --> 00:15:30.639 line:100% position:50% align:middle
3.4, you can just use addField and not
have to do any of these extra three lines

00:15:30.639 --> 00:15:31.880 line:100% position:50% align:middle
of code here.

00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:35.520 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Good, then we'll go back into our
storeController and we don't actually

00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:40.770 line:100% position:50% align:middle
want to JSON it, we want to render out
TopStores, which we're going to make a new

00:15:40.770 --> 00:15:45.638 line:100% position:50% align:middle
view for it, call it topStores.pug,
capital S. And we'll give ourselves our

00:15:45.638 --> 00:15:48.904 line:100% position:50% align:middle
.inner, we will give ourselves h2.

00:15:48.904 --> 00:15:52.113 line:100% position:50% align:middle
You'll say Top,
how many stores?

00:15:52.113 --> 00:15:57.195 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Well, we can interpellate this data here,
we just take the number of stores and get

00:15:57.195 --> 00:16:01.605 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the length, stores. Get that to
save. Now when we refresh this page,

00:16:01.605 --> 00:16:06.950 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we see top 10 stores, and if we were to
change the amount of stores that were

00:16:06.950 --> 00:16:12.578 line:100% position:50% align:middle
coming back, limit it to 5, that should
just update this to top 5 stores.

00:16:13.390 --> 00:16:17.620 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Beautiful! And that will also work if you
only actually have six stores in your

00:16:17.620 --> 00:16:22.730 line:100% position:50% align:middle
database, it's only going to give you six.
So we have our top stores, then we need to

00:16:22.730 --> 00:16:28.510 line:100% position:50% align:middle
actually code up a table here. So
table.table, thead. It's been years

00:16:28.510 --> 00:16:35.020 line:100% position:50% align:middle
since I've coded a table. And we need a
photo, a ranking, a name,

00:16:35.020 --> 00:16:42.060 line:100% position:50% align:middle
a number of reviews, and an average
rating. Okay, all those don't need to all

00:16:42.060 --> 00:16:49.480 line:100% position:50% align:middle
be on their own line. And each of them is
going to be a td. Then we can loop over

00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:55.300 line:100% position:50% align:middle
each of the stores here,
so each store, i in stores.

00:16:55.300 --> 00:16:59.920 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So in this case, we also need the index,
so we say store, i, and that's going to

00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:04.240 line:100% position:50% align:middle
give us one, two, three, four, five. And
for each of those we need a table row and

00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:08.940 line:100% position:50% align:middle
then a td inside of that. We need
an image with a width of 200,

00:17:08.940 --> 00:17:16.260 line:100% position:50% align:middle
a source of, then we'll do our uploads/.
You could probably make a nice

00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:19.210 line:100% position:50% align:middle
little helper. We've coded this whole
uploads thing a couple times.

00:17:19.210 --> 00:17:23.270 line:100% position:50% align:middle
It'd be nice to have a helper function to
do this for us rather than have to code it

00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:30.585 line:100% position:50% align:middle
every single time in our template.
store.photo or store.png.

00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:34.930 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And then the alt of that will be the
store.name. So let's give that a save,

00:17:34.930 --> 00:17:41.280 line:100% position:50% align:middle
refresh. We've got our top 10 stores being
piped in here, and if you inspect it,

00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:44.250 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it's going to alt="Charred" and it's
giving our actual photo, good.

00:17:44.250 --> 00:17:47.740 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we've got that up and running. Now feel
free to pause the video and just do the

00:17:47.740 --> 00:17:52.542 line:100% position:50% align:middle
rest yourself. It's simply just
templating out some data.

00:17:52.542 --> 00:17:58.710 line:100% position:50% align:middle
td is going to be =, our td will
have the i, but if we just use i, it's

00:17:58.710 --> 00:18:00.523 line:100% position:50% align:middle
going to actually start at zero.

00:18:00.523 --> 00:18:03.441 line:100% position:50% align:middle
It's ranking zero and we
actually want it to start at

00:18:03.441 --> 00:18:08.990 line:100% position:50% align:middle
one. We'll index it by one. We have a td,
inside of that, we have an a. And

00:18:08.990 --> 00:18:12.337 line:100% position:50% align:middle
by the way, if you do this, like td:,
you're able to do it on one line,

00:18:12.337 --> 00:18:14.216 line:100% position:50% align:middle
otherwise, you have to
indent it like that.

00:18:14.216 --> 00:18:23.057 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So td: a, the href is going to be
= /stores/store.slug. Again,

00:18:23.057 --> 00:18:26.960 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you could also make that a nice little
helper function that would generate the

00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:32.210 line:100% position:50% align:middle
URL given the store.slug. And then inside
of that, we'll have a store.name.

00:18:32.210 --> 00:18:37.540 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Looking good, looking good. Finally, we
have a td, which is going to have the

00:18:37.540 --> 00:18:41.810 line:100% position:50% align:middle
store.averageRating inside of it.
That's not going to do much for us,

00:18:41.810 --> 00:18:45.950 line:100% position:50% align:middle
but we can see, looks good. But the
problem is that when we only have values

00:18:45.950 --> 00:18:50.700 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that look like this. So what we need to do
is to round it in so that we can get

00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:55.540 line:100% position:50% align:middle
something like 4.3 out of 5. So how do we
do that? Well, wrap that whole thing in

00:18:55.540 --> 00:19:03.840 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Math.round. Multiply that by 10, then
divide it by 10, and what will that give

00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:09.130 line:100% position:50% align:middle
us? There we go, 4.3. So what we did was
we just bumped up the decimal,

00:19:09.130 --> 00:19:13.090 line:100% position:50% align:middle
rounded it, then bumped down the decimal,
and we get a nice little quick number.

00:19:13.090 --> 00:19:17.990 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And then we can just put an out-of-five on
the end to just show us what we've got.

00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:21.990 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Good, so we have all this up and running,
click it. We probably should wrap our

00:19:21.990 --> 00:19:29.560 line:100% position:50% align:middle
img tag in a link as well, so we'll do
td: a(href from the other one.

00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:36.460 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Oh, no! What did I do? Maybe I can't mix
these. So td, a, img all nested inside,

00:19:36.460 --> 00:19:40.747 line:100% position:50% align:middle
there we go. Now when I click on one of
them...oh, no! It doesn't put in the

00:19:40.747 --> 00:19:44.552 line:100% position:50% align:middle
store.slug. Oh, why is that?

00:19:44.552 --> 00:19:46.468 line:100% position:50% align:middle
When you click on
them we get undefined because we didn't

00:19:46.468 --> 00:19:50.790 line:100% position:50% align:middle
ask for the store.slug when we made our
aggregation. Remember,

00:19:50.790 --> 00:19:56.130 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we had this problem here? We also need to
ask for the slug value, then I click

00:19:56.130 --> 00:19:56.600 line:100% position:50% align:middle
on one.

00:19:56.600 --> 00:20:00.570 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now I got the French, oh, and finally,
I am messing up all over the place.

00:20:00.570 --> 00:20:08.330 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I think it's S and S. Again,
if I had a nice little helper function for

00:20:08.330 --> 00:20:12.550 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that, I wouldn't screw that up every
single time that I actually wrote it.

00:20:12.550 --> 00:20:15.620 line:100% position:50% align:middle
There we go, we actually get to
see what charred looks like. Good,

00:20:15.620 --> 00:20:21.030 line:100% position:50% align:middle
so that is our actual aggregation for the
top stores. Really, the last thing that we

00:20:21.030 --> 00:20:26.130 line:100% position:50% align:middle
want to do here is also when somebody
views a store, we want to show them how

00:20:26.130 --> 00:20:31.753 line:100% position:50% align:middle
many reviews are on that specific store.
If we open up our storeCard.pug

00:20:31.753 --> 00:20:34.130 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and we're looking for something like
this, this is the answer here.

00:20:34.130 --> 00:20:38.300 line:100% position:50% align:middle
If it has four views, I want it to show
a little four right beside it, etc., etc.

00:20:38.300 --> 00:20:42.620 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So if we open up our storeCard.pug,
and we do a quick dump of our store,

00:20:42.620 --> 00:20:47.030 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you'll see that each of the stores
actually doesn't have a reviews.

00:20:47.030 --> 00:20:51.710 line:100% position:50% align:middle
It's set to null and the reason is because
we have not yet called populate on every

00:20:51.710 --> 00:20:55.920 line:100% position:50% align:middle
single time that we want it. So if we go
back to our storeController and look for

00:20:55.920 --> 00:21:01.780 line:100% position:50% align:middle
getStores, and you see that we have
Store.find, and we could call it .populate

00:21:01.780 --> 00:21:05.780 line:100% position:50% align:middle
on the end, and we ask for
reviews field to be populated.

00:21:05.780 --> 00:21:09.420 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now, if I refresh that, all the reviews
are being populated, no problem.

00:21:09.420 --> 00:21:14.430 line:100% position:50% align:middle
You see, bok, bok, bok, all of these
things. But I don't feel like doing that

00:21:14.430 --> 00:21:18.330 line:100% position:50% align:middle
every single time that I need it, so we
could use our autopopulate function that

00:21:18.330 --> 00:21:20.740 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we've done for our other one.

00:21:20.740 --> 00:21:25.402 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we'll go into our store.js, we will
find...make a function called

00:21:25.402 --> 00:21:26.792 line:100% position:50% align:middle
autopopulate.

00:21:26.792 --> 00:21:30.480 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Next, I'm going to say this.populate. What
do we want to populate?

00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:36.970 line:100% position:50% align:middle
The reviews, next. And then we take
our schema and we run our hooks, so we'll

00:21:36.970 --> 00:21:43.310 line:100% position:50% align:middle
say storeSchema.pre('find'. We're going to
autopopulate. And then we also want to do,

00:21:43.310 --> 00:21:48.540 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we need to do findOne. And that means
whenever I query a store, it should also

00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:53.190 line:100% position:50% align:middle
populate all of the reviews for that
store. Here we go, showing up just fine,

00:21:53.190 --> 00:21:58.330 line:100% position:50% align:middle
go back to our storeCard here, you can get
rid of that dump. And we'll go down here.

00:21:58.330 --> 00:22:05.820 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We have our storeCard heart, we have our
storeCard edit. Let's do another one down

00:22:05.820 --> 00:22:14.160 line:100% position:50% align:middle
here. We'll say if store.reviews,
store__action.store__action--count.

00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:18.370 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I'm going to do another one of those,
h.icon. We look for the review

00:22:18.370 --> 00:22:22.410 line:100% position:50% align:middle
icon, and below that, we'll just give
ourselves the span with the

00:22:22.410 --> 00:22:29.130 line:100% position:50% align:middle
store.reviews.length. So the number of
reviews that are specifically on that.

00:22:29.130 --> 00:22:32.510 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So give that a refresh, there we go, and
now we see the number of reviews popping

00:22:32.510 --> 00:22:36.880 line:100% position:50% align:middle
up for every single one of our reviews.
And if we go to our Tags page,

00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:40.420 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you can click on any of the tags, you see
how that's always getting populated

00:22:40.420 --> 00:22:43.570 line:100% position:50% align:middle
regardless of what query you were doing?
We didn't have to update six or seven

00:22:43.570 --> 00:22:46.122 line:100% position:50% align:middle
queries, it's just going to be
autopopulated every single time.

00:22:46.122 --> 00:22:48.874 line:100% position:50% align:middle
