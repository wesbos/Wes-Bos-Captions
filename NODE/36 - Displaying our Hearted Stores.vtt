Now, when you click on your Heart icon,
we get a 404, and that's because we don't

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:19.090 line:100% position:50% align:middle
have a route for that. But when you do
visit this page, we do want to query the

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:22.260 line:100% position:50% align:middle
stores that are in our hearts. There's a
couple different ways you can go about

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.860 line:100% position:50% align:middle
this, and I encourage you to pause the
video and actually try this one on your

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:29.486 line:100% position:50% align:middle
own, because it's all stuff,
pretty much, that we've done so far.

00:00:29.486 --> 00:00:36.880 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So let's open up our index.js for our
routes, and let's add a new route for

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:41.420 line:100% position:50% align:middle
getting our stores. So I'll say,
"router.get". I'm going to look for

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:46.760 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"hearts," and we're going to use
the Store Controller, ".getHearts".

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.450 line:100% position:50% align:middle
That's actually going to be [in a sink].
So I'll wrap that sucker in catchErrors.

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:56.830 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Good. Next up, what we want to do
is open up our Store Controller.

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:03.726 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Again, go to the bottom, make a new
method called "exports.getHearts".

00:01:03.726 --> 00:01:07.590 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now, there's actually two ways we can
go ahead in finding all of these stores.

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.580 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We could either query the current user
and call ".populate" on their hearts.

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:15.970 line:100% position:50% align:middle
What that will do is it will just get the
user, and it will populate all of the

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:23.580 line:100% position:50% align:middle
hearts. Or we can query a bunch of stores
and find those stores whose ID are in our

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.640 line:100% position:50% align:middle
current heart array. What?
Let's try it. Let's do the second way.

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:32.400 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We've done the first way already.
We have already populated fields that

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.470 line:100% position:50% align:middle
were a relationship. But we haven't
done where an ID is in an array.

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:39.680 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So what we're going to do is we're
going to say, "const stores = await" our

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:46.550 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"Store.find". And our query is going to be
an object. It's kind of pretty interesting

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:54.440 line:100% position:50% align:middle
what we have here. We're going to say,
"where the ID property of the store is in

00:01:54.440 --> 00:02:01.080 line:100% position:50% align:middle
req.user.hearts". So what that will do is
it will find any stores where their ID is

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:06.140 line:100% position:50% align:middle
in an array, which is req.user.hearts.
That's pretty neat, because then it will

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.090 line:100% position:50% align:middle
look in the array for us and find
all of the stores that we have.

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.970 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So once we have that, let's just res.json
the actual list of stores that we have

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:18.440 line:100% position:50% align:middle
here, and we get a huge array of stores
that I've hearted. Good. So what we can do

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.490 line:100% position:50% align:middle
is just take that list of stores and
pass it off to our store's URL.

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:26.400 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we'll say, "res.render" and we
have a Stores layout already.

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.100 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We don't need to make a new Pug file
for this. The title is going to be

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:36.680 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"Hearted Stores" and we need to pass
along our stores, which we just found.

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.960 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Again, we can just pass that as "stores".
Good. So I give that a save and refresh.

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:44.820 line:100% position:50% align:middle
That's it. That's the end of this
tutorial. All we really have to do is

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:49.790 line:100% position:50% align:middle
reuse our homepage layout, but do a
different query where we want to find the

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:53.830 line:100% position:50% align:middle
actual stores that we have here. One thing
is if you open this up an Incognito

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:59.110 line:100% position:50% align:middle
window, we actually get an error here,
because we're trying to find the

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:04.580 line:100% position:50% align:middle
req.user.hearts, and "user" doesn't exist.
So what we really want to do here is put

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:07.960 line:100% position:50% align:middle
a little bit of a middleware that will
double-check if the person is actually

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:12.230 line:100% position:50% align:middle
logged in before... Because they
can't click on this in the URL.

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:15.780 line:100% position:50% align:middle
But if someone were to send them
a link to this, we need to tell them,

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:20.470 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"Hey, you actually have to be logged in
before you can specifically see those

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:24.620 line:100% position:50% align:middle
hearts that you have hearted." So what
we'll do is we'll go back to our index.js,

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:30.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and we'll simply just say,
"authController.isLoggedIn".

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we first check that they're logged in,
and then we will go and get the hearts.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.010 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So go back to our Incognito window
here and refresh. Then, it just says,

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:39.875 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"Oops. You must be logged in to do that,"
and it will show us the login form.

00:03:39.875 --> 00:03:41.640 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Pretty neat. See you in the next one.

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:44.752 line:100% position:50% align:middle
