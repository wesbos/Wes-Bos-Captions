In this video, we are going to start

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.610 line:100% position:50% align:middle
learning about using our AJAX endpoint,
and we're going to start with this little

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:21.970 line:100% position:50% align:middle
search here. So if I were to search for
'coffee,' what should happen is right

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:25.440 line:100% position:50% align:middle
below, it should automatically
autocomplete a list of stores that either

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:29.670 line:100% position:50% align:middle
have 'coffee' in the name or 'coffee' in
the description. So there's a couple new

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.320 line:100% position:50% align:middle
concepts that we're going to learn about
MongoDB here other than the res.json

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.280 line:100% position:50% align:middle
in Express to actually send stuff
back as JSON rather than actually dealing

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:44.760 line:100% position:50% align:middle
with it in HTML. So first thing we need to
do is learn about this concept called

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.920 line:100% position:50% align:middle
indexes, and I think the docs do a great
job talking about what indexes are.

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:54.540 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So I'm going to read through and we'll
start a ref on it until we understand.

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:58.520 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So indexes support the efficient execution
of queries in MongoDB.

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.280 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So what does that mean? Indexes make
things fast. Without indexes,

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.040 line:100% position:50% align:middle
MongoDB must perform my collection scan,
i.e.scan over every document in the

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.880 line:100% position:50% align:middle
collection to select those documents that
match the query statement.

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.100 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So what does that mean? Let's say I have
10,000 stores, and I'm going to search for

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:18.700 line:100% position:50% align:middle
coffee. What MongoDB will do, if you don't
have an index, is it's actually going to

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.730 line:100% position:50% align:middle
just go over every single document in your
collection and say,

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:25.990 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"Do you have coffee in the title? Do you
have coffee in the title?

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:31.610 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Do you have coffee in the title?" And what
indexing does is, as a developer,

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:36.100 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you say, "Okay, I understand that we're
going to be doing a lot of queries with

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:41.660 line:100% position:50% align:middle
this field title and a lot of queries with
the field description." So we tell MongoDB

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:46.080 line:100% position:50% align:middle
ahead of time, "Hey, it would be great if
you, like, did a little bit of homework

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.330 line:100% position:50% align:middle
with these fields, if you, like, maybe
read over them really quickly so you sort

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:54.030 line:100% position:50% align:middle
of know what's in them, so that when I do
a query against you,

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.720 line:100% position:50% align:middle
like .find, then you're already going to
know what is in those and you can do a

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:04.360 line:100% position:50% align:middle
much faster, much more efficient execution
of the query." So that's really great,

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.990 line:100% position:50% align:middle
because I use mLab to do all of my
hosting, and every week, they send me an

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:15.070 line:100% position:50% align:middle
email, and they say like, "Hey, you are
performing this specific query 10,000

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:20.070 line:100% position:50% align:middle
times this week, and you're not indexing
it." Like, let's say I was searching the

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:24.330 line:100% position:50% align:middle
database for videos that match a specific
course of mine, and it was saying,

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:29.930 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"Hey, like, you're always looking up
videos that have a code called React,

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:35.370 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and you're not indexing it." So the query
is taking like 2, 3 hundred milliseconds

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.560 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to actually execute. Whereas if you told
us to index it, we could sort of, like,

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:43.890 line:100% position:50% align:middle
get the host ready. We could get stuff
ready so that when someone does query us,

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:48.002 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we can do it in a number of milliseconds
rather than 2, 300 milliseconds." So,

00:02:48.002 --> 00:02:52.120 line:100% position:50% align:middle
as a developer, if you know
that you're going to be hitting a field

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.580 line:100% position:50% align:middle
if you're going to be searching by a
field very often, it is good to index it,

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.780 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and we're going to go over an example how
to index text right now,

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:03.620 line:100% position:50% align:middle
then we're also going to over an example
how do we index our latitude and

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:11.630 line:100% position:50% align:middle
longitude. So let's go over to our
stores.js - or store.js - model,

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:15.410 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and all of your indexing will always
happen in your schema. So that's what

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:19.230 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we're going to do. We're going to go down
right below our schema here,

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:25.260 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and this is where we define our index. One
thing before we actually get into defining

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.710 line:100% position:50% align:middle
our indexes, if we go back to our MongoDB
compass here, then we go to stores,

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:33.400 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you're going to see that there is an
indexes that we can go to here.

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.060 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And by default, your ID will always be
indexed, because that's like the fastest

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.720 line:100% position:50% align:middle
way to look something up. However, if you
go to users, you'll see that we're

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:45.640 line:100% position:50% align:middle
indexing ID, that's by default, and we're
indexing email, and that's because our

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:50.800 line:100% position:50% align:middle
users, we have that plug-in, and that
plug-in has likely introduced an index

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:54.220 line:100% position:50% align:middle
for us, because that plug-in always looks
up people by their email address, as well.

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:57.810 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So those are two indexes. We're going to
learn about a couple more indexes before

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:01.930 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the end of this course. So we only have
our stores. We only have ID. But if we go

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:08.100 line:100% position:50% align:middle
here and we take our schema, and we add an
index of, and we tell it here which fields

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:13.300 line:100% position:50% align:middle
would we like it to index. So it's an
object, and we tell it. We want the name

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:18.070 line:100% position:50% align:middle
field to be indexed, because the name of
the store is important to be searched by,

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:21.520 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and we want the description of the store
to be able to search by.

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:26.820 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we take our name, and we're going to
index it as text. I'll talk about that in

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:29.430 line:100% position:50% align:middle
a second, and same with our description,
we're also going to index

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:34.920 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that as text. Another interesting thing
about indexes is you tell MongoDB what you

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:38.890 line:100% position:50% align:middle
would like it to be indexed as. In our
case, we're indexing as text, because

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:44.830 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that's going to make it possible to search
within that very efficiently and do some

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:50.040 line:100% position:50% align:middle
stuff like case sensitivity and whatnot.
So we have our index for name and

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:56.140 line:100% position:50% align:middle
description. And if you go back to your
MongoDB compass and click on refresh or

00:04:56.140 --> 00:05:00.550 line:100% position:50% align:middle
apply, I think apply will do it, and you
go to indexes, you should

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:04.270 line:100% position:50% align:middle
now see you have name_text,
description_text

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:08.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So this is what's called
the compound index, where it has two

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:14.630 line:100% position:50% align:middle
fields being indexed as one, and the type
of it is text. And it tells us the size,

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:19.490 line:100% position:50% align:middle
because it does take a little bit of space
up in your database or on your hard drive,

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:23.090 line:100% position:50% align:middle
because it does need to save some metadata
about it, and that will tell us that it's

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:28.750 line:100% position:50% align:middle
a compound index. If it doesn't show up, I
have had to quit this application and

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:33.500 line:100% position:50% align:middle
start it again to make it show up. So
don't worry too much if it doesn't show up

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:38.140 line:100% position:50% align:middle
immediately. It will be working in just a
second. And, again, if you have a larger

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:41.870 line:100% position:50% align:middle
database, sometimes it will take a little
bit of time to actually index the entire

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:46.650 line:100% position:50% align:middle
database as well. In our case, we just
have a dozen or so stores.

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:52.610 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So now that we have that indexed as text,
it's going to allow us to search via both

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:57.550 line:100% position:50% align:middle
of these fields in one shot. So let's go
and create our new route,

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:02.210 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and this is going to be our API endpoint.
So let's go into index.js,

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:08.630 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and go all the way to the bottom here, and
then make a new section for dealing with

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:13.500 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the APIs. These are where our API
endpoints are going to be, so say

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:19.720 line:100% position:50% align:middle
router.get, and I like to prefix my
endpoints with /API/search. Some people

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:23.520 line:100% position:50% align:middle
also like to version their APIs so you
have, like, version 1, and that's really

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:27.550 line:100% position:50% align:middle
nice, because if you do make changes
to your API and people are relying on it,

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:30.790 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you can just make a version 2 of that.
Well, that one will stick around. But, in

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:37.060 line:100% position:50% align:middle
our case, I'm just going to keep it
simple. We have /API/search. And when that

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:41.960 line:100% position:50% align:middle
runs, we are going to catch errors and
going to make a new method on our store

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:50.430 line:100% position:50% align:middle
controller called 'search stores.' Okay.
Then we will go to our store controller

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:55.965 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and make that search stores method
for the bottom here. Let's say

00:06:55.965 --> 00:06:59.545 line:100% position:50% align:middle
exports.searchstores is equal to

00:06:59.545 --> 00:07:07.780 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and a sync request a response. And
from that, let's just say response.json.

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:14.410 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We'll give a 'It worked.' Now, there we
go. Nice little object that we're sending

00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:21.210 line:100% position:50% align:middle
back, a sync.. Here we go. So
/API/search. Hit enter. There we go. It

00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:24.410 line:100% position:50% align:middle
worked. By the way, if you're wondering
why mine looks like this, I'm using a

00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:33.610 line:100% position:50% align:middle
plug-in called JSON viewer, and that will
do is it will give you some nice-looking

00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:37.389 line:100% position:50% align:middle
layout if you ever hit a JSON file.
Otherwise, the RAW will just look like

00:07:37.389 --> 00:07:41.190 line:100% position:50% align:middle
this for you. But you probably figured
that out by now. So now, via this,

00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:43.163 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we're going to take in a parameter

00:07:43.163 --> 00:07:47.380 line:100% position:50% align:middle
called a query or Q. So we will
go on the end of this,

00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:54.260 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and we'll say Q equals beer. And what this
will do is we will take all of the query

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:58.050 line:100% position:50% align:middle
parameters, in our case, just one called
Q, and we're going to pass it along where

00:07:58.050 --> 00:08:02.390 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it will take that beer and then search our
database for anything that includes the

00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:05.600 line:100% position:50% align:middle
word "beer." But for now, let's just
double check that we actually are getting

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:09.780 line:100% position:50% align:middle
our data. And the way that you can access
these parameters right here,

00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:15.930 line:100% position:50% align:middle
these aren't really params. They are
queries. So we go to the request,

00:08:15.930 --> 00:08:22.370 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and we just send the query back, and when
you refresh, [inaudible] request.

00:08:22.370 --> 00:08:26.257 line:100% position:50% align:middle
There we go. You see Q is equal to beer,
but if I were to add multiple query params

00:08:26.257 --> 00:08:30.832 line:100% position:50% align:middle
onto the URL, Name equals Wes
and Cool equals true,

00:08:30.832 --> 00:08:32.996 line:100% position:50% align:middle
hit enter. You see that all of these

00:08:32.996 --> 00:08:37.980 line:100% position:50% align:middle
queries are being passed along via the
URL. So request.query dot whatever it is

00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:42.730 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that you're expecting. In our case, we're
looking for Q. So let's go ahead and find

00:08:42.730 --> 00:08:48.760 line:100% position:50% align:middle
our stores. So we'll say cont stores
equals store.find, and let's just leave it

00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:52.550 line:100% position:50% align:middle
at that right now, and we'll take our
stores while we have to await them,

00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:57.340 line:100% position:50% align:middle
because it's asynchronous, and we'll just
say res.jsonstores. Then when I refresh

00:08:57.340 --> 00:08:59.760 line:100% position:50% align:middle
here, I should just get a list of all of
my stores being sent along.

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:03.280 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Good So that's every single store. We
don't necessarily need that just yet,

00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:07.760 line:100% position:50% align:middle
but we can see that our actual API
endpoint is working just fine.

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:13.410 line:100% position:50% align:middle
But what we really want to work on here is
that this find needs to take an argument

00:09:13.410 --> 00:09:18.740 line:100% position:50% align:middle
which will tell us the search for the name
property, right here,

00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:24.060 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and the description property or whatever
the person passed along with Q.

00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:29.540 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Okay. So we open up a object here. We put
it on its own line. Normally,

00:09:29.540 --> 00:09:34.850 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it'd say something like the name includes
the query but then also or the description

00:09:34.850 --> 00:09:38.030 line:100% position:50% align:middle
includes the query. And what happens when
you get into, like, really complex

00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:43.481 line:100% position:50% align:middle
queries? Do you have to take them out?
No, because what we did here is

00:09:43.481 --> 00:09:45.839 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we have indexed those two fields

00:09:45.839 --> 00:09:50.310 line:100% position:50% align:middle
into what's called a compound
index, and we've indexed them as text.

00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:56.330 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So what we can do is we can use a MongoDB
text operator, which will perform a text

00:09:56.330 --> 00:10:04.180 line:100% position:50% align:middle
search on any fields that are indexed with
a text index. So what we did by indexing

00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:08.990 line:100% position:50% align:middle
them as text is we essentially said,
"These fields are indexed as text,

00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:14.480 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and we can perform a search on anything
that is text." So we'll go back here,

00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:19.710 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and we'll say the dollar text - that's the
operator - and we're going to open that

00:10:19.710 --> 00:10:24.040 line:100% position:50% align:middle
up, and there's a couple options, and the
first obvious one we need is this search.

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:28.810 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We want that to be the request.query.q,
and there's a couple other

00:10:28.810 --> 00:10:33.180 line:100% position:50% align:middle
operators that we have here with our
.text. So we can say language,

00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:35.740 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and this will determine what
language it is. Case sensitive.

00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:40.500 line:100% position:50% align:middle
By default, it's case insensitive, meaning
that if you have capital B beer or lower

00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:49.450 line:100% position:50% align:middle
case b beer, it will do both of them, and
then diet tread, diarrhea,

00:10:49.450 --> 00:10:53.310 line:100% position:50% align:middle
diaractic sensitive. Whatever that word
is, I had to Google it,

00:10:53.310 --> 00:10:59.100 line:100% position:50% align:middle
but what it means is that if you have like
an e accent aigu in one of your

00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:04.140 line:100% position:50% align:middle
words, then it will just treat it as a
regular e. So somebody is searching for

00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:10.390 line:100% position:50% align:middle
resume, and you search for resume, then it
will ignore the accents and have

00:11:10.390 --> 00:11:13.780 line:100% position:50% align:middle
everything on that letter. So we don't
need to pass any of these case sensitive

00:11:13.780 --> 00:11:18.160 line:100% position:50% align:middle
or diaractic sensitive as they are on by
default. And I can't think of a whole lot

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:22.150 line:100% position:50% align:middle
of situations where you would want to turn
them off. So we have that search coming

00:11:22.150 --> 00:11:26.260 line:100% position:50% align:middle
in so far. Give that a save. Now if we go
back here and refresh this URL here,

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:32.570 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you'll see that we only now get one, two,
three things back, because I searched for

00:11:32.570 --> 00:11:39.510 line:100% position:50% align:middle
beer. If I search for bread, we get
nothing, because there's no stores with

00:11:39.510 --> 00:11:45.780 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that in there. Let's take a look at some
of our other stores... sour. Let's try

00:11:45.780 --> 00:11:48.725 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that. One store, because one store has
sour. What about coffee?

00:11:48.725 --> 00:11:52.300 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now, the one thing that's wrong
with this search for coffee

00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:54.896 line:100% position:50% align:middle
is that it doesn't put them
in any specific order.

00:11:54.896 --> 00:11:58.980 line:100% position:50% align:middle
It actually just brings them back in the
order in which they were added to the

00:11:58.980 --> 00:12:06.500 line:100% position:50% align:middle
database and the date created. So what we
need to do is now sort these based on some

00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:12.580 line:100% position:50% align:middle
sort of score or invisible field that will
allow us to see like if this one says

00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:16.380 line:100% position:50% align:middle
coffee a couple times, and the other one
at the bottom only says coffee once,

00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:19.860 line:100% position:50% align:middle
then you want to score the one with the
highest score first, and obviously the one

00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:24.380 line:100% position:50% align:middle
with the lowest score last. That's where
we get, start getting into what's called

00:12:24.380 --> 00:12:29.670 line:100% position:50% align:middle
metadata in MongoDB. And if we look at
this metaoperator in MongoDB,

00:12:29.670 --> 00:12:36.150 line:100% position:50% align:middle
what this does is will allow us to project
in, and MongoDB's a fancy word for add

00:12:36.150 --> 00:12:41.220 line:100% position:50% align:middle
a field. It will allow us to add a
field using some of this hidden data

00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:47.720 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that MongoDB has about our search results,
and we can add that to the actual end

00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:51.760 line:100% position:50% align:middle
result. So we take our find here. Our find
has one argument which is a query.

00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:56.970 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Good. Now we can have a second argument
here, which is can also be an object,

00:12:56.970 --> 00:13:01.840 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and we are going to tell it to project.
Again, project means add a field.

00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:07.260 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We're going to tell it to project a score
field, and the score is going to be made

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:12.920 line:100% position:50% align:middle
up of the metadata, which is something
called a text score. And the text score is

00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:18.290 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the only metadata that is currently in
MongoDB. I'm not sure if they have plans

00:13:18.290 --> 00:13:21.890 line:100% position:50% align:middle
for adding more, but in this case, when we
search for beer, it's going to give it a

00:13:21.890 --> 00:13:26.730 line:100% position:50% align:middle
score of how close to that did we actually
get. So we just projected a score on

00:13:26.730 --> 00:13:32.590 line:100% position:50% align:middle
there. Give it a save, and refresh this.
Now you will see, let's take a look,

00:13:32.590 --> 00:13:34.690 line:100% position:50% align:middle
score. There it goes, 0.5454444. This one,
0.8. This one, 1.2. You can see that it's

00:13:34.690 --> 00:13:39.180 line:100% position:50% align:middle
actually climbing, and we want the other
way around, Mulberry Coffee.

00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:42.540 line:100% position:50% align:middle
It's in the name. It's in the description.
So how do we then order that in the

00:13:42.540 --> 00:13:54.400 line:100% position:50% align:middle
opposite order? Well, we can take this
semicolon off, chain on a .sort,

00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:59.290 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and we want to sort it based on our new
metaproperty, which is score,

00:13:59.290 --> 00:14:04.460 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and the value of that is going to be meta
and text score once more.

00:14:04.460 --> 00:14:09.140 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And that should take our meta value, which
is score, and sort it by that actual

00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:14.430 line:100% position:50% align:middle
value. We refresh this now, and you see
that our top-scoring one,

00:14:14.430 --> 00:14:19.320 line:100% position:50% align:middle
1.29 is at the top, and the lowest scoring
one, 0.54 is at the very bottom.

00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:22.950 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So if this looks a little bit weird to
you, it's because there's a lot of nested

00:14:22.950 --> 00:14:28.380 line:100% position:50% align:middle
objects in here. What I do like to do
sometimes is to find on one line,

00:14:28.380 --> 00:14:33.220 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and then a sort on the next. You can write
little comments. First find stores that

00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:39.060 line:100% position:50% align:middle
match, then sort them. And then finally we
also want to only return five, because if

00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:45.720 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we had 10,000, we only want to hit the top
5. So we can limit to only 5 results.

00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:50.790 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Let's say .limit5. You see how you can
like sort of chain, find,

00:14:50.790 --> 00:14:56.620 line:100% position:50% align:middle
sort, and limit all along in one query?
Very nice that way. So that's the first

00:14:56.620 --> 00:15:00.500 line:100% position:50% align:middle
half of actually creating our API. On the
next video, what we're going to do is

00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:05.170 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we're going to go on our frontend and use
that to actually pull it in when somebody

00:15:05.170 --> 00:15:12.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
searches in that search bar.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
