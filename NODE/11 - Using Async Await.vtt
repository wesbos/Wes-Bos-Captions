00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:13.629 line:100% position:50% align:middle
In order to start working with the
database, we first need

00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:16.619 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to import Mongoose. Again, Mongoose
is our package that we use

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.550 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to interface with our MongoDB database.
So we say "const Mongoose equals

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:27.733 line:100% position:50% align:middle
require Mongoose." Then we also need
reference to our store .js schema,

00:00:27.733 --> 00:00:31.817 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and rather than importing this schema
directly from the file because we've

00:00:31.817 --> 00:00:36.708 line:100% position:50% align:middle
already imported it once in our
start.js file, remember in our require

00:00:36.708 --> 00:00:41.419 line:100% position:50% align:middle
model store, we can simply reference it
off the Mongoose variable here

00:00:41.419 --> 00:00:45.150 line:100% position:50% align:middle
because Mongoose uses a concept
called a singleton, which allows us

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:48.975 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to only import our models once
and then reference them anywhere

00:00:48.975 --> 00:00:58.460 line:100% position:50% align:middle
in our application. So const Store equals
mongoose.model Store, and that comes

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:02.720 line:100% position:50% align:middle
from...where did that Store come from?
Well, at the bottom of our model, where we

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:08.344 line:100% position:50% align:middle
create the model here, we are setting it
to be store, and here we are getting it

00:01:08.344 --> 00:01:11.063 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and putting it back into this
variable here. Good.

00:01:11.063 --> 00:01:14.988 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now let's go into our create store,
and let's talk about how to actually

00:01:14.988 --> 00:01:21.858 line:100% position:50% align:middle
create a store with MongoDB. So the way,
that you do it is you say const store

00:01:21.858 --> 00:01:28.908 line:100% position:50% align:middle
equals new Store, and then you pass it
in object full of a name, a description,

00:01:28.908 --> 00:01:32.707 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and the tags. So the way that we can do
that is already in request.body,

00:01:32.707 --> 00:01:36.745 line:100% position:50% align:middle
so we can just pass that directly
from the body into our store.

00:01:36.745 --> 00:01:40.881 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now you may be saying like, "Well, what
happens if somebody posts some other

00:01:40.881 --> 00:01:45.158 line:100% position:50% align:middle
data that we don't necessarily want?
Is that going to be a bit of an issue?"

00:01:45.158 --> 00:01:50.301 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Well, no, it's not an issue because if you
open up your store.js, we are using

00:01:50.301 --> 00:01:55.839 line:100% position:50% align:middle
what's called a strict schema by default,
and it will only pick up the actual fields

00:01:55.839 --> 00:01:59.682 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that we have set out in this schema.
Anything else will get thrown away.

00:01:59.682 --> 00:02:04.430 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we have our store. Now, in order
to save this to the database,

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:08.100 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we just created the store here, and we
could go ahead and add new stuff to the

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:13.545 line:100% position:50% align:middle
stuff, so store.age equals 10, store.cool
equals true. You can keep adding fields

00:02:13.545 --> 00:02:18.460 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to your store, but none of that will be
reflected in the database until you call

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:23.161 line:100% position:50% align:middle
store.save. And what that will do is once
you call store.save, it's going to fire

00:02:23.161 --> 00:02:28.145 line:100% position:50% align:middle
off a connection to your MongoDB database,
save that data, and then come back to us

00:02:28.145 --> 00:02:34.390 line:100% position:50% align:middle
with either the store itself or an error
saying what happened. Maybe there was a

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.442 line:100% position:50% align:middle
validation error. Maybe there was some
missing data, incorrect data.

00:02:38.442 --> 00:02:39.078 line:100% position:50% align:middle
You don't know.

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:43.940 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So at this point what you need to take
sort of a look at the history of Mongoose

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:49.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and how it's been working. So in the olden
days, what we would do is we would have a

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.047 line:100% position:50% align:middle
callback function because JavaScript is a
synchronous...meaning that if I were

00:02:54.047 --> 00:02:58.721 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to call a bunch of code right here
and maybe console log, it worked,

00:02:58.721 --> 00:03:03.405 line:100% position:50% align:middle
or in our case, we're going to redirect
them to maybe like the home page,

00:03:03.405 --> 00:03:08.384 line:100% position:50% align:middle
what that's going to do is it's going
to fire off the save, and then redirect

00:03:08.384 --> 00:03:13.336 line:100% position:50% align:middle
them to the home page, but the
save will not happen immediately.

00:03:13.336 --> 00:03:16.860 line:100% position:50% align:middle
The save will take some time because this
sort of stuff where you...if you ever do

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:21.350 line:100% position:50% align:middle
an ajax request, you know that it takes
time, or if you ever save some data to a

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:25.647 line:100% position:50% align:middle
database, it will take a little bit
of time, but JavaScript will not wait

00:03:25.647 --> 00:03:30.903 line:100% position:50% align:middle
for anybody because it's a synchronous
by default, and what that means is that it

00:03:30.903 --> 00:03:34.760 line:100% position:50% align:middle
would simply just fire it off and then
redirect you, regardless of if that

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:39.120 line:100% position:50% align:middle
actually worked or not. And that's a bit
of a problem for us because before we

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:44.591 line:100% position:50% align:middle
redirect them, we need to know, was there
an error? And if so, we need to display

00:03:44.591 --> 00:03:47.860 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it to the user and tell them,
"Hey, this actually didn't work."

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:52.052 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So the way that we initially did it is we
would have a callback function here,

00:03:52.052 --> 00:03:56.186 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and that would pass us the error if there
was an error, and then it would pass us

00:03:56.186 --> 00:04:00.520 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the actual store, or the document, as it's
called in MongoDB. You can call that

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:06.616 line:100% position:50% align:middle
whatever you want. And then, in here you
say, if there is no error, then you can

00:04:06.616 --> 00:04:13.378 line:100% position:50% align:middle
take your redirect, and take your
console log, it worked, and put it

00:04:13.378 --> 00:04:18.096 line:100% position:50% align:middle
up inside of here. Now, whew!
That's a lot of code just for a simple

00:04:18.096 --> 00:04:21.212 line:100% position:50% align:middle
saving of a store. What happens
if you need to first query

00:04:21.212 --> 00:04:25.246 line:100% position:50% align:middle
three or four stores, then loop
over the data, then save two of those

00:04:25.246 --> 00:04:29.350 line:100% position:50% align:middle
actual stores? You can see how
this code would get really

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:35.840 line:100% position:50% align:middle
complicated if you need to have any sort
of order of operation inside of your

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:40.920 line:100% position:50% align:middle
actual code because in here, then once it
worked, maybe you would take another one

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:45.973 line:100% position:50% align:middle
like reviews. and like you would find all
of the reviews, and then when that

00:04:45.973 --> 00:04:50.442 line:100% position:50% align:middle
is done, you have the error and the
reviews, and then when that is done,

00:04:50.442 --> 00:04:53.847 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and you want to redirect them. You could
see how things just start getting nested

00:04:53.847 --> 00:04:59.945 line:100% position:50% align:middle
deeper and deeper and deeper if you just
want to do what? One, two, three,

00:04:59.945 --> 00:05:04.224 line:100% position:50% align:middle
four, five. If you want to do six things
before you actually send some data

00:05:04.224 --> 00:05:09.428 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to the actual user, your code gets
to be looking like what's called a

00:05:09.428 --> 00:05:12.643 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Christmas tree code, or this is referred
to as callback hell, where you have

00:05:12.643 --> 00:05:17.752 line:100% position:50% align:middle
nested data over and over and over again.
So that's not a great way to code

00:05:17.752 --> 00:05:20.947 line:100% position:50% align:middle
your app. You will see a lot of example
code online like that because that's

00:05:20.947 --> 00:05:25.965 line:100% position:50% align:middle
how it was for many, many years.
But let's bring it back, bring it back,

00:05:25.965 --> 00:05:29.423 line:100% position:50% align:middle
bring it back. Let's bring it back just
to this right here store.save.

00:05:29.423 --> 00:05:34.754 line:100% position:50% align:middle
What we have now transitioned
over to is using Mongoose with what's

00:05:34.754 --> 00:05:38.900 line:100% position:50% align:middle
called promises, and promises
will immediately return to you,

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:42.040 line:100% position:50% align:middle
not the data, whether it worked or not
because that's impossible.

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:45.855 line:100% position:50% align:middle
What it will return to us is a promise
which is sort of like an IOU note

00:05:45.855 --> 00:05:50.997 line:100% position:50% align:middle
for, "I will eventually come back to you
with either the data, which the store

00:05:50.997 --> 00:05:55.281 line:100% position:50% align:middle
saved, or the data that you queried, or
an error saying something had happened."

00:05:55.281 --> 00:06:00.164 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we had changed our...we take that
save out, put it on it's own line, take

00:06:00.164 --> 00:06:05.184 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the semicolon off, and then we would
chain.then, which is what you use

00:06:05.184 --> 00:06:09.314 line:100% position:50% align:middle
in a promise. And the reason why we can
use a promise is because if you look

00:06:09.314 --> 00:06:13.910 line:100% position:50% align:middle
back at our start.js, remember they did
this mongoose.promise equals

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:17.702 line:100% position:50% align:middle
global.promise. What this does is at first
tells Mongoose that we are using

00:06:17.702 --> 00:06:21.929 line:100% position:50% align:middle
promises, and second, it tells us that
we're using built-in ES6 promises

00:06:21.929 --> 00:06:25.886 line:100% position:50% align:middle
because there are additional promise
libraries like Bluebird and whatnot,

00:06:25.886 --> 00:06:30.350 line:100% position:50% align:middle
but now that ES6 promises are out, we
can just use them.

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:34.370 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we have then, we have a store that
comes back, and then you could say

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:39.667 line:100% position:50% align:middle
like res.json, the actual store data,
and if there's an error, you catch the

00:06:39.667 --> 00:06:45.785 line:100% position:50% align:middle
error, and then you do something, throw
error with the actual error in there.

00:06:45.825 --> 00:06:51.190 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So that's good, and the beauty of that is
you can chain store, so maybe you want it

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:58.740 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to save the store, but then you want it
to return store.find all of the stores

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:02.200 line:100% position:50% align:middle
because you want it to immediately display
a list of all of the stores like the

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:06.216 line:100% position:50% align:middle
latest ten. And then what that will allow
you to do is you can chain stores,

00:07:06.216 --> 00:07:11.840 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and that will allow us to do
like res.render store list,

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:15.460 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and you want to pass it a list of the
stores which is just stores.

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:19.729 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So that's great because you can chain
these things on and on and on as long

00:07:19.729 --> 00:07:25.830 line:100% position:50% align:middle
as you possibly want, as long as each one
of these is returning some sort of promise

00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:30.020 line:100% position:50% align:middle
from each of the thens. So that made
things a little bit easier because we're

00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:35.160 line:100% position:50% align:middle
not in callback hell anymore. We're just
in sort of chaining promise land.

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:43.986 line:100% position:50% align:middle
The promise land is chained, but we can do
even better. In ES8, we have something

00:07:43.986 --> 00:07:49.327 line:100% position:50% align:middle
called async await, which also does
away with all of this then, then,

00:07:49.327 --> 00:07:53.736 line:100% position:50% align:middle
thening catch. So let's go back to here.
Let's bring the save back onto its

00:07:53.736 --> 00:07:54.318 line:100% position:50% align:middle
own line.

00:07:55.906 --> 00:08:01.920 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now, let's say I wanted a console log. It
worked only once the save has finished.

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:06.370 line:100% position:50% align:middle
The way that we can do that is we can tell
JavaScript, "Hey, hold on a second.

00:08:06.370 --> 00:08:11.683 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Just like cool your jets, and wait
until I've done this save, and then

00:08:11.683 --> 00:08:15.933 line:100% position:50% align:middle
continue on," and that's with something
called async await, and the way that that

00:08:15.933 --> 00:08:21.298 line:100% position:50% align:middle
works is you go to your function, and you
mark this function as async, and that

00:08:21.298 --> 00:08:26.884 line:100% position:50% align:middle
will tell the browser or node.js that,
"Hey, this function that I'm using is

00:08:26.884 --> 00:08:31.430 line:100% position:50% align:middle
going to have some awaits inside of it or
possibly have some awaits inside of it,"

00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:36.453 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and then we can go in front of the thing
that returns a promise and simply await

00:08:36.453 --> 00:08:41.826 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it because store.save will return to us
a promise, and we then can await it,

00:08:41.826 --> 00:08:46.637 line:100% position:50% align:middle
meaning that we will not move
on to line 16 until the save has

00:08:47.323 --> 00:08:49.004 line:100% position:50% align:middle
successfully happened.

00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:52.820 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Good. So don't worry too too much if this
doesn't make a whole lot of sense.

00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:55.223 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We're going to be doing it quite a bit,
especially if you're brand new

00:08:55.223 --> 00:09:00.730 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to promises, it can be a little bit of a
woe, but we'll get it as we go along.

00:09:00.730 --> 00:09:04.593 line:100% position:50% align:middle
One more thing that we need to know
about async await is that there's no...

00:09:04.593 --> 00:09:11.847 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you noticed that before we had a callback
that passed an error, or we had a .catch

00:09:11.847 --> 00:09:16.340 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that gave us the error. In order to catch
an error with async await,

00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:22.756 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you generally have to wrap your entire
code in a try. You try all this stuff,

00:09:22.930 --> 00:09:27.280 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and then you have this fallback catch.
We'll give you the error, and then if that

00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:30.861 line:100% position:50% align:middle
happens, you need to do something
with your actual error in here. Maybe you

00:09:30.861 --> 00:09:35.630 line:100% position:50% align:middle
console log it or send the user
to a 404 page or whatnot.

00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:40.891 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I'm not a huge fan of that because the
whole try catch thing, the whole beauty

00:09:40.891 --> 00:09:44.280 line:100% position:50% align:middle
of async await is that you don't have
to have all of this nested code,

00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:48.460 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and if you have to wrap your code in this
ugly try catch, it's a bit of a bummer.

00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:54.570 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So, two solutions, just don't write code
that has bugs, which is what I do.

00:09:54.570 --> 00:10:00.075 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I'm joking. You can't ever do that because
if there is an error, your node.js process

00:10:00.075 --> 00:10:03.720 line:100% position:50% align:middle
will quit on you, and that's not good
to happen.

00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:06.560 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So you always have to handle your errors
even if you think you're amazing

00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:07.980 line:100% position:50% align:middle
at programming and you never write errors.

00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:14.360 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So how are we going to handle that? Well,
one cool way is that we can use something

00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:20.040 line:100% position:50% align:middle
called composition, which is you can take
this create store and wrap it in another

00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:26.590 line:100% position:50% align:middle
function that will catch any errors. So we
create a higher function that wraps create

00:10:26.590 --> 00:10:32.590 line:100% position:50% align:middle
store, and if any of this code in here was
to throw an error, if anything weird was

00:10:32.590 --> 00:10:38.400 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to happen inside of here, we will have a
function that wraps it that will handle

00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:41.610 line:100% position:50% align:middle
all of our error handling,
which is really, really nice.

00:10:41.610 --> 00:10:47.463 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So I've already coded this function
for you. Let's open up error handlers.js,

00:10:47.463 --> 00:10:54.675 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and you see this catch errors here. What
this will do, and this is essentially

00:10:54.675 --> 00:11:00.310 line:100% position:50% align:middle
just a middleware that we can use here,
is it will take in the function,

00:11:00.310 --> 00:11:06.940 line:100% position:50% align:middle
which in our case is the create store
function, and it will return a function

00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:11.815 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that calls it...this is a function that
calls a function, and if there is

00:11:11.815 --> 00:11:19.892 line:100% position:50% align:middle
an error, it will catch it and call
.next. Okay, follow with me. And what

00:11:19.892 --> 00:11:30.220 line:100% position:50% align:middle
.next will do is if we look at our app.js,
remember we have all of our routes.

00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:36.418 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Where are they? Here we go, app.use
routes, and all of our routes are going

00:11:36.418 --> 00:11:39.330 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to be wrapped in this error handler here.

00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:45.718 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So if any of our routes hit an error, this
error handler is going to kick in,

00:11:45.718 --> 00:11:50.230 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and it's going to catch the error because
we don't want to have to do it.

00:11:50.230 --> 00:11:54.155 line:100% position:50% align:middle
It's going to catch it for us, and it's
going to immediately call next,

00:11:54.155 --> 00:11:59.115 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and what next will do is it's just going
to say, "Okay, well something

00:11:59.115 --> 00:12:01.487 line:100% position:50% align:middle
just happened. We're not going to use
any of these routes here.

00:12:01.487 --> 00:12:06.573 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We're just going to pass it along the
chain of middleware, which is either

00:12:06.573 --> 00:12:10.808 line:100% position:50% align:middle
going to be a not found or a validation
flash error, which we're going to talk

00:12:10.808 --> 00:12:14.912 line:100% position:50% align:middle
about, or it's going to most likely,
it's going to be this one, which is going

00:12:14.912 --> 00:12:18.057 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to either show us our development errors
or our production errors.

00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:22.040 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So I know that's a little bit confusing
because there's a whole lot of steps that

00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:27.293 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that has to filter through, but we will
keep coming back to how this works,

00:12:27.293 --> 00:12:31.888 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and as we go along, but the main thing
that we need to learn about here is that

00:12:31.888 --> 00:12:38.925 line:100% position:50% align:middle
if you do not wrap your async await
functions in a try catch, you need to wrap

00:12:38.925 --> 00:12:46.115 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it in this catch errors function right
here, so that it will handle all of the

00:12:46.115 --> 00:12:51.051 line:100% position:50% align:middle
errors for you. Let's go back to our
routes here, and we need to then

00:12:51.051 --> 00:12:54.585 line:100% position:50% align:middle
import that error handler
because this create store function,

00:12:54.585 --> 00:12:59.115 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it is async await, so it needs
to be wrapped in that catch

00:12:59.115 --> 00:13:04.180 line:100% position:50% align:middle
error function. We need to use
composition, which is wrapping a function

00:13:04.180 --> 00:13:09.987 line:100% position:50% align:middle
in a function. So we will do this. We'll
say const curly brackets catch errors

00:13:09.987 --> 00:13:15.861 line:100% position:50% align:middle
equals require, then we'll go up a level
into our handlers directory, and then

00:13:15.861 --> 00:13:20.190 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we'll grab our error handlers.js file,
don't need the .js on the end.

00:13:20.190 --> 00:13:24.370 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So, whoa, we haven't done this before.
What is this? This is just something

00:13:24.370 --> 00:13:30.230 line:100% position:50% align:middle
called object de-structuring, which will
allow us to import an entire object, which

00:13:30.230 --> 00:13:34.790 line:100% position:50% align:middle
will have an object exports.catch
error, exports.not found,

00:13:34.790 --> 00:13:37.719 line:100% position:50% align:middle
exports.flash validation.
We don't need all of these.

00:13:37.719 --> 00:13:41.929 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We just need to catch errors.
So by taking de-structuring,

00:13:41.929 --> 00:13:46.660 line:100% position:50% align:middle
if you've taken my ES6 course, you'll know
that what that will do is just creates a

00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:50.974 line:100% position:50% align:middle
variable called catch errors, and it's not
necessary to import the entire thing,

00:13:50.974 --> 00:13:56.600 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and then grab a property off of it. We can
simply just import the one method that we

00:13:56.600 --> 00:14:01.396 line:100% position:50% align:middle
need, and then we'll take this catch
errors and wrap our controller

00:14:01.396 --> 00:14:02.688 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that is async await.

00:14:02.688 --> 00:14:06.270 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So essentially, what this is going to do
is it's immediately going to run catch

00:14:06.270 --> 00:14:10.650 line:100% position:50% align:middle
errors when you boot up your application,
and catch errors is going to take that

00:14:10.650 --> 00:14:14.160 line:100% position:50% align:middle
function, wrap it in another function, a
higher order function,

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:19.300 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and then return to us that function with a
catch tacked on to the end, that will then

00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:24.372 line:100% position:50% align:middle
handle pushing up to the next value.
So, again, don't worry too too much if

00:14:24.372 --> 00:14:27.551 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that doesn't make a whole lot of sense.
It's a bit confusing, but it's a nice

00:14:27.551 --> 00:14:33.255 line:100% position:50% align:middle
clean way for us to just catch any of the
errors and push them along to some later

00:14:33.255 --> 00:14:38.647 line:100% position:50% align:middle
middleware, rather than us have to catch
the error in every single controller

00:14:38.647 --> 00:14:42.429 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that we have, and then to handle it.
In here, we don't have to handle the

00:14:42.429 --> 00:14:46.640 line:100% position:50% align:middle
errors, unless we explicitly want to do
the error handling in a special way.

00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:50.946 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We simply just let the errors happen,
let the error handler catch it for us,

00:14:50.946 --> 00:14:57.262 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and then push it along our middleware
stack, so that one of our error handlers,

00:14:57.262 --> 00:15:00.232 line:100% position:50% align:middle
not found, validation errors,
development errors,

00:15:00.232 --> 00:15:04.720 line:100% position:50% align:middle
or production errors, one of these
middlewares is going to figure out which

00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:10.380 line:100% position:50% align:middle
one should be actually displaying
it for us. So, whew! Let's go back to our

00:15:10.380 --> 00:15:14.055 line:100% position:50% align:middle
create store function. We have our async.
We are awaiting the store.save.

00:15:14.055 --> 00:15:18.320 line:100% position:50% align:middle
When the store is saved,
we are going to redirect them.

00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:25.328 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Let's just redirect them to the home page
for now, so res.redirect to forward slash.

00:15:25.328 --> 00:15:30.160 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So give it a save. Let's go back
to our add folder here.

00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:36.075 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Let's try add a store called bakery,
and the description is I love bread,

00:15:36.075 --> 00:15:40.208 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and we're going to make it vegetarian
and open late and give it a save.

00:15:40.208 --> 00:15:46.592 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Whew! Look what happened there. It saved
the data and then redirected us to the

00:15:46.592 --> 00:15:50.585 line:100% position:50% align:middle
home page. How do we know if
it worked? Well, we can open up our

00:15:50.585 --> 00:15:57.594 line:100% position:50% align:middle
MongoDB compass application here,
and we can connect back to our compass

00:15:57.594 --> 00:16:02.147 line:100% position:50% align:middle
database that we have. So either you
are on local host, or you are on your

00:16:02.147 --> 00:16:05.801 line:100% position:50% align:middle
mLab, depending on which one you have.
It should be still in your sidebar here.

00:16:05.801 --> 00:16:10.390 line:100% position:50% align:middle
If you ever forget your username
and password, again, you can just open

00:16:10.390 --> 00:16:15.423 line:100% position:50% align:middle
up that variables.env, and here you will
see your username, your password,

00:16:15.423 --> 00:16:20.770 line:100% position:50% align:middle
your host, your port, and your
database name.

00:16:20.770 --> 00:16:24.920 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So those are, if you ever forget it, it
will always be in your variables.env file.

00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:29.726 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So I'm going to connect to that, and we
find our database, and you now see if you

00:16:29.745 --> 00:16:36.670 line:100% position:50% align:middle
go to stores, whoo ooh, one! Click it
and click on documents, and you see that

00:16:36.670 --> 00:16:41.970 line:100% position:50% align:middle
there's the bakery. The slug has been
made lowercase, the name, I love bread,

00:16:41.970 --> 00:16:45.310 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and then we added a couple of tags. There
they are, open late and vegetarian.

00:16:45.310 --> 00:16:49.780 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Let's try it again. Go to add, we're going
to add fish market,

00:16:49.780 --> 00:16:55.690 line:100% position:50% align:middle
shout out to catch of the day, and let's
say licensed. You'll have a beer at our

00:16:55.690 --> 00:17:00.210 line:100% position:50% align:middle
fish market. Click on save. Good. It just
redirected us to the home page,

00:17:00.210 --> 00:17:04.680 line:100% position:50% align:middle
but if I click on refresh, aha, second one
has now been popping up.

00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:08.575 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So that's all you need in order
to save data to a database.

00:17:08.575 --> 00:17:12.180 line:100% position:50% align:middle
You first create your schema, what your
data looks like, and then in your

00:17:12.180 --> 00:17:17.055 line:100% position:50% align:middle
controller, you create a new version
from that schema, and you call it .save

00:17:17.055 --> 00:17:20.754 line:100% position:50% align:middle
on it, and because we use async await,
there's no nested callbacks. There's no

00:17:20.754 --> 00:17:25.747 line:100% position:50% align:middle
promise chaining.then. It's simply just
wait for it to save, then do some data.
