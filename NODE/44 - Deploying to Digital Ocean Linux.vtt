In this video, we're going to be setting
up DigitalOcean. DigitalOcean is sort of a

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:21.670 line:100% position:50% align:middle
server provider, and they're pretty sweet
because, A, they're fairly cheap and,

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:25.290 line:100% position:50% align:middle
B, they actually give you access to the
raw server if you want to get in there and

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:29.310 line:100% position:50% align:middle
make some changes, and have full control
over your entire environment.

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.730 line:100% position:50% align:middle
The last two are sort of just services.
While they can do absolutely everything

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:36.660 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that we need, it can be a little bit
limiting if you just want to get in there

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.820 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and see what's on your hard drive and what
not. So we have the ability to create our

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.910 line:100% position:50% align:middle
own Linux server. But before we even do
that, I want to just figure out how are we

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:50.260 line:100% position:50% align:middle
going to get the files on the server once
we've created it? There are all kinds of

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:54.310 line:100% position:50% align:middle
different ways that you can get your files
on a server. You can use something called

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:59.740 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"rsync", which would sync them all up. You
can SSH into your box and move those over

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:04.300 line:100% position:50% align:middle
with something called "STP". You can use
an FTP client that supports SFTP,

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:08.860 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and you just log in with that, and drag
and drop your files. There's all kinds of

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.030 line:100% position:50% align:middle
different ways, and what we're going to be
doing is using a Git repo that we can then

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.250 line:100% position:50% align:middle
push to GitHub, and then go on to our
server and pull that down from GitHub.

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.960 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we're going to go to GitHub here, and
we're going to create a new repo,

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:26.390 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and we're going to call this
"testing-deploy-node", and then "Testing

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:32.520 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Deploy". Let's try that. Create the repo.
What we want to do is we already have an

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:38.360 line:100% position:50% align:middle
existing repo, so we just need these two
lines right here. There we go,

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.030 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and we're just pushing up all of our data.
Again, this is going to take a little bit,

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.600 line:100% position:50% align:middle
because we do have quite a few images in
our actual repo. As you get more and more

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.510 line:100% position:50% align:middle
images, it might make sense to start
looking at, rather than storing your

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:53.290 line:100% position:50% align:middle
images right in your Uploads folder, but
storing them on something like Amazon S3,

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:58.240 line:100% position:50% align:middle
where your files are stored on a separate
CDN. There we go. I've got everything

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.410 line:100% position:50% align:middle
uploaded here, and I give it a refresh.
You should see that your entire

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:05.890 line:100% position:50% align:middle
application, except your variables.env are
up and running. Good.

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:08.990 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now, we go back to DigitalOcean and you're
logged into your dashboard.

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:11.860 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Create an account if you haven't. Then,
you should see a button that says,

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:17.250 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"Create a New Droplet". What we want to do
is go over to our one-click apps here,

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.480 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and we want to select the highest version
of Node that they currently offer.

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.870 line:100% position:50% align:middle
It looks like it's 6.10.2. That's not
nearly as close as what we need.

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.850 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We need at least 7.6. But it's going to
get us there, and we'll hop on the server

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:34.950 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and upgrade it ourselves. So click on
that. We do need at least one gig of RAM

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:40.380 line:100% position:50% align:middle
in order to do our npm install. I have
found that if you choose a $5 one,

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:44.960 line:100% position:50% align:middle
when you do npm install, the npm install
will fail. The reason is because there's

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:52.190 line:100% position:50% align:middle
just not enough memory for it to download
all those files. Although that's said,

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:56.330 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the $5 server is good enough for our
application. It's just the npm install

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:00.420 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that it fails on. So if you do want to
save yourself $5 a month,

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:05.400 line:100% position:50% align:middle
do a quick search for "how to add swap
memory." Now, this is Ubuntu 12,

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.250 line:100% position:50% align:middle
but I followed these on my own server,
because I didn't feel like paying an extra

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:13.050 line:100% position:50% align:middle
$5 a month for npm install. What this will
do is it will install something called

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:18.360 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"swap memory," which you can use the file
system as sort of temporary memory,

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:22.950 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and then that way the npm install will
work. If you don't know what I'm talking

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:28.070 line:100% position:50% align:middle
about, then let's just go with the $10 a
month one. You could even do the $10,

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:32.490 line:100% position:50% align:middle
do our install, and then size down to $5 a
month, if you're really worried about it.

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:36.500 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Then, you pick your location, where you
want to go. I'm going to go with the

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:41.760 line:100% position:50% align:middle
default New York 2, and then SSH keys. If
you don't know what an SSH key is,

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.180 line:100% position:50% align:middle
essentially, what it is, it's like a
little fingerprint on your computer so

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:48.800 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that when you try to log into a server,
you don't need to provide the username and

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:53.220 line:100% position:50% align:middle
password. You simply just log into it and
the SSH key is proof enough that you're

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:58.740 line:100% position:50% align:middle
actually coming from an authorized
machine. I'm not going to show an SSH key,

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:02.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
just so that if you're not familiar with
them, you can keep going and only use the

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.960 line:100% position:50% align:middle
password. But ideally, what you would do
is you would create an SSH key and log in

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:10.090 line:100% position:50% align:middle
without any sort of password. Finally, you
create a host name.

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:14.490 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We'll call this "node-deploy1", or
whatever it is you'd like to call it,

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:20.010 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and click on Create. Now, while you wait
for this to go ahead and create itself,

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:24.090 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we can hop over to our email and grab the
password that it's going to send you.

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:27.410 line:100% position:50% align:middle
It's a one-time password that we need to
get into our box. Now,

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:31.470 line:100% position:50% align:middle
after about a minute or so, you're going
to see that your server is ready to go and

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:36.830 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it will give you an IP address. What comes
in your email if you didn't use an SSH key

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:39.990 line:100% position:50% align:middle
is you'll see the name of the Droplet, the
IP address, your username,

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:44.260 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and then this one-time use password. So
what we need to do now is to actually get

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:49.840 line:100% position:50% align:middle
into our box. When I mean "box", I mean
get into our server. We do that via

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:53.200 line:100% position:50% align:middle
something called "SSH". So open up your
terminal. If you're on Windows,

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:56.560 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you need to download a program called
"PuTTY", and that will allow you to do SSH

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:00.160 line:100% position:50% align:middle
on Windows. Or if you're really into it,
there's a new thing on Windows called

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:04.790 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"Windows Subsystem Linux", which will
allow you to use SSH on Windows no

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:08.160 line:100% position:50% align:middle
problem, if you'd like to look into that.
Otherwise, just download PuTTY.

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:11.310 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So here we go. We're going to do SSH, and
then you say "root",

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:15.410 line:100% position:50% align:middle
because that's your username, you can
create more later, "@", and then you grab

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:19.280 line:100% position:50% align:middle
IP address. That's sort of like the domain
name for your server.

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:22.390 line:100% position:50% align:middle
It's going to ask if you want to have a
fingerprint. Yes, you do.

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:26.320 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Then, it's asking you for your password if
you have a password.

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:30.830 line:100% position:50% align:middle
If you don't, then you will already be
logged in, because you used an SSH key.

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:33.240 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So I'm going to paste it in there. It's
not going to show us anything.

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:37.470 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Hit Enter, and then it's immediately going
to ask you to set a new password.

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:43.530 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So paste your current password. Then, make
a new one. There we go.

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:47.450 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now, I'm in. Then, I hit CMD+K to clear
this out. You notice that this is

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:50.730 line:100% position:50% align:middle
different than my normal terminal, because
I'm actually in my server now.

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:56.540 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So "ls -l", there's actually nothing in
there. But if I type "node -v",

00:05:56.540 --> 00:06:00.490 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you'll see that, ooh, now we have Node. I
can even do "Node", and then "1 + 1",

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:05.590 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and I see 2. When I need to get back out
of that, I'll hit CTRL+C twice to get back

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:10.730 line:100% position:50% align:middle
into my Bash terminal. Okay. So now, we
need to upgrade our version of Node,

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:16.070 line:100% position:50% align:middle
because it's on Version 6.10. If it is not
at least 7.6, then you need to upgrade it.

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:20.120 line:100% position:50% align:middle
The way we do that is we install a package
called "n", and n will allow us to switch

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:27.220 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to different versions on our computer. So
type "npm install n -g",

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:32.210 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and then we type "n latest". That's going
to go off and download the latest version

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:35.810 line:100% position:50% align:middle
of Node for us. Now, if we type "node -v"
it's still going to say it's Version 6.

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:41.130 line:100% position:50% align:middle
But if we type "bash", sort of like
opening up a new terminal tab,

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:47.250 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and then type "node -v", then we're in
sort of a fresh version of a tab and we

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:52.810 line:100% position:50% align:middle
now see Version 7.9. Good. So we have Node
all set up on our computer.

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:57.970 line:100% position:50% align:middle
You can clear this out. The next thing we
need to do is actually get our files onto

00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:06.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
our computer. So I'm going to move into
the "/opt". That's a nice directory to

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.310 line:100% position:50% align:middle
keep all of your applications in, and
we're going to clone our application into

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:15.020 line:100% position:50% align:middle
this folder. So if we go to GitHub here,
and we're going to Clone or Download,

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:20.990 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and I'm going to select this URL here,
"Clone with HTTPS". Click it.

00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:26.030 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Say, "git clone", paste it, and what it's
going to do, it's going to go grab a copy.

00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:32.150 line:100% position:50% align:middle
It downloads fairly quickly and you can
say, "ls -l", and you see that now we have

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:38.740 line:100% position:50% align:middle
our testing-deploy-node folder. So move
into that. Now, we have "ls -l".

00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:41.780 line:100% position:50% align:middle
There is our application. A couple things
we're missing here. First,

00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:46.060 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we don't have any of our dependencies.
Second, we don't have a varibles.env file.

00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:49.390 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So let's create both of those right now.
First, "npm install".

00:07:56.240 --> 00:08:01.830 line:100% position:50% align:middle
While I sit here and watch it try to
install webpack, and probably also will

00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:07.180 line:100% position:50% align:middle
try to install sass, I realize that npm
install could be made much quicker by

00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:13.810 line:100% position:50% align:middle
typing "npm install --production", and
that will only install our dependencies

00:08:13.810 --> 00:08:17.410 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and not our dev dependencies, which we
don't need sass on our...

00:08:17.410 --> 00:08:21.290 line:100% position:50% align:middle
It will install just fine. But there's no
need to actually have any of this

00:08:21.290 --> 00:08:25.030 line:100% position:50% align:middle
development stuff, like uglify and
whatever on our actual server,

00:08:25.030 --> 00:08:29.110 line:100% position:50% align:middle
because it's not needed in our case. So it
all finished. It puked a whole bunch of

00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:32.490 line:100% position:50% align:middle
stuff up on the screen. It adds some scary
warnings, but that's npm.

00:08:32.490 --> 00:08:36.040 line:100% position:50% align:middle
That's how you know it's done. It makes
you worried about what happened.

00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:40.820 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So that installed. The next thing we want
to do is create our variables.env file.

00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:46.170 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we'll say, "touch variables.env", and
then we will go into that.

00:08:46.170 --> 00:08:49.950 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now, we don't have an editor here, except
for vim. So we're going to be badass and

00:08:49.950 --> 00:08:55.790 line:100% position:50% align:middle
actually open up vim ourselves,
"variables.env". Now, we're in it,

00:08:55.790 --> 00:09:02.240 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and we can just go back to our existing
variables.env.now file with all of our

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:09.730 line:100% position:50% align:middle
production things in it. We paste them in,
and then you want to hit ESC ":wq".

00:09:09.730 --> 00:09:15.360 line:100% position:50% align:middle
See, at the bottom here? I hit ESC ":wq"
and hit Enter. That means "save and quit"

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:20.420 line:100% position:50% align:middle
in vim land, and then we have set that up.
So again, we npm installed.

00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:27.850 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We have our variables. I think now we can
be able just to type "npm start" and that

00:09:27.850 --> 00:09:33.360 line:100% position:50% align:middle
will kick off our start.js file. Because
we're running on Port 80,

00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:37.950 line:100% position:50% align:middle
again, Port 80 and 443, and I think one of
the other ones, those are the only ports

00:09:37.950 --> 00:09:41.410 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that are actually open on this image by
default, which is great.

00:09:41.410 --> 00:09:45.550 line:100% position:50% align:middle
You don't want to open everything else up.
So it's looking like it's up and running.

00:09:45.550 --> 00:09:50.630 line:100% position:50% align:middle
What I'm going to do is I'm going to take
the IP address of our Droplet and try to

00:09:50.630 --> 00:09:56.270 line:100% position:50% align:middle
visit it in the URL. Woo-hoo. There it is.
It's running. Obviously,

00:09:56.270 --> 00:09:59.910 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we don't have a domain name. You can do
that by going to your DigitalOcean backend

00:09:59.910 --> 00:10:05.720 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and click on Networking. You can add a
domain name in there. But you can visit it

00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:09.170 line:100% position:50% align:middle
no problem with your IP address that you
have for this server,

00:10:09.170 --> 00:10:14.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and then you can go ahead and everything
will work just as we expected it to work

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:18.760 line:100% position:50% align:middle
no problem. One thing I should say is that
if you have a bug in your code and

00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:24.670 line:100% position:50% align:middle
everything breaks, then it won't restart
itself. This is a little bit confusing to

00:10:24.670 --> 00:10:28.060 line:100% position:50% align:middle
people who are coming from PHP, where if
you break your script,

00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:31.780 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and then you just refresh the page and
it's already working again.

00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:36.230 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So what I like to do on my servers is
rather than type "npm start" directly in

00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:40.430 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the command line... Because if I have a
fatal failure and the whole application

00:10:40.430 --> 00:10:44.100 line:100% position:50% align:middle
falls over in the middle of the night, no
one is there to start it back up again.

00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:47.660 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we want to quit this, and we're going
to use something called "Forever".

00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:51.850 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Just like in development, we use Node MOM
to restart our app whenever there was a

00:10:51.850 --> 00:10:55.180 line:100% position:50% align:middle
change, what Forever will do is whenever
it senses that the application has

00:10:55.180 --> 00:10:59.920 line:100% position:50% align:middle
crashed, it will just try to start it up
again for you over and over again.

00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:03.530 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So if you do have a crash, it'll be down
for maybe a second or two,

00:11:03.530 --> 00:11:07.430 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and then it will be started up again. So
we're going to type "npm install -g",

00:11:07.430 --> 00:11:12.340 line:100% position:50% align:middle
globally, "forever". Once that is
installed, you can start your application

00:11:12.340 --> 00:11:17.010 line:100% position:50% align:middle
now. If we refresh, you'll see it's down
and we can type "forever start",

00:11:17.010 --> 00:11:21.390 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and then the name of the actual script,
"start.js", again, because we're in our

00:11:21.390 --> 00:11:28.050 line:100% position:50% align:middle
testing-deploy-node folder. I think it is
up and running now. We go back and refresh

00:11:28.050 --> 00:11:32.300 line:100% position:50% align:middle
this, and there is our application. You
can see if your script is running,

00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:36.100 line:100% position:50% align:middle
because if I were to close this tab or log
out, it would still run it in the

00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:39.760 line:100% position:50% align:middle
background. But you can always type
"forever list" and this will show you a

00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:43.560 line:100% position:50% align:middle
list of all the processes that are
running. In this case, we only have one

00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:49.040 line:100% position:50% align:middle
process and it is running Node, start.js,
and if that were to quit,

00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:52.980 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it would restart itself. What's cool about
that is you can also take those numbers,

00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:59.590 line:100% position:50% align:middle
0, say, "forever restart 0" and that will
kill your app and start it up again.

00:11:59.590 --> 00:12:05.250 line:100% position:50% align:middle
There we go. It's killed. But if I refresh
it a second later, it's back up again.

00:12:05.250 --> 00:12:11.370 line:100% position:50% align:middle
You can say, "forever logs 0", and that'll
give you any of the console.logs or any of

00:12:11.370 --> 00:12:16.010 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the errors that are happening on your
server, and you can be able to see that

00:12:16.010 --> 00:12:20.160 line:100% position:50% align:middle
really quickly as well. So that is
deploying to DigitalOcean. Pretty neat.

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:23.580 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Pretty simple. I'm a big fan of that,
especially as things start to get a little

00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:26.123 line:100% position:50% align:middle
bit more expensive with
those other services.

00:12:26.123 --> 00:12:29.123 line:100% position:50% align:middle
