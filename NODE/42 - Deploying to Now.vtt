00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.880 line:100% position:50% align:middle
First one we are going to deploy to is
something called now, and now is like a

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:21.200 line:100% position:50% align:middle
super simple way to host really any kind
of app. They are really good with Docker,

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:26.160 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Node, and Static websites, but because
they support Docker you can really host

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.860 line:100% position:50% align:middle
any type of application on it. In our case
we are going to be hosting our node app

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:35.540 line:100% position:50% align:middle
straight away on now, and they have both a
free plan as well as a premium plan.

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:39.840 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And this is by far the easiest way to get
an application up and running on the

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.100 line:100% position:50% align:middle
internet nice and quickly without having
to really worry about any of the server

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.700 line:100% position:50% align:middle
sidey stuff. So how do we do that? Well
first thing that we need to do is go back

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:53.420 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to our package.json and give now just a
little bit of information about what our

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.240 line:100% position:50% align:middle
application is going to look like. So
let's open up our package.json,

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:02.450 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and by the way, you can now change the
name of your actual thing to something

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:06.360 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that you much prefer. I said, "Dang that's
delicious," but you could call that

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.770 line:100% position:50% align:middle
something like, "Wes-loves-snacks," or you
could name it whatever you like and you

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:19.020 line:100% position:50% align:middle
can also give it a version 0.0.1. Now all
we want to do is we need to add a new

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:24.060 line:100% position:50% align:middle
object to our package.json that has stuff
that is specific to now.sh.

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.390 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So you're going to go in here and make a
now property. This is JSON this is not

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:32.580 line:100% position:50% align:middle
JavaScript so you can't just start saying
now or whatever. You have to use double

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:36.620 line:100% position:50% align:middle
quotes, "now" and that is equal to an
object, and make sure you put the quote

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:41.770 line:100% position:50% align:middle
after it. Okay so we have our now and
there is just one possible thing that we

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:47.150 line:100% position:50% align:middle
need to pass here and that's the .env, and
you can tell it where the environmental

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:52.590 line:100% position:50% align:middle
variables are going to be coming from. So
we have this variables.env file,

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.750 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and I'm going to create a new one, save it
as variables.env.now.

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.580 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And why is that? Well because we need to
put our different stuff in here.

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:05.750 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So I'm going to say this is production.
I'm going to keep the same database.

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.650 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I'm going to keep the same mail stuff.
The port is going to be 80.

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:13.160 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Map key and secret those are all going to
stay the same. Now these are the

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.040 line:100% position:50% align:middle
environmental variables that are going to
be put onto the server.

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:22.330 line:100% position:50% align:middle
However, it is not going to actually
upload this file to the server.

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:26.960 line:100% position:50% align:middle
What it will do is it will set them on the
server for us, and then when we actually

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:32.610 line:100% position:50% align:middle
deploy our process.env, .node_env,
.database, .mail_user, those are all going

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:37.110 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to be available to us. It now has a little
tool that will do that for you if you just

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:41.450 line:100% position:50% align:middle
tell it where your environmental file is.
We're going to tell it it's called

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:46.460 line:100% position:50% align:middle
variables.env.now, and again, again,
again, this variables.env.now,

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:52.940 line:100% position:50% align:middle
because we've put it in out git_ignore. It
will a, not go on github or whatever you

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:57.780 line:100% position:50% align:middle
are hosting it on, and b, it will also not
be deployed to now.sh.

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:01.980 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And that's really really important because
now.sh by default, if you have the free

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:06.700 line:100% position:50% align:middle
plan, it will make your entire application
public, an that's fine because the entire

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:11.610 line:100% position:50% align:middle
application is fine to be public except
for this stuff. You don't want to be

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:16.030 line:100% position:50% align:middle
showing like I'm showing the world right
now, but after I deploy this, I'm going to

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:22.100 line:100% position:50% align:middle
have to change all of my passwords. It
will not deploy your variables.env file or

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:26.950 line:100% position:50% align:middle
your variables.env.now file. It will just
put them on the server so that even if you

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:31.840 line:100% position:50% align:middle
have a public instance of now, which is
the free plan, it will not be open to the

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:36.380 line:100% position:50% align:middle
public. So that's how we have our .env
file. Now what you need to do is go ahead

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:40.930 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and sign up for a now account. So I have
already done that. You might have already

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:44.700 line:100% position:50% align:middle
done this because we have used
now in some of my other tutorials.

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:49.170 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So make sure you are signed up and then
you simply just need to go to your

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:53.230 line:100% position:50% align:middle
terminal. You'll need to install now
globally on your system. So the way you do

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:58.040 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that is you type NPMinstallnow-g, and what
that will do is it will install globally

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:59.990 line:100% position:50% align:middle
on your system. If you're having troubles
with permissions you could always pop a

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:04.460 line:100% position:50% align:middle
sudo in front of it, and then go figure
out how to actually fix those permissions

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:08.210 line:100% position:50% align:middle
on your computer. Then, I'm not going to
do it because I already have it,

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:11.710 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you can test if you already have it with
now-v, and that will show you which

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:16.180 line:100% position:50% align:middle
version you have and clearly you must have
a command called now there.

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:20.930 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Then you can simply go ahead and type now
and when you hit enter, it's either going

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:25.200 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to ask you to sign in with your username
and your password, or it's going to start

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:28.897 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the deploy. And type now!

00:04:31.635 --> 00:04:34.590 line:100% position:50% align:middle
It's going to give you a url,
copy it right to your clipboard

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:37.470 line:100% position:50% align:middle
so you can go ahead and view that right
now while we're waiting.

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:42.750 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And it's going to upload all of the files
that we have. It's going to prepare the

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:46.300 line:100% position:50% align:middle
container. The sync, that was really
quick. I guess because I've done this

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:50.459 line:100% position:50% align:middle
before. It generally takes, like, a minute
or two to actually upload all of your

00:04:50.459 --> 00:04:54.443 line:100% position:50% align:middle
files, and now what it's doing is it's
installing all of the different

00:04:54.443 --> 00:04:56.473 line:100% position:50% align:middle
pieces of data for us.

00:04:56.473 --> 00:05:01.540 line:100% position:50% align:middle
It just gave it a start. It's doing...see,
npm start, and then it's running the

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:05.079 line:100% position:50% align:middle
command node start. The express is running
on port 80, and the deployment is

00:05:05.079 --> 00:05:10.120 line:100% position:50% align:middle
complete. You go back here ready, visit
your website. Woohoo! There we go.

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:13.790 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Go ahead and click over to some of these.
You can see all of our data that we have

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:17.320 line:100% position:50% align:middle
here. We have all of our stores. Because
I'm using my existing data, all of my data

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:20.860 line:100% position:50% align:middle
is already there, and they'd be able to go
ahead and log in with any of the other

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:25.490 line:100% position:50% align:middle
websites that I have. So that's deploying
to now. Very, very straightforward, not a

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:28.583 line:100% position:50% align:middle
whole lot to it. Let's look at some of the
other possible options.
