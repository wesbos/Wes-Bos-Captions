In this video, we're going to be making
our store locator with Google Maps built

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.810 line:100% position:50% align:middle
in. So we're going to be making an API
endpoint that we can ping,

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.470 line:100% position:50% align:middle
given a lat and a long, and that's going
to return to us the top 10 closest stores

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:27.750 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that are within a kilometer, or 1,000
kilometers, or however much we'd like.

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.130 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So for example, if I type in "Hamilton"
because of all our demo stores are in

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.960 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Hamilton, and I hit Enter, what it's going
to do is a couple things.

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:39.660 line:100% position:50% align:middle
First, it's going to center the map on
Hamilton. Second, it's also going to take

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.370 line:100% position:50% align:middle
everything that it got from the API and
plot them as little markers on top of

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.920 line:100% position:50% align:middle
here. So that's great to be able to do
that. We need to do sort of a similar

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.510 line:100% position:50% align:middle
layout that we did to searching for our
actual stores, where we need to index our

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:57.590 line:100% position:50% align:middle
data. We need to create a route. We need
to handle it in our Store controller.

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:03.110 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Let's first open up our store.js, and
handle that indexing. So if we scroll down

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:05.770 line:100% position:50% align:middle
here, we have our index, which is our name
and our description.

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:09.610 line:100% position:50% align:middle
That's being indexed as text. Sort of
we're telling the database that this is

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:14.690 line:100% position:50% align:middle
text. What we're also going to do is we're
going to tell it that our location is

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:19.510 line:100% position:50% align:middle
going to be what's called "geospatial."
It's going to store the metadata about

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:24.920 line:100% position:50% align:middle
this location as geospatial data, and then
it's going to be able to quickly and

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:29.970 line:100% position:50% align:middle
easily search for things that are
specifically near our lat and long that we

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.680 line:100% position:50% align:middle
pass it. So we take our Store Schema, and
we call an "index" on it,

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.880 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and we are going to index the location
property. Right? Because that's what our

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:43.200 line:100% position:50% align:middle
location property is right here. We're
going to tell it to index it as a 2D

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.050 line:100% position:50% align:middle
sphere. That is because I believe the
world is round, and that will give us

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:52.660 line:100% position:50% align:middle
information about it. So I'm going to give
this a save, and we go back to our MongoDB

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:57.730 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Compass. I've found that if you click on
Users and you click Back to Stores,

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:02.200 line:100% position:50% align:middle
your indexes should now have
"location_2Dsphere" because that's our

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.330 line:100% position:50% align:middle
location. It's telling us the type is
"geospatial", pretty sweet,

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:10.570 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and then the size, the usage, and all
kinds of information specifically about

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:15.490 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that. Good. So we now have our new index
location, "2Dsphere" showing up.

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:18.640 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We want to create the route, as well as
the method to handle that route.

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.170 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So open up index.js, go all the way to the
bottom, and we'll make a

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:29.500 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"router.get('/api/stores/near',". So we're
going to search for stores that are near,

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.760 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and we're going to take our Store
controller, and we're going to run a

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.460 line:100% position:50% align:middle
method called "mapStores". Good. We'll
open up our Store controller,

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:41.960 line:100% position:50% align:middle
go all the way to the bottom here, and we
are going to make that method called

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:52.040 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"mapStores". From that, let's just
"res.json" and object, "it: 'Worked!'"

00:02:52.040 --> 00:03:01.250 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Let's see how that works. We can go to
/api/stores/near, and we get reply of "it:

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:06.700 line:100% position:50% align:middle
'Worked!'" Good. The way that we are going
to hit this endpoint is with two queries.

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:13.170 line:100% position:50% align:middle
It's going to be the lat and the long. So
if we were to "res.json(req.query)" and we

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:22.230 line:100% position:50% align:middle
go to this URL and we pass it our lat 43,
and our lng -179 and hit Enter,

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:25.990 line:100% position:50% align:middle
what that will do is we'll give us
a query of lat and long. Now,

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:32.060 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the way that MongoDB expects us to pass it
to it is it expects us to pass it an array

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:36.890 line:100% position:50% align:middle
of long and lat numbers. Okay. So let's go
up here and we'll say,

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:43.470 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"const coordinates = an array" and the
array is going to be made up the

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:51.990 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"req.query.lng", remember, weirdo, long
comes first, and then "req.query.lat".

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:56.300 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Then, let's just take that "coordinates"
and try to json back the data,

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:02.480 line:100% position:50% align:middle
just so we can see what we're working with
here. Good. It returns us an array of...

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:07.030 line:100% position:50% align:middle
These aren't really numbers. These are an
array of strings. So one little quick

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:10.160 line:100% position:50% align:middle
thing we can do is we can map over it and
pass it to "parseFloat",

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:17.510 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and that should map over every item in the
array and turn it into an actual number.

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:20.060 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now, when I refresh, that's when we get
true numbers, -179 and 43.

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:25.120 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So good. We have those coordinates here.
We can get rid of this "res.json",

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:29.120 line:100% position:50% align:middle
because we know what's going on here.
Next, we want to make our query,

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:33.260 line:100% position:50% align:middle
so that when we do store.find, we're going
to be able to pass it.

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:37.020 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Because this query, it's going to be a
healthy query. It's going to be a big

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:41.210 line:100% position:50% align:middle
query. So we need to be able to write it
in a separate object,

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:46.130 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and then pass it in. So I'll say "const q
= an object." Then, down here,

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:53.840 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we can already do the "const stores =
await Store.find(q)", and then

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:59.380 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"res.json(stores)". Okay. Good. That will
probably work without anything in our

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:03.080 line:100% position:50% align:middle
query. Let's double-check. There we go.
We've got a huge, long list of stores that

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:07.780 line:100% position:50% align:middle
are actually coming back because our query
is just a blank object.

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:11.690 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now, what we want to do is we want to
search for stores where the location

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:19.200 line:100% position:50% align:middle
property is near. Woo. Look at this. So
"near" is an operator inside of MongoDB,

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:24.020 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and it will allow us to just search for
stores that are near a certain lat and a

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:28.320 line:100% position:50% align:middle
long. There's no math that needs to happen
here, because MongoDB is wise to lat and

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:31.740 line:100% position:50% align:middle
long, and it will know exactly how to find
the ones that are near.

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:36.750 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So say it's near and we tell it we're
passing it geometry. That's another object

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:41.680 line:100% position:50% align:middle
inside of there. The type is going to be a
"point", because you could also have a

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:45.280 line:100% position:50% align:middle
fenced in area that you're searching for.
In our case, it's just "point".

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:49.860 line:100% position:50% align:middle
The coordinates is going to be equal to
our coordinates variable.

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:54.490 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Or again, we don't need to double up that,
just like that. We also want to specify

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:59.210 line:100% position:50% align:middle
what the max distance is. So,
"$maxDistance". Make sure you have the "D"

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:06.230 line:100% position:50% align:middle
there, otherwise it won't work, and
"10,000". That means 10,000 meters,

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:12.490 line:100% position:50% align:middle
which is equal to 10 kilometers. So if you
are from the United States of America,

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:18.640 line:100% position:50% align:middle
kilometers, they're sort of like miles,
but they make sense in that everything is

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:22.110 line:100% position:50% align:middle
10-based. We have meters and centimeters,
and millimeters, and kilometers,

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:26.680 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and all kinds of good stuff like that. So
if you are unsure, you'll have to do some

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:30.710 line:100% position:50% align:middle
conversion on Google to convert
it to actual kilometers. Good.

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:35.810 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So let's see now, when we refresh this, we
are looking for all of our items here.

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:42.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Randy's BBQ Joint is in the United States.
Now, if I refresh, we get nothing,

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:47.878 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and I believe that's because there is
nothing within 10 kilometers of 43, -179.

00:06:47.878 --> 00:06:51.790 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So what you can do is you can comma
that max distance out to see all of them

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:56.790 line:100% position:50% align:middle
real quick again, and you can take a...
Let's go to one that is in Hamilton,

00:06:56.790 --> 00:07:01.090 line:100% position:50% align:middle
since that's where most of these samples
ones are, -79, 43. So I believe -79.8 and

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:05.190 line:100% position:50% align:middle
43.2, let's use that as a search. So we'll
go to this page. We'll make sure that our

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:09.330 line:100% position:50% align:middle
max distance of 10 kilometers is set on,
and there we go. Now,

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:18.070 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we're only getting one, two, three, four.
We're getting all of the ones that are in

00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:24.840 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Hamilton. If you were to bring that down
to just 10 meters, you'd probably get none

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:31.900 line:100% position:50% align:middle
again. There we go. Nothing. So within 10
kilometers of this point,

00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:35.420 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it's going to show us where all
of the actual values are. Good.

00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:39.730 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we've now made this API endpoint here.
But there's a couple things going on here

00:07:39.730 --> 00:07:43.490 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that I'd like to fix. First of all, we
don't actually need all of this

00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:48.420 line:100% position:50% align:middle
information here. We only just need a
couple of different pieces of information

00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:53.620 line:100% position:50% align:middle
in our API. In general, you want to keep
your Ajax request as slim as possible.

00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:57.800 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So what do we need? We need the name, we
need the slug, we need the description,

00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:02.280 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we need the photo, and we need the
address. Everything else we don't need.

00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:07.180 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So what you can do is you can actually go
to Find and chain a .select value on it,

00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:12.650 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and you can specify either which fields
you do want or which fields you do not

00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:17.390 line:100% position:50% align:middle
want. So in our case, maybe we just want
the photo and we want the name.

00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:22.010 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So "photo name", give that a save. Now,
when I refresh this, you'll see that we

00:08:22.010 --> 00:08:26.290 line:100% position:50% align:middle
are only getting the ID, the name, and the
photo back for every single one of them.

00:08:26.290 --> 00:08:30.090 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Also, what you can do is you can take away
ones that you don't specifically want.

00:08:30.090 --> 00:08:35.280 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So if we don't want the author and we
don't want the tags, you can minus those

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:39.410 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and you see that there is no actual value
being passed here for the author or for

00:08:39.410 --> 00:08:42.720 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the tags. So that's really neat. Let's go
ahead and just select the pieces that we

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:45.830 line:100% position:50% align:middle
need. We need the slug, we need the name,
we need the description,

00:08:45.830 --> 00:08:51.010 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and we need the location. Now, when I
refresh, we have the slug,

00:08:51.010 --> 00:08:54.070 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the name, the description, and the
location. We're keeping the overhead as

00:08:54.070 --> 00:08:57.960 line:100% position:50% align:middle
small as possible, and that's going to
help make our Ajax request nice and fast

00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:03.310 line:100% position:50% align:middle
for us. Finally, we can type a ".limit" on
the end there, and we can limit it to the

00:09:03.310 --> 00:09:07.280 line:100% position:50% align:middle
closest 10. We don't want to put too many
points on our map. Of course,

00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:14.040 line:100% position:50% align:middle
all of this stuff could be configurable,
sent over via the "req.query.limit".

00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:18.100 line:100% position:50% align:middle
That is if you would like to. Now that we
actually have our API endpoint up and

00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:21.030 line:100% position:50% align:middle
running, let's actually get into writing
some frontend code again,

00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:24.650 line:100% position:50% align:middle
