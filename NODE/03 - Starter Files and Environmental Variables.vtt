00:00:11.455 --> 00:00:14.350 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Let's take a look at the starter files. If
you first crack open,

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:18.350 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you know, the package . JSON or you look
at app.js and you say,

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:23.390 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"Wes, these are the starter files? This
seems like more code than I would expect

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:28.800 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to have on the ender files," in that
stupid ender file. But what we need to

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.930 line:100% position:50% align:middle
know here is that we are going to be
building our application on something

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:39.080 line:100% position:50% align:middle
called Express. And Express is a fast,
un-opinionated, minimalist web framework

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:43.310 line:100% position:50% align:middle
for Node.js. So what is important about
that is that it's un-opinionated and it's

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:50.650 line:100% position:50% align:middle
minimalist. Meaning that it doesn't do a
whole lot by itself. So we need to pick

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:54.594 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and choose different pieces of
the Node ecosystem in order to

00:00:54.594 --> 00:00:55.900 line:100% position:50% align:middle
make things work for us.

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:01.530 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So, it's fairly common in the Node
ecosystem where nothing really comes

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.640 line:100% position:50% align:middle
batteries included. We are always working
with external modules.

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.360 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We sort of just pull out different parts
and use them together.

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.820 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now that's Express. That's what we're
going to be using here. We are using a

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:16.500 line:100% position:50% align:middle
site called Express Session to manage
sessions, we'll learn all about that.

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.980 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We are using Mongoose to work with our
MongoDB database. So that's sort of the

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:25.020 line:100% position:50% align:middle
interface for it. Then there's a couple of
other stuff here. I'm not going to go

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.450 line:100% position:50% align:middle
through absolutely everything here just
right now. But we are going to come back

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.630 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and understand like what is a cookie
parser, what is a body parser,

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:39.700 line:100% position:50% align:middle
what is passport, what is promisify, what
is error-handling strategy,

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.900 line:100% position:50% align:middle
what is our middleware? We're going to
learn all about these pieces.

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:47.600 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And rather than me sit here and explain
all of the pieces to you right now,

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.470 line:100% position:50% align:middle
what's going to happen is we're going to
learn each of these different pieces as we

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:55.820 line:100% position:50% align:middle
build our application. And as it's in
context, we're going to come back to this

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:00.670 line:100% position:50% align:middle
app.js file and understand, okay, this is
actually what it's doing.

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:07.490 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Also, what I want to tell you is that we
have a start.js file and what the start.js

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.970 line:100% position:50% align:middle
file does is first, it imports Mongoose,
which is going to be how we interface with

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:17.310 line:100% position:50% align:middle
our MongoDB. Then I've got this little if
statement here. "If you've made it this

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:23.040 line:100% position:50% align:middle
far and you are on a greater version than
Node 7.6..." This is just here to make

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.320 line:100% position:50% align:middle
sure that people don't skip this video and
start out with the old version of Node.

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:31.340 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So if you are on that, you can go ahead
and delete that, if you like.

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.840 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Then we have this thing called
"Environmental variables." Now what

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.500 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"Environmental Variables" are is,
generally, that's where you store your

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:44.370 line:100% position:50% align:middle
sensitive information. That's where you
store your passwords, and usernames,

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:50.980 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and log-ins, and API keys, and tokens, and
anything that you need to keep safe.

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:56.320 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So if we open up the variables.env... The
reason why we don't keep this in like a

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:03.570 line:100% position:50% align:middle
.txt or a .js file is that this should
never actually go into your GitHub Repo or

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:08.710 line:100% position:50% align:middle
your Git Repo at all because this is based
on the environment that you're on.

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:13.780 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we have a variables.env file that we're
going to be using on this file.

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:17.120 line:100% position:50% align:middle
But you're also going to have one of these
up on your server and then that's going to

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.970 line:100% position:50% align:middle
be in production, maybe your database will
be different, maybe your mail server will

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.720 line:100% position:50% align:middle
be different. You'll have different API
keys for all of those different ones.

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:32.100 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So what this package here does, .env, it
will take anything that is in here and

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:37.410 line:100% position:50% align:middle
allow us to access it via
process.env.thenameofthevariable. So we're

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:41.160 line:100% position:50% align:middle
going to be using that quite a bit. That's
why we put it in here.

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.930 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And when we first started off in the last
video, we renamed it as a .sample on the

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:50.340 line:100% position:50% align:middle
end. So just triple check that you do not
have a .sample on the end of that.

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:54.620 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Here is what we're doing is we are
connecting to our MongoDB instance.

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:59.660 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So earlier, we used our application,
Compass, to connect to our database.

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:03.740 line:100% position:50% align:middle
But if we actually want to interface with
it with code, MongoDB is going to connect

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:10.540 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to it. Now, we don't type in MongoDB right
here. And the reason is because that will

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:14.680 line:100% position:50% align:middle
change depending on if we're locally or if
we're in production.

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:20.920 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we say process.env.database and then
you can see that database is a variable

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:25.870 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that we have in this ENV file
and that is set in there.

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:30.060 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We are going to be using ES6 Promises in
that Mongoose so you could also use

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:35.040 line:100% position:50% align:middle
external libraries like Bluebird. But we
are going to be using the built-in one so

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:39.470 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that we can use async/await. That's why we
have to do this little line right here.

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:42.980 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And then finally, what we are doing is
we're listening for any errors that

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:46.750 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Mongoose is going to throw us. So if we're
having trouble connecting or something

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:50.380 line:100% position:50% align:middle
times out, we just want to console
log it. Where that will show up

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:53.600 line:100% position:50% align:middle
is in our terminal once we start things.

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:57.060 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Finally, we require this application here.
We're going to be getting into this whole

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:00.970 line:100% position:50% align:middle
require thing in a bit, don't worry if you
don't know it. And then we kick off our

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:06.600 line:100% position:50% align:middle
server. So let's get that started and just
make sure that everything works for us.

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:12.230 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So let's go back to our terminal here and
you type "NPM start." And what NPM start

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:16.260 line:100% position:50% align:middle
will do is, if you ever want to know what
these commands are that we're typing in,

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:22.270 line:100% position:50% align:middle
is you can open up your package.json. And
your package.json will have a script and

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:25.540 line:100% position:50% align:middle
this will contain a whole bunch of
different scripts that we can run.

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:31.710 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And in our case, we have a start which is
going to kick off another task called "NPM

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:37.760 line:100% position:50% align:middle
run watch," which is this one, Nodemon
start.js and we're going to ignore the

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:43.150 line:100% position:50% align:middle
public file. What that means is that we're
going to kick off a Node process which

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:48.840 line:100% position:50% align:middle
will start on start.js. And we're using a
package called "Nodemon" which will

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:53.200 line:100% position:50% align:middle
monitor our files. And any time there's a
change to one of our JavaScript files,

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:58.260 line:100% position:50% align:middle
this is going to kill itself and restart
the whole process, the whole server again.

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:02.150 line:100% position:50% align:middle
This is not like PHP where you simply
refresh the browser. You need to stop the

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:04.930 line:100% position:50% align:middle
process and start it again, and that's
what Nodemon will do.

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:10.700 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And then also, we are going to run assets
which is just another command that we have

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:17.720 line:100% position:50% align:middle
here, and that will kick off a web pack
task. And this is just for our CSFs in our

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:21.990 line:100% position:50% align:middle
client side JavaScript. So this assets
right here, the web pack has absolutely

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:26.610 line:100% position:50% align:middle
nothing to do with our backend process.
It's simply just there so that we can

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:33.440 line:100% position:50% align:middle
compile our SaaS into CSS and compile our
frontend JavaScript into a bundle for us.

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:36.890 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So that's what that does right there. I'm
not going to go into the web pack stuff in

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:40.580 line:100% position:50% align:middle
this course but if you're interested, I've
heavily commented the web pack.

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:45.160 line:100% position:50% align:middle
That will just go into exactly what
everything is going on in there.

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:49.090 line:100% position:50% align:middle
There's a couple of other ones in here in
terms of deployment and loading in sample

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:52.300 line:100% position:50% align:middle
data. We'll get into all of that. But for
now, I just want to make sure that we can

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:57.660 line:100% position:50% align:middle
get everything running. So when we run NPM
start, what should happen is we're kicking

00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:02.040 line:100% position:50% align:middle
off our concurrently task with the logs
that come from the computer,

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:06.250 line:100% position:50% align:middle
meaning that's coming from our node
application. And the logs that come from

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:10.260 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the box are the logs that are coming from
our web pack application.

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:16.210 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So you should see Express is running on
port 7777. And if we go to our browser

00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:22.570 line:100% position:50% align:middle
here and type in, "local host 7777," you
should see, hey, it works.

00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:27.410 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So if you've gotten that far, we will skip
to the next video and actually get into

00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:30.258 line:100% position:50% align:middle
covering some of the fundamental
concepts of this course.
