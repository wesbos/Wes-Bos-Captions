00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:17.940 line:100% position:50% align:middle
If we open up our index.js and scroll down
to where we post to /register,

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.210 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we're doing three things. We're validating
the registration data,

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.490 line:100% position:50% align:middle
done. We did that in the last video.
Second, we're going to actually register

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:28.420 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the user, or save them to our database.
And third, we're going to log them in.

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:31.810 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we've done the first piece, which is
validate register. Now what we want to do

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:35.310 line:100% position:50% align:middle
is create the second piece, which is
actually save them to the database.

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:39.740 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So I'm going to put these on their own
line here, and we are going to now put in

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:43.230 line:100% position:50% align:middle
a second one, which is
userController.register. So

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.030 line:100% position:50% align:middle
validateRegister, then we actually
register. Good. Then we'll open up our

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:51.830 line:100% position:50% align:middle
userController, scroll all the way down to
the bottom, and we'll make a new method on

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:57.230 line:100% position:50% align:middle
our exports, exports.register. We'll make
it async (req, res, and next).

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:01.790 line:100% position:50% align:middle
The reason why we are passing next here is
because it's going to be a middleware,

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:05.860 line:100% position:50% align:middle
right? The end of the road is not
register. The end of the road is actually

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.640 line:100% position:50% align:middle
logging them in, and we are just sort of
in the middle here of actually creating

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:10.820 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the user.

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:16.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we have this request response in our
next. Then from that we need to go ahead

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.360 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and create the user. So we first need to
actually import our user.

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.060 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We haven't yet actually imported it
anywhere. Oh, one sec. I see a little red

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.520 line:100% position:50% align:middle
underline here in my ESLint. I'm not sure
if you can see it. Let me just bring it up

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:35.130 line:100% position:50% align:middle
here. It says, "Unable to resolve path
module 'password-local-mongoose'.

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.170 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So what that's telling me is that
('password-local-mongoose'); is not a

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:41.360 line:100% position:50% align:middle
package. And what you can tell what the
actual name of the package is if you open

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.690 line:100% position:50% align:middle
packages.json, and you look here. It's
passport-local-mongoose,

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:51.550 line:100% position:50% align:middle
not password. So let's change that to
passport.

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:55.350 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And then finally, let's also open up our
start.js, and remember I said that you

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.160 line:100% position:50% align:middle
only ever have to import your models once?
Well, we've done that for store,

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:03.760 line:100% position:50% align:middle
but we haven't yet done that for our
actual users. So we can just duplicate

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:08.140 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that line, change it out with user. We
import our user model. So two things

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:12.650 line:100% position:50% align:middle
there. We changed this to passport, not
password, and we also imported our model.

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.140 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So let's change that down. Good.

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:20.070 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now we need to go into our userController
and get that model that we just imported.

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:26.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Go to the top here, const capital "U" User
= mongoose.model. And we'll ask for the

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
user model. Why can we do that? Because we
already imported it in start.js.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.800 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And then we also need a library called
promisify, which I'm going to go into in

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:40.580 line:100% position:50% align:middle
just a second. So we say const promisify =
require, and it's a library called

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:41.910 line:100% position:50% align:middle
('es6-promisify');. Good.

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:45.320 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now let's go down to the bottom here. And
what happens when we actually hit the

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:49.820 line:100% position:50% align:middle
register? Well, that means we successfully
passed this huge validation one,

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:53.750 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and our request.body is filled with a
Name, and Email, a Password,

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:55.780 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and then also a Confirm Password.

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:01.160 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we can go and start making our actual
user here. Say const user,

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:06.380 line:100% position:50% align:middle
lowercase "u" = new capital "U" User. And
we just need two things here.

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:10.320 line:100% position:50% align:middle
First, we need the email address, which is
stored on req.body.email.

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:15.720 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And why? Well, go to our register. You see
the name of Name, and the name of Email,

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.790 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and the name of Password? Those are what
the three things that we need are going to

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:25.560 line:100% position:50% align:middle
pass in, req.body.name, req.body.email,
req.body.password. So we have the email,

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.390 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and then we also need the name:
req.body.name.

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:31.390 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now we have that user. We haven't called
.save on it just yet,

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:35.590 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and the reason is because we're not going
to call .save on it.

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:41.880 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We're going to call .register against it.
And because .register is the actual method

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:47.930 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that will take the password that we pass
it, and hash it, and save it to our actual

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:53.350 line:100% position:50% align:middle
database. So well, where did .register
come from? Well, if we open up our User.js

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:59.310 line:100% position:50% align:middle
model, scroll to the bottom here. Remember
we did this passportLocalMongoose plugin?

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:04.790 line:100% position:50% align:middle
What that does is expose to us a method
called .register, which is going to take

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:07.700 line:100% position:50% align:middle
care of all the lower level
registration for us.

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:12.920 line:100% position:50% align:middle
You take your user model, capital "U"
User, and you call .register.

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:18.170 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And you pass it your new user that you've
created, which is our (user variable here,

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:22.040 line:100% position:50% align:middle
If that confuses you, just note that this
capital "U" User is our model,

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:25.320 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and this lowercase "u" user is the one
that we are creating right now.

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:32.850 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And then you pass it your password. So
that is req.body .password.

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:33.400 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Good.

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:37.150 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now the third thing that you're supposed
to pass register is called a callback.

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:41.380 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So you have a function here, that takes an
(err, and the actual user).

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:46.270 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And then we will work. Now this is a
little bit weird because we've been using

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:50.930 line:100% position:50% align:middle
async await for everything so far, but the
problem with this .register library is

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:55.380 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that it doesn't return a promise. It's
callback based. And this is fairly common

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:59.860 line:100% position:50% align:middle
for when you're using an external library
that doesn't use promises just yet.

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:05.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Then you have to use either their callback
or...let's just get rid of this entirely.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.360 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We're going to use promisify library which
is going to take this older callback based

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:14.970 line:100% position:50% align:middle
function and turn it into a promise based
function so we can keep using async await.

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:18.780 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So let's show you how to do that. First
thing you need to do is make the method

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:23.970 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that is promisified. So say const register
=, or we could call it

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:28.650 line:100% position:50% align:middle
registerWithPromise. That's just to show
you that we're making a version of the

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:32.920 line:100% position:50% align:middle
register method that is promisified. So
we'll just call it register for

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:38.230 line:100% position:50% align:middle
simplicity's sake. And you take promisify
and you pass it two things.

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:41.630 line:100% position:50% align:middle
First, the method that you want to
promisify, just capital "U"

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:48.240 line:100% position:50% align:middle
(User.register). And the second thing is,
because it's a method,

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:53.640 line:100% position:50% align:middle
(User.register), and not just a top-level
function, you need to pass it which object

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:55.910 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to bind to, which is capital "U" User.

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:59.830 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So if you ever are using this promisify
library, if the method that you're trying

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:06.050 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to promisify lives on an object, you also
need to pass the entire object so it knows

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:11.700 line:100% position:50% align:middle
where to bind itself to. So const register
= promisify. Now we have this register

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:17.080 line:100% position:50% align:middle
method which we can await register. We
pass it our lower case user,

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:21.130 line:100% position:50% align:middle
because that's what we're going to do. And
then you also pass it the password that

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:25.930 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you wish for it to use. So it's
req.body.password.

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:30.340 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now what's going to happen there is it's
going to take the password.

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:32.680 line:100% position:50% align:middle
It's going to take their email, and it's
going to take their name.

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:36.050 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And it's not going to store the actual
password. It's going to store what's

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:39.410 line:100% position:50% align:middle
called a hash in the database. Because as
a general rule of thumb,

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:44.360 line:100% position:50% align:middle
or as a golden rule in the universe, you
never actually store a user's password in

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:48.960 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the database, because if your database is
leaked, or it gets into the wrong hands,

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:52.570 line:100% position:50% align:middle
or you accidentally screenshot some of
that data, or whatever happens,

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:55.690 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you do not ever want your user's password
to be visible.

00:06:55.690 --> 00:07:00.810 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So what happens is, let's say your
password is dog123. The library is going

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:05.230 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to take that password and encrypt it into
something that looks like this.

00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:10.410 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now that, as far as you can tell, this is
the password that is stored in the

00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:14.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
database. Now when you come along six
months later and try to log in with

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:19.370 line:100% position:50% align:middle
dog123, it's going to also hash that
password into the same thing.

00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:23.740 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And then the library will say, if the hash
version we have on file,

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:28.990 line:100% position:50% align:middle
this is the database, and the hash version
which they provided,

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:33.880 line:100% position:50% align:middle
if they are the same thing, which they
are, then let them in. Tell them they are

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:34.330 line:100% position:50% align:middle
logged in.

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:39.260 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And if they're not, someone tries to log
in as cat123, they'll have another hash

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:44.110 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that looks like this. Hitting my pause
button. It's going to say this hash is not

00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:47.970 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the same thing as this hash. And the
beauty of that is if your database ever

00:07:47.970 --> 00:07:52.390 line:100% position:50% align:middle
gets leaked, or you get hacked, or
whatever, then all the user will see is

00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:56.680 line:100% position:50% align:middle
this piece of information, which first,
they don't know the salt,

00:07:56.680 --> 00:08:00.110 line:100% position:50% align:middle
they don't know how it's been hashed. So
they can't really reverse it.

00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:04.320 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And second, you can't reverse these at
all. You would have to just make a list of

00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:08.580 line:100% position:50% align:middle
very long possibilities and see if they
match up. So that's the beauty of that.

00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:10.550 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We are awaiting our register here.

00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:14.950 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And when everything happens successfully,
we just call that next,

00:08:14.950 --> 00:08:18.990 line:100% position:50% align:middle
which we're going to "pass to
authController.login," which we haven't

00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:23.930 line:100% position:50% align:middle
done that just yet. But before we call
next, let's just say response.send,

00:08:23.930 --> 00:08:30.080 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it works. Give this a click on Register
here. Oh, I got an error.

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:36.510 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Let's open up our terminal here. Got a bit
of an error, let's see what it says.

00:08:36.510 --> 00:08:45.940 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"Unexpected token open on index.js on line
38.index.js on line 38.

00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:51.270 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Oh, comma, comma dangle. Okay, there we
go. Give it a Save, refresh.

00:08:51.270 --> 00:08:56.410 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Okay, let's try signup now. My Name is
"Wes." My Email is "wesbos@gmail.com." My

00:08:56.410 --> 00:09:01.860 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Password is "wes," I confirm it as "wes,"
and I hit Register. And now it says it

00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:08.040 line:100% position:50% align:middle
works. Why? Because we posted our data to
register. We passed the validation.

00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:13.190 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We created a user and registered, and then
finally, we just say "it works!"

00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:17.690 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now if we did that properly, we should be
able to go to our database tooling and see

00:09:17.690 --> 00:09:20.800 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that there is a new user in there. So
let's check that out. I'm going to open up

00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:26.250 line:100% position:50% align:middle
my MongoDB Compass Beta. Going to go to my
dang-thats-delicious database.

00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:30.140 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And oh, look what we have here. We got our
7 stores, we know about that.

00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:34.050 line:100% position:50% align:middle
But now we have our users table, which has
1 in it. Is that going to be Wes that we

00:09:34.050 --> 00:09:38.540 line:100% position:50% align:middle
just created? Well, let's go to our
Documents, and let's take a look.

00:09:38.540 --> 00:09:43.160 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Yes, here is the actual thing that we just
made, name of "Wes," email of

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:47.950 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"wesbos@gmail.com." And then it has a
salt and a hash, which is going to allow

00:09:47.950 --> 00:09:53.840 line:100% position:50% align:middle
us to sort of store the password for that
user safely. And then of course,

00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:58.220 line:100% position:50% align:middle
every document in MongoDB has a unique
identifier along with it.

00:09:58.220 --> 00:10:03.370 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now let's finally do the last part which
is we need to actually log them in,

00:10:03.370 --> 00:10:07.560 line:100% position:50% align:middle
because they validated it, they registered
themselves. And then let's just

00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:10.610 line:100% position:50% align:middle
automatically log them in. I like when
websites do that. After you've created an

00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:13.820 line:100% position:50% align:middle
account, you can automatically log
yourself in. So to do that,

00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:16.730 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we're going to create a third controller
called our authController.

00:10:16.730 --> 00:10:20.500 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And our authController is going to handle
all of the logging in,

00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:24.170 line:100% position:50% align:middle
all of our passport.js stuff, it's going
to handle all the passwords resets and

00:10:24.170 --> 00:10:30.150 line:100% position:50% align:middle
email sending. All that stuff that is
specifically related to logging in and

00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:33.200 line:100% position:50% align:middle
being authenticated rather
than just with the user.

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:36.540 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we'll go into our controllers here.
We'll create a new file called

00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:41.750 line:100% position:50% align:middle
authController.js. Then we need to import
one thing that's called passport,

00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:47.640 line:100% position:50% align:middle
const passport = require('passport');. And
again, passport is the library that we're

00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:53.340 line:100% position:50% align:middle
using to log everybody in. The one thing
that we haven't done is the ability to

00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:57.610 line:100% position:50% align:middle
send passport data and tell us if we
should be logged in or not.

00:10:57.610 --> 00:11:00.430 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And that's what's called a strategy in
passport. A strategy is essentially

00:11:00.430 --> 00:11:05.560 line:100% position:50% align:middle
something that will interface with
checking if you're allowed

00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:06.960 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to be logged in.

00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:11.030 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So there could be a strategy for Facebook
that's going to check with Facebook if

00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:14.490 line:100% position:50% align:middle
they have the correct tokens. In our case,
we're going to be using what's called a

00:11:14.490 --> 00:11:18.080 line:100% position:50% align:middle
local strategy, and a local strategy is
going to check if our username and

00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:21.240 line:100% position:50% align:middle
password has been sent in correctly. So
what we'll do is we're going to create a

00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:25.970 line:100% position:50% align:middle
middleware here. We'll say exports.login
=. Now this isn't the normal request

00:11:25.970 --> 00:11:29.360 line:100% position:50% align:middle
response that we're used to. What we're
going to be doing is we're taking

00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:32.960 line:100% position:50% align:middle
advantage of some of the middleware that
comes with passport. So we'll say

00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:37.310 line:100% position:50% align:middle
passport.authenticate. And you at first
tell it which type of strategy you want.

00:11:37.310 --> 00:11:41.830 line:100% position:50% align:middle
You say local. And you could also say
('facebook'), or ('github'),

00:11:41.830 --> 00:11:45.470 line:100% position:50% align:middle
or whatever it is. But we're going to be
using a local, which allows us to use a

00:11:45.470 --> 00:11:46.420 line:100% position:50% align:middle
username and a password.

00:11:46.420 --> 00:11:50.560 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And then the second thing that you pass it
is a config object that will tell us a

00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:55.580 line:100% position:50% align:middle
little bit of data about what to happen.
So first thing is, if there is a failure,

00:11:55.580 --> 00:11:57.430 line:100% position:50% align:middle
where should they go? So we'll say
failureRedirect. And if that is,

00:11:57.430 --> 00:12:03.910 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we'll just redirect them to login. And
then we'll also say failureFlash.

00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:08.570 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And if there is a failure, you should
flash the message 'Failed Login!' So

00:12:08.570 --> 00:12:13.240 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that's nice. If the passport is not
authenticated, it will just redirect them

00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:16.570 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and flash them. So that's nice, we don't
even have to handle any of the redirects

00:12:16.570 --> 00:12:19.930 line:100% position:50% align:middle
ourselves. We just tell it what to do. And
then we tell it some success stuff,

00:12:19.930 --> 00:12:24.590 line:100% position:50% align:middle
successRedirect. If they successfully go
to the home page, and then we also want to

00:12:24.590 --> 00:12:29.070 line:100% position:50% align:middle
successfully flash them. 'You are now
logged in!'

00:12:29.070 --> 00:12:31.400 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We've created our login function. Now
let's go and hook it up.

00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:35.380 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We'll go back to our routes in index.js.
We validateRegister, and finally,

00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:40.620 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we are going to authController.login. Of
course, we need to import that first,

00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:43.630 line:100% position:50% align:middle
so go to the top here. We have our
storeController, we have our

00:12:43.630 --> 00:12:47.880 line:100% position:50% align:middle
userController. So just duplicate that
line and take our user,

00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:50.750 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and replace it with auth. Good.

00:12:50.750 --> 00:12:54.810 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Then let's go back to our userController.
We still have this res.send,

00:12:54.810 --> 00:12:59.470 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it works. We don't want to stop it from
continuing down the line so we'll take

00:12:59.470 --> 00:13:03.800 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that out. Why? Because next we'll call for
the next one in line,

00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:08.040 line:100% position:50% align:middle
right? I know I've said this 1,000 times,
but we validate, then we register,

00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:11.100 line:100% position:50% align:middle
then we go to authController, which will
allow us to log in. Good.

00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:14.220 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I know this is a whole lot, but we got one
more piece to do, and that's that we

00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:17.740 line:100% position:50% align:middle
actually need to configure passport in
order to use local, right?

00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:21.770 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Because before you use any of these
strategies here, we actually need to

00:13:21.770 --> 00:13:25.050 line:100% position:50% align:middle
configure them in our application. So
before you use Facebook,

00:13:25.050 --> 00:13:27.670 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you need to give them the correct Facebook
tokens. Before you use GitHub,

00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:31.360 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you need to give them your OAuth tokens.
Before you use a local,

00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:36.004 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you need to tell it what to do with the
actual users once they've

00:13:36.004 --> 00:13:37.090 line:100% position:50% align:middle
signed in, right?

00:13:37.090 --> 00:13:41.250 line:100% position:50% align:middle
In our case, what it's going to do is it's
going to put the user object on each

00:13:41.250 --> 00:13:45.690 line:100% position:50% align:middle
request. So we need to create one more
file, and if we open up our handlers here,

00:13:45.690 --> 00:13:50.280 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we have errorHandlers. We're also going to
create one more file called passport.js.

00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:54.110 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And this is just a handler that will
configure our actual passport.

00:13:54.110 --> 00:13:59.280 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we need to import passport. We need to
import Mongoose. We need our user model.

00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:05.450 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Then we simply say passport.use, and we
say (User), capital "U"

00:14:05.450 --> 00:14:09.370 line:100% position:50% align:middle
(User.createStrategy());. And the reason
why we can do that is because we've used

00:14:09.370 --> 00:14:12.490 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that plugin in our user.js.

00:14:12.490 --> 00:14:15.490 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Then we need to tell passport what to do
with the actual user.

00:14:15.490 --> 00:14:19.520 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Because what's going to happen is we're
going to log in to passport and it's going

00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:24.860 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to say, "Okay, now what? What information
would you like on each request?" And in

00:14:24.860 --> 00:14:29.490 line:100% position:50% align:middle
our case, we just want to pass along the
actual user object so we can do things

00:14:29.490 --> 00:14:33.970 line:100% position:50% align:middle
like put their avatar in the top
right-hand corner, and show the stores

00:14:33.970 --> 00:14:37.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that they've created. And we want to do
stuff specific to that user.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:44.480 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we take our passport and we say
serializeUser. And we take the (User and

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:51.910 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we say serializeUser());. And
passport.deserialize will do the same

00:14:51.910 --> 00:14:58.960 line:100% position:50% align:middle
thing, deserializeUser());. Good. So
again, what this will do is every single

00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:02.540 line:100% position:50% align:middle
time you have your request, it's going to
ask passport, "What should I do with the

00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:07.120 line:100% position:50% align:middle
actual user now that I've confirmed that
they are properly logged in?" We need to

00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:11.170 line:100% position:50% align:middle
take this passport.js and actually import
it somewhere in our application.

00:15:11.170 --> 00:15:15.310 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we'll go to app.js. So we haven't
edited app.js yet, but we'll put it up

00:15:15.310 --> 00:15:22.320 line:100% position:50% align:middle
here, and we'll simply just require('.
/handlers/passport');, and that will just

00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:25.910 line:100% position:50% align:middle
invoke the code that lives inside of here.
You probably could have also done that

00:15:25.910 --> 00:15:29.700 line:100% position:50% align:middle
right in line here, but I like to have it
in separate files just so that we know we

00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:31.810 line:100% position:50% align:middle
are configuring everything.

00:15:31.810 --> 00:15:34.120 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Good, so I know that was a lot. Let's
actually go ahead and try it.

00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:37.330 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We'll click on our Register page here, and
we'll try create user.

00:15:37.330 --> 00:15:41.140 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Make sure that your MongoDB you refresh if
there's anything in there,

00:15:41.140 --> 00:15:45.510 line:100% position:50% align:middle
making sure you delete it, because you
can't sign up with the same email twice.

00:15:45.510 --> 00:15:49.430 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So Delete. I'm going to try to register.
Then we'll go ahead and try it.

00:15:49.430 --> 00:15:57.290 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"Wes, gmail." Now if this works properly,
what should happen is that we are posting

00:15:57.290 --> 00:16:00.250 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to register. So I validate myself. It
should actually register me.

00:16:00.250 --> 00:16:06.330 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And then it should log me in. So go ahead
and click on Register.

00:16:06.330 --> 00:16:12.280 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Woo-hoo, it worked! Look it, "You are now
logged in!" Good. And then it has

00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:16.580 line:100% position:50% align:middle
redirected me to the homepage because I
know that it has actually worked.

00:16:16.580 --> 00:16:21.210 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Good. And we go back to our MongoDB and
refresh, you see that that's our actual

00:16:21.210 --> 00:16:21.960 line:100% position:50% align:middle
user.

00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:25.470 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So in the next video what we're going to
do is we're going to actually hook up this

00:16:25.470 --> 00:16:28.990 line:100% position:50% align:middle
log out button. We're going to work on
getting our photo to show up here,

00:16:28.990 --> 00:16:32.950 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and a couple of other general housekeeping
stuff now that we have the concept of the

00:16:32.950 --> 00:16:35.008 line:100% position:50% align:middle
user being shown.

00:16:35.008 --> 00:16:38.008 line:100% position:50% align:middle
