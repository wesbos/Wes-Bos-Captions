00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:12.720 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Let's talk about one of the fundamental
concepts behind Express,

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:16.840 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it is routing. And this will happen in any
application that you're working on.

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:21.850 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Essentially, when people go to a URL, you
need to do stuff. You need to query the

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:26.210 line:100% position:50% align:middle
database, you need to filter through a
list of stores, you need to modify that

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:31.030 line:100% position:50% align:middle
data in some way, and finally, once you
have all of the data that you want to send

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:34.910 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to the user, you send it to them. So the
way that the router works in Express is

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:39.180 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that you...first you import Express, then
you grab the router off of Express,

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.840 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that's how we've done it here. We'll talk
more about these importing and exporting

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.700 line:100% position:50% align:middle
in future videos. And then you go ahead
and define all of your routes. Now,

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:51.860 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I'm defining all of our routes in
index.js, and you can see that we're using

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:57.650 line:100% position:50% align:middle
those routes because if we go and look for
index, here we go, const routes = require,

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:02.630 line:100% position:50% align:middle
here what we're doing is we're importing
our routes from this file here and we're

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:07.380 line:100% position:50% align:middle
exporting the router from there. And then
we go ahead and tell Express to use that

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.555 line:100% position:50% align:middle
right here.

00:01:08.555 --> 00:01:14.881 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we say, anytime someone goes
to "/anything" then we will hit this route

00:01:14.881 --> 00:01:20.690 line:100% position:50% align:middle
file and the route file here is going to
handle every single URL hit that we get.

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:24.660 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now you could have multiple route handlers
here, you could have a second one.

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:26.747 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Sometimes I'll do a
second file for admin

00:01:26.747 --> 00:01:29.788 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and I'll make that like
admin routes, and then any

00:01:29.788 --> 00:01:35.240 line:100% position:50% align:middle
routes that go to "/admin" "/anything"
we'll handle in that separate router. But

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.280 line:100% position:50% align:middle
here, we're going to do it all in one file
here. And this is how the router works,

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:44.110 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you get the URL and then you have a
callback function that will run whenever

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:49.080 line:100% position:50% align:middle
somebody visits that specific URL. That
function is going to give you three

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:54.180 line:100% position:50% align:middle
things. The request, which is an object
full of information that's coming in,

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:59.530 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you have a response, which is an object
full of methods for sending data back to

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:03.140 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the user. And then we have a third one
that's going to be called next and we're

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.790 line:100% position:50% align:middle
going to review that in our
middleware file because it's possible that

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:10.440 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you do not want to send data back at this
route or you just want to sort of pass it

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.910 line:100% position:50% align:middle
off to somebody else to handle.

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:15.240 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So here we have our function here. If
you've never seen this,

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.560 line:100% position:50% align:middle
this is just a normal function but I've
swapped it out with an arrow function. But

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.070 line:100% position:50% align:middle
if you've taken the ES6 class, you know
all about that. And then we immediately

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:27.600 line:100% position:50% align:middle
just send back, "Hey, it works." But we
can do a lot more work in here,

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.176 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you can console.log, "Hey!!!"

00:02:29.176 --> 00:02:32.804 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now, when you refresh this,
it's still the same, but if we were to go

00:02:32.804 --> 00:02:36.560 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to our terminal here, you'll see that we
have console.logged, "Hey!!!"

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.610 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So that means that anytime you
console.log inside of an Express

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.720 line:100% position:50% align:middle
application, you're going to see
it in your actual terminal here,

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.070 line:100% position:50% align:middle
so we see, "Hey!!!"

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:51.422 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now, what can we do with
this? Obviously, we can do "request.send",

00:02:51.422 --> 00:02:56.120 line:100% position:50% align:middle
send is one of the methods that we can
possibly use to send data.

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.580 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And we can also use it to send JSON back,
so let's say you have an object,

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:04.177 line:100% position:50% align:middle
so "const wes =" you have
a name, it's Wes,

00:03:04.177 --> 00:03:09.709 line:100% position:50% align:middle
age is 100, cool is a
billion of true. And I want to send

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:15.450 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that data back as JSON because maybe we're
making a cool API. So what we do is we

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:19.465 line:100% position:50% align:middle
take that variable, we comment out this
request.send. So make sure that you're

00:03:19.465 --> 00:03:21.981 line:100% position:50% align:middle
never trying to send data
more than once. So if I

00:03:21.981 --> 00:03:23.950 line:100% position:50% align:middle
was going to say request
and the method we

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:30.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
want here is JSON, res.json(wes). Now
we're trying to send data twice and you're

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.990 line:100% position:50% align:middle
going to get an error that says, "Headers
are already sent," because you've already

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.785 line:100% position:50% align:middle
sent the request.

00:03:34.785 --> 00:03:36.993 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So if you ever get that error,
that's because you've tried to send data

00:03:36.993 --> 00:03:41.760 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to the browser twice. So take that
one out. We're going to JSON that. And

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:46.600 line:100% position:50% align:middle
now when you refresh, you'll see that the
browser has sent us back and it's

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:49.957 line:100% position:50% align:middle
populated all the correct headers and
everything and it's formatted it as

00:03:49.957 --> 00:03:51.141 line:100% position:50% align:middle
actual JSON.

00:03:51.141 --> 00:03:56.046 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I'm using a little Chrome plugin here,
JSON Formatter, to highlight my JavaScript

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:01.070 line:100% position:50% align:middle
but it has been pushed as JSON, which
we're going to do a lot in this course,

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:04.820 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we're going to be able to push out data as
JSON and then on the client-side we're

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:08.282 line:100% position:50% align:middle
going to be able to use AJAX
to request that actual data.

00:04:08.282 --> 00:04:14.420 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So request.send and request.json are the
two most basic ones, but we can also do a

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:20.660 line:100% position:50% align:middle
little bit more here where we can pull in
data from the URL. So let's say we are on

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:28.010 line:100% position:50% align:middle
this URL here and it had some query
parameters like name=wes, ampersand,

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:34.520 line:100% position:50% align:middle
age=100, and I [inaudible] to hit Enter.
How do I get the data that's in the URL?

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:40.110 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Well, that's part of the request, so
we can get that data by...let's comment

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:41.036 line:100% position:50% align:middle
out this stuff again.

00:04:41.036 --> 00:04:45.703 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We could say request a
response.send, and the data is available

00:04:45.703 --> 00:04:53.760 line:100% position:50% align:middle
on "request.query.", and then the actual
parameter that we want. So, a name.

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:58.320 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So let's see if we can get that, there we
go. So now because the name is Wes, it's

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:03.271 line:100% position:50% align:middle
going to send Wes, and if I change that to
Kate, it's obviously going to change

00:05:03.271 --> 00:05:04.243 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to Kate.

00:05:04.243 --> 00:05:09.080 line:100% position:50% align:middle
You could also take the response.json
and simply just send back the data

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:13.790 line:100% position:50% align:middle
immediately. So "request.query" is an
object full of all of the query parameters

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:19.430 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and we just passed that directly to JSON.
So now any of the data that gets passed is

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:28.003 line:100% position:50% align:middle
automatically just echoed back in JSON,
age=100, and cool=true. And you see that

00:05:28.003 --> 00:05:33.367 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we're just echoing the data back to it.
So that is a "request.query".

00:05:33.367 --> 00:05:36.595 line:100% position:50% align:middle
That gives us all of the data,
and the reason why we have

00:05:36.595 --> 00:05:43.462 line:100% position:50% align:middle
this query property on a request, is if
we head back to app.js, I said that we

00:05:43.462 --> 00:05:48.780 line:100% position:50% align:middle
would sort of like go back to this app.js
whenever we're using. You'll see online

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:56.050 line:100% position:50% align:middle
27, 28-ish, you'll see bodyParser.json
and bodyParser.url in the code.

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:59.300 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So what this is allowing us to do, this
is a concept called middleware which we're

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:03.780 line:100% position:50% align:middle
going to run into in just a couple of
videos, and what that does is before we

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:08.362 line:100% position:50% align:middle
even hit these routes right here, what
Express is going to do, is it's going to

00:06:08.362 --> 00:06:11.138 line:100% position:50% align:middle
check the URL and it's
going to check if anyone

00:06:11.138 --> 00:06:13.658 line:100% position:50% align:middle
has posted data from
like a form element

00:06:13.658 --> 00:06:18.940 line:100% position:50% align:middle
or something like that, and it's going to
sort of put all the data in the request so

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:24.780 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we can easily access it via saying things
like request.query or request.body. Or

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:29.280 line:100% position:50% align:middle
let's talk about a third one, which is
request.params. Let's make a new route

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:35.090 line:100% position:50% align:middle
here, router.get, and let's just say
reverse/. Now, I want to make

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:40.410 line:100% position:50% align:middle
an end point here where you hit a URL and
then you say "reverse/Wes" and it will

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:46.960 line:100% position:50% align:middle
give you seW, it will reverse whatever
your name is. So how do we put variables

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:51.790 line:100% position:50% align:middle
in a route? A way you do that is you put a
colon and then you put a name, and that's

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:56.640 line:100% position:50% align:middle
going to give us a name variable on each
of our requests. So we can run a function

00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:01.200 line:100% position:50% align:middle
here, so we have our request, we have a
response, and from that, let's just test

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:04.660 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that it's working. So we'll
say "response.send". It works.

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:15.030 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now we'll go to our URL here and our route
was /reverse/Wes, and it says it works,

00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:20.580 line:100% position:50% align:middle
good. Now, how do I access this part of
the URL, Wes? Well, that's stored in the

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:24.930 line:100% position:50% align:middle
request, obviously, because, again, all of
the data about our request is stored in

00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:29.050 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the request variable and we can just try
to send it back immediately.

00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:33.800 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So res.params, because that
will be an object containing all of it.

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:38.680 line:100% position:50% align:middle
You could have multiple, name,
last name, and cool, etc., etc., but

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:40.847 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we just have name,
request.params.name.

00:07:40.847 --> 00:07:42.572 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Let's see if we can
send that back.

00:07:45.231 --> 00:07:47.149 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We've got a bit of an
error here, so if you ever

00:07:47.149 --> 00:07:53.870 line:100% position:50% align:middle
see this like it's not working, what that
means is that your Express application is

00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:58.930 line:100% position:50% align:middle
in the process of restarting. So if you
try to refresh too quickly, it means it

00:07:58.930 --> 00:08:00.482 line:100% position:50% align:middle
hasn't restarted totally.

00:08:00.482 --> 00:08:03.397 line:100% position:50% align:middle
But if it doesn't
restart ever, you have to go back to your

00:08:03.397 --> 00:08:08.157 line:100% position:50% align:middle
console here and see maybe there was a
syntax error or something like that, and

00:08:08.157 --> 00:08:10.441 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it will give you some
information about that

00:08:10.441 --> 00:08:12.730 line:100% position:50% align:middle
happening here.
So, refresh, it will tell

00:08:12.730 --> 00:08:14.829 line:100% position:50% align:middle
me Wes, I'll give it kait.

00:08:14.829 --> 00:08:18.748 line:100% position:50% align:middle
If I give it racecar,
you'll see that it's all working. Cool.

00:08:18.748 --> 00:08:24.370 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So what we could do is make a little end
point here that would simply take in a

00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:30.350 line:100% position:50% align:middle
name and reverse it. So it's a const
reverse =, and we're going to

00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:31.308 line:100% position:50% align:middle
split that string.

00:08:31.308 --> 00:08:36.028 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So req.params.name, we're going
to make that into an array. If you're

00:08:36.028 --> 00:08:40.895 line:100% position:50% align:middle
wondering what this is, check my ES6
videos. We are going to reverse that array

00:08:40.895 --> 00:08:46.600 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and then join it back together. So then we
take the reverse that we have here and

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:53.130 line:100% position:50% align:middle
just send it,. So now if I type in Wes,
do we get seW? Yes, we do.

00:08:53.130 --> 00:09:02.129 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Type in kait. Tiak. I love you. uoy evol
I. Or racecar, it should still say

00:09:02.129 --> 00:09:03.368 line:100% position:50% align:middle
racecar.

00:09:03.368 --> 00:09:07.720 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Good. So we learned a couple things here.
Request has all the information,

00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:13.690 line:100% position:50% align:middle
response has all the methods for
sending data back, and we have

00:09:13.690 --> 00:09:16.970 line:100% position:50% align:middle
request.query to get the query
parameters, we have something called

00:09:16.970 --> 00:09:21.570 line:100% position:50% align:middle
request.body, which we'll be using for
posted parameters, and then we have a

00:09:21.570 --> 00:09:24.790 line:100% position:50% align:middle
request.params in order to access
the things that are in the URL.

00:09:24.790 --> 00:09:30.420 line:100% position:50% align:middle
All of the stuff is in the Express
documentation, so if you need to look it

00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:34.260 line:100% position:50% align:middle
up or you want to see what else there is,
go to the Express docs. In the sidebar,

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:37.963 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you're going to see the request, the
response, and you can open that up.

00:09:37.963 --> 00:09:42.030 line:100% position:50% align:middle
You can see all the information, see, here
we go, they have a param called ID.

00:09:42.030 --> 00:09:46.360 line:100% position:50% align:middle
request.params.id. You can see, go
to response and you can see all the

00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:52.190 line:100% position:50% align:middle
different methods that live on response,
you know, open it up, here we go,

00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:57.440 line:100% position:50% align:middle
so request.json, jsonp, links, location,
redirect if you want to redirect someone

00:09:57.440 --> 00:10:02.600 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to a new page. Render, that's coming up in
the next video. You could send a file,

00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:06.660 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you could set a status, etc., etc. There's
all kinds of good stuff here, but in

00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:11.200 line:100% position:50% align:middle
general, you're going to be using
response.json and something called

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:14.225 line:100% position:50% align:middle
response.render, which we're going to
hit in the next video.

00:10:14.225 --> 00:10:16.542 line:100% position:50% align:middle
