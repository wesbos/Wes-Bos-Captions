00:00:11.834 --> 00:00:15.106 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Let's get rocking on our
search here. So if I right-click,

00:00:15.106 --> 00:00:18.560 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"Inspect" on this, you
have a div with a class of search.

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.540 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Inside of that we have an input, and then
we have a hidden div that has search

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:29.010 line:100% position:50% align:middle
results inside of it. So what we want to
do is open up our public folder,

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.860 line:100% position:50% align:middle
open up our JavaScripts folder, and then
in our modules we're going to make a new

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:40.710 line:100% position:50% align:middle
file called typeAhead, capital A, .js.
Then inside of that we're going to import

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:47.420 line:100% position:50% align:middle
a library called axios, "const axios =
require('axios');". And axios is a library

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.530 line:100% position:50% align:middle
sort of like fetch built into the browser,
but with some sane defaults and some nice

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.920 line:100% position:50% align:middle
ability to cancel requests if you ever
want to implement something like that.

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.160 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Then we're going to make a function called
typeAhead, which will take in the search

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:05.090 line:100% position:50% align:middle
box. And it's going to be exported from
this file. Good. Then we'll open up our

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:10.050 line:100% position:50% align:middle
main delicious-app and we will import
that. We'll put it above here,

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:15.270 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"import typeAhead from '.
/modules/typeAhead';". Then we will run it

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:21.740 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and we'll say, "typeAhead",
and we will pass it "$('.search')".

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.260 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Good. So we'll see if it worked. We'll go
inside of our typeAhead and just

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.750 line:100% position:50% align:middle
console.log search. Make sure that
everything is up and running before we

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:33.230 line:100% position:50% align:middle
start writing some real code. When I
refresh we get a div with a class of

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:39.590 line:100% position:50% align:middle
search. Good. So essentially how this is
going to work is we are going to listen

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:44.260 line:100% position:50% align:middle
for when somebody types into this box
here. And when somebody types into this

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:50.670 line:100% position:50% align:middle
box, we are going to hit our API endpoint
with the value that's typed into that box,

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.350 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and then wait for the results to come
back, and then we can make some drop-down

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.770 line:100% position:50% align:middle
value here. So let's do the very basics,
which is when somebody types in the box,

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:03.100 line:100% position:50% align:middle
let's console.log what they typed. Delete
this. First thing we want to do is say,

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.870 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"If there is no search, then we are just
going to return." And what that will do is

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:12.060 line:100% position:50% align:middle
if, for whatever reason, the search is not
on the page, then we don't want to run

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.430 line:100% position:50% align:middle
this function at all. And that will stop
any of these "cannot find query selector

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:23.440 line:100% position:50% align:middle
of", etc., etc. So first thing we need is
we need the input and we need the results.

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:29.200 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So what we do here is you say, "const
searchInput =". We'll take our search and

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:37.230 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we will querySelector inside of that for
our input with the name of search.

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:44.680 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Then we also need our results div,
"search__results". Good. So we have our

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.180 line:100% position:50% align:middle
two pieces of information that we're
looking for here, let's quickly

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:53.410 line:100% position:50% align:middle
console.log them to searchInput and
searchResults. Let's double-check that we

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:58.100 line:100% position:50% align:middle
have those values on page load. There's
our input, there's our results.

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:03.300 line:100% position:50% align:middle
It's zero pixels high because we are not
showing anything in it right now.

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:07.980 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Good. Okay, then what we need to do is
listen for an input event on that search.

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:13.870 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we'll say, "searchInput.on('input')".
And again, "on" is just a shortcut in

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:19.220 line:100% position:50% align:middle
bling.js for addEventListener. But we are
just using "on" because we are cool.

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:24.250 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And when the input function runs, we are
going to run this callback.

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:29.650 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Which in here we'll just console.log
this.value. And once you type C-O-F-F-E-E,

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:33.020 line:100% position:50% align:middle
good. So we are listening for an input
event on the searchInput.

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:36.470 line:100% position:50% align:middle
When that happens, we are using
this.value, which will give us the actual

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:45.790 line:100% position:50% align:middle
value of here. Good. What we do want to do
is immediately, if there is no value

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:51.050 line:100% position:50% align:middle
inside of that, we just want to hide the
search results and return.

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:55.850 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Because, and we'll just put a little
comment, "if there is no value,

00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:00.710 line:100% position:50% align:middle
quit it". So if somebody is typing in
here, and then they backspace it all,

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:04.600 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we should get rid of any search results
that we do have as well as stop this thing

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:08.270 line:100% position:50% align:middle
from running because there's nothing to
search for. So how do we do that?

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:13.690 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We take our search results and we grab the
style.display property and we set that to

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:18.410 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"none", which will hide it. And then we
also return, which will stop.

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:23.850 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Okay, good. Then what we want to do is
show the search result.

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:27.170 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So, "searchResults.style.display =",
we want to make it "block".

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:30.070 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So if it was hidden from before, we want
to now make it block.

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:36.650 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And then we use axios to hit our endpoint.
So, "axios", ".get".

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:43.050 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now what is our URL? "/api/search"," and
then the query parameter is going to be

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:51.980 line:100% position:50% align:middle
set to this.value. Then we chain a .then
on the end, which gives us our response.

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:57.890 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And let's just do a quick console.log,
res.data. So if I type C,

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:05.330 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we get an empty array. O-F-F-E-E. And as
soon as I did my first letter,

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:09.660 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you see that these are all empty coming
back? But as soon as I hit "coffee",

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:13.240 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it comes back with three objects from our
actual API. Very good,

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:19.330 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I'm really happy with that. So we have our
res.data coming back to us.

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:23.950 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Then inside of here we'll say, "If there
is any data that has come back,

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:32.530 line:100% position:50% align:middle
so res.data.length, then we will
console.log 'There is something to show!'"

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:38.770 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So now are we going to see anything?
C-O-F-F-E-E. And then as soon as we hit

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:42.430 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the "coffee", the data comes back and
says, "Yes, there actually are some

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:47.510 line:100% position:50% align:middle
results for coffee." Let's go ahead and do
that. So at this point we need to start

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:54.670 line:100% position:50% align:middle
making some results HTML to actually
display to our users. Let me open up the

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:57.770 line:100% position:50% align:middle
actual finished version to show you kind
of what we're going for here.

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:00.120 line:100% position:50% align:middle
This is our finished version here. So as
soon as I hit "coffee",

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:05.920 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you see how as I type C-O-F-F-E-E there's
nothing? And as soon as I hit "coffee",

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:11.220 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it's going to start showing us the results
here. And I can use my arrow keys to go up

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:14.410 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and down to all the different versions
that we have. And when I hit "enter",

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:20.510 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it's going to bring me to the actual URL
for that one. Good. So rather than make

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:23.420 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the HTML write inside of this function,
this is getting a little bit harry,

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:26.880 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I'm going to go to the top here and I'm
going to make a second function that's

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:31.590 line:100% position:50% align:middle
called searchResultsHTML. So it's a
function, searchResultsHTML.

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:38.480 line:100% position:50% align:middle
It's going to take in an array of stores
and it's going to return to us some HTML.

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:42.800 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now if you take in either my ES6 or my
JavaScript 30 course, you'll be fairly

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:47.250 line:100% position:50% align:middle
familiar with this. We're just going to
return the stores and we're going to map

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:54.420 line:100% position:50% align:middle
over each store. And from that we are
going to return, backticks.

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:59.480 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And each of those stores has "a" with a
class of .search__result,

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:08.740 line:100% position:50% align:middle
singular. And the "a href" is going to be
equal to "/stores/${store.slug}".

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:14.500 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Good. And inside of that we are going to
give ourselves a strong tag which has the

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:20.350 line:100% position:50% align:middle
store.name inside of it. Alternatively,
you can also give yourself a paragraph tag

00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:24.430 line:100% position:50% align:middle
which has the store.description inside of
it. But I'm going to leave that off for

00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:28.900 line:100% position:50% align:middle
now because I think it clutters up our
search a little bit too much.

00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:33.670 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So this searchResultsHTML is now a nice
little function that we can use to map

00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:38.660 line:100% position:50% align:middle
over each stores, return some HTML for
each one, and then on the end of this one

00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:44.220 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we can call .join because this map is
going to return to us an array and we

00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:47.600 line:100% position:50% align:middle
really just want a string. Here, let me
show you what it looks like without it.

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:54.570 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we'll go down here and I'll say, "const
HTML = searchResultsHTML(res.data);".

00:07:54.570 --> 00:07:59.420 line:100% position:50% align:middle
That's going to be the array of stores.
And let's just console.log the HTML for

00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:05.150 line:100% position:50% align:middle
each of those. So watch what happens now
when I search for coffee.

00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:11.030 line:100% position:50% align:middle
What comes back is a list of stores,
res.data. We pass that into our

00:08:11.030 --> 00:08:17.400 line:100% position:50% align:middle
searchResultsHTML. And then from that we
get an array of three pieces of HTML,

00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:23.970 line:100% position:50% align:middle
each with a link and a strong tag inside
of it. But we don't want an array,

00:08:23.970 --> 00:08:30.960 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we just want one big chunk of HTML. So I
can call .join on the end here and that is

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:36.680 line:100% position:50% align:middle
going to give us, there we go, nice actual
HTML, one string rather than an array of

00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:41.920 line:100% position:50% align:middle
three strings. Good. At this point we just
take our searchResults and we set the

00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:46.830 line:100% position:50% align:middle
innerHTML to be the HTML that we have
there. Or what you can do is you can just

00:08:46.830 --> 00:08:51.330 line:100% position:50% align:middle
take this function here and set the result
to be that right away.

00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:54.920 line:100% position:50% align:middle
It's not necessary to put in a variable if
you're just doing it in one line.

00:08:54.920 --> 00:09:00.290 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now if I search for coffee, C-O-F-F-E-E.
And as soon as I hit "coffee",

00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:05.050 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we're generating that HTML and having it
replaced. Now there also is a bit of a

00:09:05.050 --> 00:09:08.510 line:100% position:50% align:middle
problem now. If I were to backspace, it's
not finding anything,

00:09:08.510 --> 00:09:12.700 line:100% position:50% align:middle
but it's not actually removing anything.
So what we want to do is at the top of

00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:16.360 line:100% position:50% align:middle
this, where we did
"searchResults.style.display = 'block';",

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:22.800 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we could do "searchResults[removed] =
'';". And that will blow it away if there

00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:27.460 line:100% position:50% align:middle
is nothing to actually show. So here we
go, C-O-F-F-E-E. There we go.

00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:30.920 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And then if I were to remove the extra E,
it's not finding anything,

00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:35.750 line:100% position:50% align:middle
so it's going to remove it entirely for
us. Good. Last thing we need to do here is

00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:42.230 line:100% position:50% align:middle
a catch, the error. And if there is an
error, you need to handle it accordingly.

00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:45.690 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So it's up to you what you want
to do with that specific error.

00:09:45.690 --> 00:09:50.090 line:100% position:50% align:middle
You can just console.error the actually
error and send it off to yourself.

00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:54.620 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Or if you have something like Sentry set
up, the error will go off to your Sentry

00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:58.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
support. Good. So let's try it one more
time, make sure it's working.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.220 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Very good. Now there's a couple other
things that we need in order to actually

00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:06.470 line:100% position:50% align:middle
handle the changing over to it. Because I
can search for coffee and I can manually

00:10:06.470 --> 00:10:10.790 line:100% position:50% align:middle
click on one of them, and that's going to
bring me to that specific store.

00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:14.970 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Good, let's try it one more time. If I
search C-O-F-F-E-E, we see all of them.

00:10:14.970 --> 00:10:18.350 line:100% position:50% align:middle
If I were to click on one of them, like
Mulberry Coffee, we should go to the...

00:10:18.350 --> 00:10:22.970 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We don't go to the store. I think that's
because I screwed up the URL,

00:10:22.970 --> 00:10:28.510 line:100% position:50% align:middle
singular S. Singular stores, not multiple
stores. So let's try that once more.

00:10:28.510 --> 00:10:33.290 line:100% position:50% align:middle
C-O-F-F-E-E, click on Rust City Brewery,
and it actually brings me to the page

00:10:33.290 --> 00:10:39.020 line:100% position:50% align:middle
specifically for Rust City Brewery. Search
for it again, search for Donut Monster,

00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:41.360 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and it will get me to that page. Good. So
I can click on them,

00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:47.650 line:100% position:50% align:middle
but how do I also use my keys in order to
have a nice keyboard shortcut so I can use

00:10:47.650 --> 00:10:52.650 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the up and down? Well, let's go. We're
still inside of our main typeAhead

00:10:52.650 --> 00:11:00.070 line:100% position:50% align:middle
function right here. We'll say "handle
keyboard inputs". So,

00:11:00.070 --> 00:11:06.510 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"searchInput.on('keyup'". And when that
happens, we're going to take the event,

00:11:06.510 --> 00:11:10.830 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and let's just console.log the event,
.keyCode. And that should tell us which

00:11:10.830 --> 00:11:18.840 line:100% position:50% align:middle
keyCode we are pressing. So we search for
C-O-F-F-E-E. And then down,

00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:26.350 line:100% position:50% align:middle
down, down is 40. Up, up, up is 38. And
"enter" is 13. So really all we care about

00:11:26.350 --> 00:11:35.520 line:100% position:50% align:middle
is 38, 40, and 13. So what we can do here
is we'll say, "If they aren't pressing up,

00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:43.920 line:100% position:50% align:middle
down, or 'enter', who cares?" And we'll
skip it. It's like, "If the array",

00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:48.790 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and this is kind of a cool way to do it.
We'll say we're looking for 38,

00:11:48.790 --> 00:11:56.420 line:100% position:50% align:middle
40, or 13. If that doesn't include the
event .keyCode, then we'll simply just

00:11:56.420 --> 00:12:03.170 line:100% position:50% align:middle
return, "nah". Otherwise we're going to
console.log "DO SOMETHING!!".

00:12:03.170 --> 00:12:10.150 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So if we do not have 38, 40, or 13, then
just skip this one. We'll say skip it.

00:12:10.150 --> 00:12:14.520 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Otherwise we're going to console.log "DO
SOMETHING!!". So let's try it again now.

00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:19.080 line:100% position:50% align:middle
C-O-F-F-E-E, nothing. But I hit down, "Do
SOMETHING!!" Up, "DO SOMETHING!!" And I

00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:23.690 line:100% position:50% align:middle
hit "enter", a third "DO SOMETHING!!"
Good. Otherwise all the other keys are

00:12:23.690 --> 00:12:28.480 line:100% position:50% align:middle
doing absolutely nothing for us so we
don't really care. It becomes a little bit

00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:32.740 line:100% position:50% align:middle
of a complicated part because if we go to
the answer here, and I'm searching for

00:12:32.740 --> 00:12:37.620 line:100% position:50% align:middle
coffee, you notice I can hit down and up.
And if I hit the bottom and I hit down,

00:12:37.620 --> 00:12:42.570 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it will cycle to the top. If I hit up on
the first one, it will cycle to the last

00:12:42.570 --> 00:12:48.180 line:100% position:50% align:middle
one. And it will allow you just to sort of
move your selected cursor throughout all

00:12:48.180 --> 00:12:52.050 line:100% position:50% align:middle
of them. So if you want a little bit of a
challenge, pause and try to come up with

00:12:52.050 --> 00:12:56.890 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the actual JavaScript, front-end
JavaScript, to handle this. Otherwise I'll

00:12:56.890 --> 00:13:01.890 line:100% position:50% align:middle
go through it now with you. So the first
thing that we need is an active class that

00:13:01.890 --> 00:13:06.350 line:100% position:50% align:middle
is going to mark each one as active,
right? If I were to inspect this sucker

00:13:06.350 --> 00:13:11.710 line:100% position:50% align:middle
here and I were to move up and down, you
see how I'm removing and adding the class

00:13:11.710 --> 00:13:17.040 line:100% position:50% align:middle
of search__result--active? I'm just going
to keep that, search__result--active,

00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:21.202 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I'm going to keep that in a variable here.
So we'll go here and we'll say,

00:13:21.202 --> 00:13:32.940 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"const activeClass =". And that is going
to be search__result--active.

00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:36.840 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Then we need the current. Every single
time that we press down,

00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:41.320 line:100% position:50% align:middle
what we're going to be doing is we're
going to be finding the current one.

00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:44.520 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And the way that we're going to do that is
we're just going to find which one has

00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:51.380 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that current class. So we'll say, "const
current = search.querySelector".

00:13:51.380 --> 00:13:56.230 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And we're going to be looking for
something with the class, actually we need

00:13:56.230 --> 00:14:00.950 line:100% position:50% align:middle
backticks here, something with the class
of activeClass. And the only reason I'm

00:14:00.950 --> 00:14:04.010 line:100% position:50% align:middle
putting it in a variable here is because I
don't feel like writing this thing over

00:14:04.010 --> 00:14:07.500 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and over again. I'd rather just put it in
a variable and reference the variable

00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:11.740 line:100% position:50% align:middle
activeClass over and over. Then we will
take a list of all of the items.

00:14:11.740 --> 00:14:18.300 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So, "const items =
search.querySelectorAll", because we want

00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:22.930 line:100% position:50% align:middle
a node list to come back. We're going to
look for all the search results,

00:14:22.930 --> 00:14:27.370 line:100% position:50% align:middle
search__results. Then finally we need a
let variable called next.

00:14:27.370 --> 00:14:30.290 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And the reason that is a let and not a
const is because we are going to be

00:14:30.290 --> 00:14:33.840 line:100% position:50% align:middle
updating it. Essentially how it's going to
work is that we're going to figure out

00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:40.140 line:100% position:50% align:middle
what are we currently on and, if someone
presses down or up, which one is going to

00:14:40.140 --> 00:14:46.200 line:100% position:50% align:middle
be the next one. So first thing we want to
do is say, "If they press down and there

00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:53.550 line:100% position:50% align:middle
is one selected, we want to set next to be
the one after it." So if I'm on Mulberry

00:14:53.550 --> 00:14:57.870 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and I press down, I want the next one to
be Rest City Brewery.

00:14:57.870 --> 00:15:05.170 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So say, "If the event .keyCode is equal to
40," meaning that they press down,

00:15:05.170 --> 00:15:11.140 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"and there is a current one already,"
because they've already selected one,

00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:18.190 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"then the next one is going to be the
current one, .nextElementSibling,

00:15:18.190 --> 00:15:23.070 line:100% position:50% align:middle
or this is going to be the first one in
the actual row." And what that will do is

00:15:23.070 --> 00:15:29.130 line:100% position:50% align:middle
if I'm on the last one, there's obviously
no nextElementSibling because I'm on the

00:15:29.130 --> 00:15:34.600 line:100% position:50% align:middle
last one. And what this "or" will do is it
will fall back to the first item in our

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:44.980 line:100% position:50% align:middle
array. Then we have an "else if (e.keyCode
=== 40)", then what we say is "next =

00:15:44.980 --> 00:15:51.620 line:100% position:50% align:middle
items0". So if they press down and there
is no current, so it's the first time.

00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:57.050 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Let me refresh this page. I hit "coffee"
and there's current one because I haven't

00:15:57.050 --> 00:16:02.840 line:100% position:50% align:middle
selected any yet, and I press down. Now in
that case the keyCode was down,

00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:08.980 line:100% position:50% align:middle
so the next one has to be the first one so
far. Next up we have else if the event

00:16:08.980 --> 00:16:17.230 line:100% position:50% align:middle
.keyCode is equal to 38 and there is a
current, so this is kind of the opposite.

00:16:17.230 --> 00:16:24.710 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So if someone is pressing, what did we say
the up was? Keycode.info.

00:16:24.710 --> 00:16:30.780 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So if someone is pressing up, which is 38.
Down, which is 40. And there is a current

00:16:30.780 --> 00:16:39.500 line:100% position:50% align:middle
one. We'll say next is equal to the
current.previousElementSibling or the last

00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:46.550 line:100% position:50% align:middle
thing in the items. So here if I'm
"coffee" and I press up, then it should

00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:53.890 line:100% position:50% align:middle
select the last one. So we'll say
items.length-1, square bracket

00:16:53.890 --> 00:16:58.450 line:100% position:50% align:middle
items.length-1. And that's a little trick
that we can use to get the last element on

00:16:58.450 --> 00:17:03.300 line:100% position:50% align:middle
there. Then we say, "Else if the event
.keyCode is equal to 38,

00:17:03.300 --> 00:17:09.420 line:100% position:50% align:middle
so if it's just equal to 38, the next is
going to be equal to the items,

00:17:09.420 --> 00:17:17.730 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the last one in the list, items.length-1.
Finally, we need to handle the "enter"

00:17:17.730 --> 00:17:25.540 line:100% position:50% align:middle
key. So we'll say, "Else if the e.keyCode
is equal to 13 and there is a

00:17:25.540 --> 00:17:31.950 line:100% position:50% align:middle
current.href". Meaning that if someone hit
"enter" and there is a current element

00:17:31.950 --> 00:17:36.750 line:100% position:50% align:middle
with a href value on it, then we need to
put them on that actual page.

00:17:36.750 --> 00:17:45.370 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So say, "[removed] = current.href;".
So at this point let's just console.log

00:17:45.370 --> 00:17:51.080 line:100% position:50% align:middle
next and see what we're dealing with after
this huge if/if else statement.

00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:56.360 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I'm going to refresh here and type in
"coffee", and open up my dev tools now.

00:17:56.360 --> 00:18:01.520 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And I'm going to press down, down, down,
down. It's always undefined,

00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:07.890 line:100% position:50% align:middle
so we have a bit of an error here. Let's
double-check. Oh, "next = items0".

00:18:07.890 --> 00:18:13.520 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And give that a refresh. "Coffee", down,
there we go. I push down,

00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:17.690 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Mulberry Coffee. Press down again, it's
always going to give me Mulberry Coffee

00:18:17.690 --> 00:18:21.170 line:100% position:50% align:middle
because we're not adding the class. So
down, down, down. If I hit up,

00:18:21.170 --> 00:18:24.500 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it's going to give me Donut Monster
because that's the last one in there.

00:18:24.500 --> 00:18:28.760 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Good. So what we want to do now that we
have next, we want to add an activeClass

00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:31.780 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to our next one. So in the
next.classList.add, the activeClass.

00:18:31.780 --> 00:18:41.790 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I'll see what we're doing here. So
"coffee", down, Mulberry. Down,

00:18:41.790 --> 00:18:47.090 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Rust City. Down, oh, we're kind of stuck
here. We have two, and now all three have

00:18:47.090 --> 00:18:52.240 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the class of active. Well, before we add a
class of active to that next one we need

00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:58.920 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to remove it from the current one. So say,
"If there is a current one,

00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:05.140 line:100% position:50% align:middle
then we will simply take the current and
take the class list and we will remove the

00:19:05.140 --> 00:19:12.320 line:100% position:50% align:middle
activeClass. So if we currently have a
current one, then just remove it from it.

00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:16.400 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"Coffee", down, there we go. Down, down,
up, up, up, down, down,

00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:20.880 line:100% position:50% align:middle
down. Good, it seems to be cycling just
fine. Now if I hit "enter" on Rust City

00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:26.930 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Brewery, oh, "Cannot read property
'classList' of undefined". Oh,

00:19:26.930 --> 00:19:31.170 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and that's because if you do hit "enter",
we need to stop this function from

00:19:31.170 --> 00:19:36.730 line:100% position:50% align:middle
running. So we type a return. So we'll say
"coffee". Down, down,

00:19:36.730 --> 00:19:42.830 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Rust City Brewery, I'm going to hit
"enter". Doesn't seem to have worked.

00:19:42.830 --> 00:19:47.770 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Let's do a quick console.log in here and
debug it, "Changing Pages!" And

00:19:47.770 --> 00:19:52.430 line:100% position:50% align:middle
console.log current, see what that does.
"Coffee", enter. It says "Changing

00:19:52.430 --> 00:19:57.230 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Pages!", it gives us the current Rust City
Brewery. Oh, what am I doing with these

00:19:57.230 --> 00:20:01.210 line:100% position:50% align:middle
triple equals? It's only one equals.
You're probably yelling at me being like,

00:20:01.210 --> 00:20:04.890 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"What a fool. How does this guy have a
course? He doesn't even know how equals

00:20:04.890 --> 00:20:09.220 line:100% position:50% align:middle
works." Hit "enter". There we go, then it
will actually change the page because you

00:20:09.220 --> 00:20:12.300 line:100% position:50% align:middle
have to know how JavaScript works before
we get into that. So delete those two

00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:16.780 line:100% position:50% align:middle
console.logs, now we have all of this
stuff working beautifully for us.

00:20:16.780 --> 00:20:20.180 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I know that's quite a bit of code, but
it's kind of neat to take a break from the

00:20:20.180 --> 00:20:24.510 line:100% position:50% align:middle
server-side stuff and just work with a
little bit more of this interfacy stuff

00:20:24.510 --> 00:20:29.160 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that requires us to have keyboard input as
well as clicking. So that us our layout

00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:32.950 line:100% position:50% align:middle
there. One thing I did notice is that I
used a traditional require here,

00:20:32.950 --> 00:20:36.820 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and everywhere else through our front-end
JavaScript we use our ES6 import.

00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:41.210 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And the reason why that still worked is
because we're using webpack to convert to

00:20:41.210 --> 00:20:46.890 line:100% position:50% align:middle
CommonJS first, and then it gets compiled
for us. So instead of requiring axios,

00:20:46.890 --> 00:20:54.990 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we want to say "import axios from
'axios';". And then that will do exactly

00:20:54.990 --> 00:20:59.640 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the same thing, but we're just keeping it
consistent with ES6 on our front end.

00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:03.560 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And then on the server side we're still
using CommonJS modules just because we do

00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:08.320 line:100% position:50% align:middle
not have ES6 modules in Node just yet. You
can compile them, but it's more of a

00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:12.310 line:100% position:50% align:middle
headache than it's worth because it's just
syntax at the end of the day.

00:21:12.310 --> 00:21:17.090 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we've got this up and running, let's
double-check that this works.

00:21:17.090 --> 00:21:22.380 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"Coffee", there we go. One other thing is
that on the answer when you don't find

00:21:22.380 --> 00:21:26.400 line:100% position:50% align:middle
something, it tells you "No Results for,"
the word, "Found". And that's probably

00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:30.540 line:100% position:50% align:middle
better than what we're doing, which is
just hiding it. Because then your user is

00:21:30.540 --> 00:21:37.960 line:100% position:50% align:middle
trying to do stuff and nothing is
happening, right? So what did we do?

00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:43.550 line:100% position:50% align:middle
If there's no value, quit it. But at this
point we say, "If there is some stuff that

00:21:43.550 --> 00:21:46.960 line:100% position:50% align:middle
comes back". And at this point right here
what we want to do is,

00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:53.580 line:100% position:50% align:middle
rather than clear out the innerHTML, what
we want to do is we will have an else

00:21:53.580 --> 00:21:58.940 line:100% position:50% align:middle
here. Or we will just return from this and
not have an else, just on its own line

00:21:58.940 --> 00:22:04.910 line:100% position:50% align:middle
here. And we'll say, "Tell them nothing
came back". Which means that the result

00:22:04.910 --> 00:22:09.070 line:100% position:50% align:middle
data came back, but there wasn't length to
it because there were no results.

00:22:09.070 --> 00:22:15.260 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So at that point what we'll do is we'll
take our searchResults[removed] and we'll

00:22:15.260 --> 00:22:21.730 line:100% position:50% align:middle
set it to use some backticks. We will take
a div with a class of search__result,

00:22:21.730 --> 00:22:26.100 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and then inside of that we'll say "No
results for," and we can interpolate the

00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:32.430 line:100% position:50% align:middle
value, ${this.value}, "found!" We'll see
if that works. There we go,

00:22:32.430 --> 00:22:36.800 line:100% position:50% align:middle
no results found. It will tell us exactly
what it has found. And then if we

00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:38.920 line:100% position:50% align:middle
backspace, it will go away. Good. So those
are a couple things.

00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:44.580 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And the last thing, I think that we're
open to an XSS attack, a cross-site

00:22:44.580 --> 00:22:49.950 line:100% position:50% align:middle
scripting attack, right here. And the way
that we can test that is if we are to log

00:22:49.950 --> 00:22:54.110 line:100% position:50% align:middle
in real quick and we are to go to one of
the stores that we had made with this

00:22:54.110 --> 00:22:58.370 line:100% position:50% align:middle
account. And in this case New Store is the
only one I've done.

00:22:58.370 --> 00:23:04.230 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And let's change the New Store to be an
image tag. And the image tag can go to

00:23:04.230 --> 00:23:09.250 line:100% position:50% align:middle
anything, I'm just going to copy this
image. It doesn't matter what it's to,

00:23:09.250 --> 00:23:12.750 line:100% position:50% align:middle
what's important is that there is an
onload event with an image.

00:23:12.750 --> 00:23:21.770 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And you can say, "alert&amp;#40;'you got
hacked'&amp;#41;". So let's see if this works.

00:23:21.770 --> 00:23:28.520 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Save. So you see, that immediately pops up
because what we just did is we allowed

00:23:28.520 --> 00:23:34.380 line:100% position:50% align:middle
somebody to put an image tag inside of
their store name. Which in most cases Pug

00:23:34.380 --> 00:23:38.970 line:100% position:50% align:middle
will take care of it for you. So let's
look for New Store. See,

00:23:38.970 --> 00:23:43.040 line:100% position:50% align:middle
somebody can try and put an image and it
won't actually load it.

00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:48.240 line:100% position:50% align:middle
But when we are responsible for creating
HTML ourselves, as we have done in our

00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:52.740 line:100% position:50% align:middle
search results right here, if I search for
"New", look at this.

00:23:52.740 --> 00:23:56.680 line:100% position:50% align:middle
As soon as I search for "New" it says "you
got hacked", I press "OK",

00:23:56.680 --> 00:24:02.900 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and it actually brings the result with
allowing us to have a store with a strong,

00:24:02.900 --> 00:24:07.220 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and then the image tag is in here. We're
taking advantage of the onload event in

00:24:07.220 --> 00:24:11.720 line:100% position:50% align:middle
JavaScript. And at that point anyone could
load any JavaScript they could possibly

00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:15.890 line:100% position:50% align:middle
want and actually ruin your website. So
you need to be really careful.

00:24:15.890 --> 00:24:21.180 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Before you actually embed any HTML on your
page, you need to sanitize that data.

00:24:21.180 --> 00:24:26.350 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And if you have looked at my ES6 course, I
like to do this with a library called

00:24:26.350 --> 00:24:37.210 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Purify. Go to the top here and we will
"import dompurify from 'dompurify';".

00:24:37.210 --> 00:24:41.690 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now we have this thing called dompurify.
And then anywhere you are setting HTML,

00:24:41.690 --> 00:24:46.080 line:100% position:50% align:middle
so we are doing it right here,
searchResults, we'll just wrap the entire

00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:54.310 line:100% position:50% align:middle
searchResults in dompurify.sanitize. And
then also we're doing it right here.

00:24:54.310 --> 00:24:57.550 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Technically someone could access this
themselves by searching for something,

00:24:57.550 --> 00:25:01.920 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and then it would set the innerHTML. We
don't want that. So we'll

00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:06.860 line:100% position:50% align:middle
dompurify.sanitize that. Save. Now when we
refresh and you search for "New",

00:25:06.860 --> 00:25:12.340 line:100% position:50% align:middle
what that does is it still finds that huge
image, but you can see that the onload

00:25:12.340 --> 00:25:17.670 line:100% position:50% align:middle
event has been stripped out of the actual
image that was in the URL.

00:25:17.670 --> 00:25:22.230 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So what you could also do at this point is
use other libraries to strip out images.

00:25:22.230 --> 00:25:26.410 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Or, even better, when somebody actually
saves the data to your database,

00:25:26.410 --> 00:25:30.370 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you could strip out the images, as well.
How you would do that is you would go into

00:25:30.370 --> 00:25:35.110 line:100% position:50% align:middle
your store model, Store.js, and you would
add yourself another "Scheme.pre('save'".

00:25:35.110 --> 00:25:39.460 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And this one we did for the slug, but then
you could get another Node.js library that

00:25:39.460 --> 00:25:45.050 line:100% position:50% align:middle
will strip any unnecessary HTML or any
HTML from specific fields.

00:25:45.050 --> 00:25:49.810 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So maybe you do want some HTML to be
available in the description,

00:25:49.810 --> 00:25:53.960 line:100% position:50% align:middle
but absolutely no HTML to be available in
the title. Then you would add yourself a

00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:56.300 line:100% position:50% align:middle
new "pre('save'". So I'm not going to show
you how to do that,

00:25:56.300 --> 00:26:00.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
but if you want to have a little bit of a
challenge to go into something right now,

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:04.140 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I definitely challenge you to actually
implement that. Throw it up on GitHub and

00:26:04.140 --> 00:26:06.690 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I'm sure other people in the course would
love to see how you finished that.

00:26:06.690 --> 00:26:11.080 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So that is our search results, let's move
on to doing some more stuff with the AJAX

00:26:11.080 --> 00:26:12.309 line:100% position:50% align:middle
endpoints.
