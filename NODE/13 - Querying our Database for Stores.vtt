00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.320 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Let's get to actually displaying our
stores. Now that we've added two or three

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.920 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to our database, we need to show them on
the actual page. Now,

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:22.170 line:100% position:50% align:middle
where is that going to happen? It's going
to happen first on the homepage.

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.400 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Second, it's also going to show when you
visit your store's page directly.

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.930 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we need a controller method that's
going to run on both of those routes.

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:38.940 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We'll do that right now. We'll say,
"exports.getStores =". That's going to be

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:44.370 line:100% position:50% align:middle
a request, and then I have a response.
Then, inside of that let's just say,

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:50.290 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"res.render". We're going to render out
the "stores" URL and the title of that is

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:56.490 line:100% position:50% align:middle
going to be "Stores". So let's try that
out. We go back to our routes,

00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:02.740 line:100% position:50% align:middle
index.js, and we'll say "router.get" is no
longer going to be our homepage.

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:06.650 line:100% position:50% align:middle
It's now going to be "getStores." So you
see the beauty of this.

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:10.740 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Then, it would just duplicate that line.
We'll just hit CMD+SHIFT+E,

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.580 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and you want to say anytime you visit the
"stores", you also want to run that.

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.930 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So give that a save. If we refresh that,
it should tell us it doesn't find the

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:25.440 line:100% position:50% align:middle
template. There we go, cannot find it. So
let's go and open up our views and make a

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:34.700 line:100% position:50% align:middle
new file called "stores.pug". Again, you
can take this over if you want to go to

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.660 line:100% position:50% align:middle
something like editStore if you just want
to take that and paste it in here.

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:44.040 line:100% position:50% align:middle
It extends the layout. We don't need the
store form there. You have a "block

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:51.330 line:100% position:50% align:middle
content" h2 title, and take the store form
out. So let's go through that real quick.

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:56.480 line:100% position:50% align:middle
When somebody hits our route, which is
either "/" or "/stores",

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:01.200 line:100% position:50% align:middle
use the controller method, getStores, for
both of them, which is "getStores".

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.580 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Then, that will immediately render out the
"stores" URL with just a title called

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:12.190 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"Stores". We'll see if that works. There
we go. "Stores" on the homepage.

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.120 line:100% position:50% align:middle
That works as well on the Stores page.
Both of those pages are working.

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:22.420 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Good. Now, that's not all. What we need to
do here is before we get the stores,

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:31.900 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we need to first query the database for a
list of all stores before we can actually

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:37.750 line:100% position:50% align:middle
show them on the page. So the way that we
do that is very similar to how we saved a

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.700 line:100% position:50% align:middle
store in the last couple videos. But now,
we're going to be querying the database

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.400 line:100% position:50% align:middle
for a list of our new stores. So the first
thing we need to do is make this an async

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:51.760 line:100% position:50% align:middle
function. When you have an async function,
you must go back to your routes and find

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:58.570 line:100% position:50% align:middle
your Store controller, and wrap it in
catchErrors, because we're going to be

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:04.400 line:100% position:50% align:middle
using our async/await without any
try-catch here. Good. Go back here,

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:10.870 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and we will take our store and we will use
".find". What ".find" will do is it will

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:14.790 line:100% position:50% align:middle
query the database for all of them. Now,
there's a whole bunch of different things

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:20.140 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we can chain on here to limit and search
for ones that only contain a specific word

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:23.730 line:100% position:50% align:middle
in the title. We're going to get into more
queries. But for now,

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.180 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we're just going to find them all, and
then later we'll come back and do

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:30.550 line:100% position:50% align:middle
patching and things like that. So
"Store.find", and how do save that in a

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:35.980 line:100% position:50% align:middle
database? Well, we simply say, "const
stores = Store.find". "Store.find" is

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:41.510 line:100% position:50% align:middle
going to return a promise. So how do we
wait for "Store.find" to come back before

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:46.170 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we actually send data to the user and
render it out? Well, you await it,

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:50.850 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"await Store.find", and then on the next
line you should be able to console.log all

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:55.590 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the stores. So let's give that a save. I'm
going to open up my terminal here,

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:00.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
clear it out, refresh. Whoa. You see that
it still loads "stores",

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:06.910 line:100% position:50% align:middle
but our "console.log" here has
console.logged an array of every single

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:12.100 line:100% position:50% align:middle
store that is available to us. So we now
want to take that "stores" variable and

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:16.380 line:100% position:50% align:middle
give it to our actually template, so we
can loop over it. The way that we do that

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:20.260 line:100% position:50% align:middle
is you simply just pass it the "stores"
property, and we're going to pass it the

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:24.390 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"stores" variable. Or if you've taken my
ES6 course, you'll know I've got a little

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:29.570 line:100% position:50% align:middle
red underline there. If the property name
is the same as the variable that you are

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:33.450 line:100% position:50% align:middle
passing along, so property name is
"stores", the variable that we're passing

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:37.510 line:100% position:50% align:middle
along is also "stores", you can simply
just pass the variable.

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:42.630 line:100% position:50% align:middle
That will do the same thing as we're doing
there. So if we go back in,

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:48.390 line:100% position:50% align:middle
nothing will change. But we can go into
our stores, and maybe do a "pre= h.",

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:54.540 line:100% position:50% align:middle
take a dump, sorry, and try to dump our
stores onto the page. What do we got

00:04:54.540 --> 00:05:00.810 line:100% position:50% align:middle
there? Hey. So if you dump your "stores"
variable, you'll see that before we render

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:05.600 line:100% position:50% align:middle
out this page, we quickly hit the database
for an array of all of our stores.

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:09.460 line:100% position:50% align:middle
You see the Bakery, the Fish Market, the
test, and Testing 123.

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:14.930 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Those are the four that if you go back to
your database here and give it a refresh,

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:20.020 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you'll see one, two, three, four. Those
are all of our stores that we have.

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:24.590 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Good. Now, how do we loop over all of
that? How do we actually get them

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:29.310 line:100% position:50% align:middle
displaying? Well, let's look at that now.
Take out that dump and we're going to give

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:32.640 line:100% position:50% align:middle
ourselves a div with a class of "stores",
and then we're going to loop over with

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:40.030 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"each store in stores". For each one,
let's just try to give ourselves an h2

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:45.090 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"store.name". What's that give us? Here we
go, Bakery, Fish Market,

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:51.430 line:100% position:50% align:middle
test, Testing 123. Good. But what we
actually want to do is to shell off this

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:56.470 line:100% position:50% align:middle
displaying of each individual stores to a
separate mixin, and I'm going to call that

00:05:56.470 --> 00:06:02.760 line:100% position:50% align:middle
a "storeCard". We'll go back into our
views, mixins, New File.

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:12.230 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We'll call it "_storeCard.pug", and we'll
make a mixin called "mixin storeCard".

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:18.650 line:100% position:50% align:middle
It takes in a "store" that will default to
being blank. Then, we will have inside of

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:24.300 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that a store which has a ".store__hero".
Inside of that, we're going to have the

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:32.700 line:100% position:50% align:middle
image tag with a source that is equal to
backticks, and that is either going to be

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:38.650 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"/uploads/". We're going to try to see if
the store has a photo.

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:42.060 line:100% position:50% align:middle
You'll know now it doesn't have a photo,
because we haven't done that part yet.

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:45.260 line:100% position:50% align:middle
But if it doesn't have a store photo,
we're simply just going to give it

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:50.640 line:100% position:50% align:middle
store.png, and that will fall back to
something that I've got in this.

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:56.190 line:100% position:50% align:middle
If we go to public, uploads, you'll see
this store.png. This is what we're going

00:06:56.190 --> 00:07:01.280 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to fall back to if it does not exist.
Store.png, and then also what do we want

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:07.380 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to put in there? We want to have an h2
with a class of "title" and we have a link

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:11.760 line:100% position:50% align:middle
in there that's going to link to
"a(href=". Now, we need to generate this

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:19.930 line:100% position:50% align:middle
URL. So it's going to be backticks
"/store/${store.slug}", because the store

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:24.610 line:100% position:50% align:middle
is going to have a slug. Then, inside of
that, we can use "store.name".

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:31.520 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now, again, let me remind you of how silly
this is. If you want to generate an

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:37.960 line:100% position:50% align:middle
attribute like this, you have to use
backticks and the ES6 ${}.

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:42.400 line:100% position:50% align:middle
If you want to put a variable inside of
the text content of a node,

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:46.460 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you have to use the hash properties.
That's a little bit weird that you have to

00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:50.460 line:100% position:50% align:middle
know both of those, but you'll get used to
it pretty quickly. So we just made this

00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:54.450 line:100% position:50% align:middle
mixin here called "storeCard". If we go
back to our stores here,

00:07:54.450 --> 00:08:01.210 line:100% position:50% align:middle
can we import it really quickly? Yes, we
can. We'll say, "include mixins".

00:08:01.210 --> 00:08:04.850 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Notice how there's no quotes around here,
"storeCard", because that's the name of

00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:09.790 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the file. Then, here, instead of having an
h2, we're going to delete that and you

00:08:09.790 --> 00:08:14.650 line:100% position:50% align:middle
just use our storeCard, which you pass it
all the data it needs,

00:08:14.650 --> 00:08:18.880 line:100% position:50% align:middle
which is our "store" variable. So woo,
let's see if that works.

00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:24.590 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Cross your fingers. Beautiful. We've got
our Baker, our test, Fish Market,

00:08:24.590 --> 00:08:28.140 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and you can click on one of them. It
should actually bring you to the URL.

00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:33.280 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Obviously, it's still 404. We don't have
that page. But we are now listing out all

00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:35.550 line:100% position:50% align:middle
of the stores. Now, we can take that a
little bit further out.

00:08:35.550 --> 00:08:39.520 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Say, we haven't put everything into it. So
let's go back to our storeCard here.

00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:44.600 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now, down here, we have our
"store__details". That's just the CSS

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:47.300 line:100% position:50% align:middle
class. So again, we're going to have a
"hero", and we're going to have a

00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:50.790 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"details" as a sibling that. Inside of
that, we'll have a paragraph tag,

00:08:50.790 --> 00:08:55.510 line:100% position:50% align:middle
which will include the "store.description"
property. Now, if I refresh that,

00:08:55.510 --> 00:08:59.660 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you'll see that our descriptions are now
popping up inside of our store details

00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:04.050 line:100% position:50% align:middle
divs. They're all properly spaced like
that. One thing that could possibly happen

00:09:04.050 --> 00:09:10.780 line:100% position:50% align:middle
is somebody could add a really long store.
So here I can say, "Really Long Store

00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:17.950 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Name". We get a whole bunch of "lorem
ipsum" here. Someone could add a really

00:09:17.950 --> 00:09:22.890 line:100% position:50% align:middle
long description in here and save. I
successfully created it, go back to my

00:09:22.890 --> 00:09:28.160 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Stores page. Now, we've got a bit of a
problem with this really long description

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:34.820 line:100% position:50% align:middle
here. So what we could do is say like,
maximum 25 words in our template when

00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:38.560 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you're viewing a storeCard. That's pretty
good. We can just take description,

00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:44.150 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and because Pug is just JavaScript, you
can immediately split it on a space.

00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:49.710 line:100% position:50% align:middle
You can then take that array that it
returns and slice it for the first 25

00:09:49.710 --> 00:09:57.370 line:100% position:50% align:middle
words. Then, you can join it back together
with a space. That will cut it down to...

00:09:57.370 --> 00:10:02.620 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Oh, no. All right. Let's see what we've
got here. "Unexpected token." Oh,

00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:06.410 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you can't do semicolons in Pug. Because
while it is JavaScript,

00:10:06.410 --> 00:10:12.270 line:100% position:50% align:middle
there are no semicolons in Pug. There we
go. What that did is it trimmed it to 25

00:10:12.270 --> 00:10:19.360 line:100% position:50% align:middle
words. What happened there? Well, let's
say we have that string here.

00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:24.450 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So I'll say, "const string" or maybe
"words =" and we'll put it in a string.

00:10:24.450 --> 00:10:31.070 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So I have our words. If you've split
something on a space, that will give you

00:10:31.070 --> 00:10:36.190 line:100% position:50% align:middle
an array of all of the words. Here, we
have 50 words. So immediately,

00:10:36.190 --> 00:10:42.170 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you can take that array and you can slice
it, getting the first to the 25th word,

00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:49.110 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and that returns us an array with a length
of 25 words. Then, we're going to turn

00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:54.950 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that array right back into a sentence,
with join with a space again,

00:10:54.950 --> 00:11:00.960 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and that's a nice quick way to slice a
sentence without slicing it in the middle

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:06.450 line:100% position:50% align:middle
of any of your possible words. So you'll
do that quite a bit, where you do have the

00:11:06.450 --> 00:11:11.160 line:100% position:50% align:middle
data, but you just need to massage it in a
little bit. It's totally fine just to do a

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:16.420 line:100% position:50% align:middle
little bit of work inside of your template
when you rather not do it inside of your

00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:21.630 line:100% position:50% align:middle
controller. So we've got our store details
showing up. Everything is starting to look

00:11:21.630 --> 00:11:24.790 line:100% position:50% align:middle
pretty good. One last thing is it's
looking a little bit squished here,

00:11:24.790 --> 00:11:27.890 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and that's because we haven't added the
store actions just yet,

00:11:27.890 --> 00:11:31.990 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and that's going to allow us to heart and
favorite, and remove all of those things.

00:11:31.990 --> 00:11:36.070 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So what we want to do here is just go
inside of your "hero". The first line,

00:11:36.070 --> 00:11:42.130 line:100% position:50% align:middle
give yourself a "store__actions" and
inside of that you can just give yourself

00:11:42.130 --> 00:11:49.550 line:100% position:50% align:middle
a button that says "Soon". Then, what that
will do is it'll put us a little button

00:11:49.550 --> 00:11:52.600 line:100% position:50% align:middle
there. Eventually, we're going to come
back and change that out and that'll kick

00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:59.060 line:100% position:50% align:middle
in the CSS, so things start to look a lot
better. So that is looping over all of our

00:11:59.060 --> 00:12:04.270 line:100% position:50% align:middle
data. Again, let's review that real quick.
We have a route which calls our getStores

00:12:04.270 --> 00:12:09.300 line:100% position:50% align:middle
controller. Our Stores controller is
responsible for two things.

00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:16.390 line:100% position:50% align:middle
It's going to get the data, and then it's
going to pass the data to our template,

00:12:16.390 --> 00:12:22.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
which will then in turn be used in a mixin
and a template, to loop over and explain

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.490 line:100% position:50% align:middle
all of that data. You can take those
console.logs out. It sort of muddies up

00:12:25.490 --> 00:12:30.640 line:100% position:50% align:middle
your actual terminal window. Refresh.
Good. We're in good shape.

00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:32.272 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I'll see you in the next one.

00:12:32.272 --> 00:12:34.272 line:100% position:50% align:middle
