00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:04.664
<v Wes>In my JavaScript 30 course</v>

3
00:00:04.664 --> 00:00:06.306
we did something called a ray cardio,

4
00:00:06.306 --> 00:00:07.207
and I remember everyone loved it

5
00:00:07.207 --> 00:00:09.758
because it's a great way to just get a lot of practice in.

6
00:00:09.758 --> 00:00:11.943
And we've got a lot of real world practice

7
00:00:11.943 --> 00:00:13.501
coming in in the second half of this course,

8
00:00:13.501 --> 00:00:15.144
but I feel like right now we need a

9
00:00:15.144 --> 00:00:16.734
little bit of practice in terms of making

10
00:00:16.734 --> 00:00:18.241
columns and rows and spanning it.

11
00:00:18.241 --> 00:00:20.698
Really I mean to show that we understand

12
00:00:20.698 --> 00:00:23.259
placing and sizing items on our grids.

13
00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:25.782
So open up, get sweaty-START,

14
00:00:25.782 --> 00:00:29.615
and I in10tionally have not done these myself.

15
00:00:31.724 --> 00:00:34.349
So I kinda of gonna do it along, as we do it.

16
00:00:34.349 --> 00:00:36.518
So first one is: "Make the grid 10 columns wide,

17
00:00:36.518 --> 00:00:39.855
"every other taking up twice the free space."

18
00:00:39.855 --> 00:00:42.692
so I should also say at this point, don't,

19
00:00:42.692 --> 00:00:46.046
if you haven't at least given this one a shot,

20
00:00:46.046 --> 00:00:49.350
then pause this video and try to do this yourself,

21
00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.896
but if you either aren't feeling comfortable with it

22
00:00:52.896 --> 00:00:54.649
or you've give it a shot and you want

23
00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:57.424
to see how I've done it, then let's go.

24
00:00:57.424 --> 00:00:58.859
So giddy up.

25
00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.759
First thing I want to do is grid,

26
00:01:01.759 --> 00:01:03.590
grod, grid template columns,

27
00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:06.613
and we're going to do repeat.

28
00:01:06.613 --> 00:01:09.440
We want five columns, or we want 10 columns,

29
00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.954
but every other one, so 1fr and 2fr,

30
00:01:12.954 --> 00:01:15.350
and that should give us a bunch.

31
00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:16.995
It's not, why?

32
00:01:16.995 --> 00:01:18.583
Oh, its 'cause I missed a comma.

33
00:01:18.583 --> 00:01:19.768
There we go, Okay good.

34
00:01:19.768 --> 00:01:21.501
So now we are seeing our one, two,

35
00:01:21.501 --> 00:01:24.558
three, four, all the way to 10 columns

36
00:01:24.558 --> 00:01:27.131
and every other one is taking up twice the amount of space.

37
00:01:27.131 --> 00:01:28.893
Good, I'm happy about that.

38
00:01:28.893 --> 00:01:33.648
"Make the grid have 10 explicit tows, 50 pixels high each.

39
00:01:33.648 --> 00:01:35.481
So grid template rows.

40
00:01:36.611 --> 00:01:39.350
We are going to repeat 10 rows,

41
00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:41.474
each on is going to be 50 pixels high.

42
00:01:41.474 --> 00:01:43.524
Good, and now that didn't really do much,

43
00:01:43.524 --> 00:01:45.646
but if we were to open up our dev tools,

44
00:01:45.646 --> 00:01:49.457
and we were to take a look at our actual gid,

45
00:01:49.457 --> 00:01:53.184
you'll see that the grid actually has all of this free space

46
00:01:53.184 --> 00:01:56.491
in which we could use place our different items in there.

47
00:01:56.491 --> 00:01:58.496
I'm actually going to leave my dev tools open.

48
00:01:58.496 --> 00:02:00.456
As we did it, good, now let's get into it.

49
00:02:00.456 --> 00:02:03.508
"With item one, start a column three and go until five."

50
00:02:03.508 --> 00:02:07.258
So item one, we are going to say grid-column.

51
00:02:09.247 --> 00:02:10.721
And we can say grid-column start

52
00:02:10.721 --> 00:02:12.758
or grid column end or do it all in one.

53
00:02:12.758 --> 00:02:16.581
So I want to start at three and go until five.

54
00:02:16.581 --> 00:02:17.414
Good.

55
00:02:18.254 --> 00:02:20.095
Then the next one: "With item two,

56
00:02:20.095 --> 00:02:22.764
"start at column five and go until the end."

57
00:02:22.764 --> 00:02:23.764
So item two.

58
00:02:25.825 --> 00:02:27.181
Grid-column.

59
00:02:27.181 --> 00:02:28.702
We want to start at five.

60
00:02:28.702 --> 00:02:29.809
So this may seem weird that,

61
00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:32.230
like you can end and start at the same,

62
00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.903
but remember that the numbers are the lines

63
00:02:34.903 --> 00:02:37.635
inbetween the columns and the rows

64
00:02:37.635 --> 00:02:41.642
not the actual columns and rows or tracks themselves.

65
00:02:41.642 --> 00:02:44.100
So start at five and then go until the end.

66
00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:48.866
Well I could say 11 and that would for sure work,

67
00:02:48.866 --> 00:02:52.866
but if we were to change this to being like six,

68
00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:56.424
than it wouldn't work anymore.

69
00:02:56.424 --> 00:02:58.346
So what I want to do is ensure that it

70
00:02:58.346 --> 00:02:59.857
will always go to the end with a

71
00:02:59.857 --> 00:03:02.105
negative one and that will span it to the end.

72
00:03:02.105 --> 00:03:04.898
And if we were to change this to something like

73
00:03:04.898 --> 00:03:07.764
10 columns or 20 columns it will always

74
00:03:07.764 --> 00:03:10.582
go into the end regardless of how many

75
00:03:10.582 --> 00:03:13.318
columns we are actually having.

76
00:03:13.318 --> 00:03:15.844
Good, next one: "Make item five

77
00:03:15.844 --> 00:03:19.434
"double span tow columns and two rows."

78
00:03:19.434 --> 00:03:21.436
So dot item five.

79
00:03:21.436 --> 00:03:24.436
We want to say grid-column span two.

80
00:03:26.755 --> 00:03:27.694
Good.

81
00:03:27.694 --> 00:03:31.009
And we also want a grid-row span two.

82
00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:33.547
And it's going to be two wide and two high.

83
00:03:33.547 --> 00:03:36.166
"Make item eight two rows high."

84
00:03:36.166 --> 00:03:39.833
Item eight, what is that, grid-row span two.

85
00:03:42.747 --> 00:03:44.667
Oh, that didn't work.

86
00:03:44.667 --> 00:03:45.917
Um, item eight.

87
00:03:46.885 --> 00:03:48.074
Obviously it didn't work 'cause

88
00:03:48.074 --> 00:03:50.119
I didn't select the right one.

89
00:03:50.119 --> 00:03:53.384
"Make item 15 span the entire grid width."

90
00:03:53.384 --> 00:03:54.325
Ooo.

91
00:03:54.325 --> 00:03:58.061
Item 15, so we're going to say grid-column,

92
00:03:58.061 --> 00:04:01.821
and remember the trick, we're gonna start it at one.

93
00:04:01.821 --> 00:04:02.654
That works.

94
00:04:02.654 --> 00:04:05.141
And we're going to end it at the end, negative one.

95
00:04:05.141 --> 00:04:07.343
And that will span the entire width, good.

96
00:04:07.343 --> 00:04:11.723
"Make item 18 span four widths, but end at nine."

97
00:04:11.723 --> 00:04:13.235
huh.

98
00:04:13.235 --> 00:04:14.652
Okay so, item 18.

99
00:04:15.966 --> 00:04:20.133
We want it to span four, so grid-column span four.

100
00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:26.153
But we want to end it at nine, so we just say nine.

101
00:04:26.153 --> 00:04:28.736
And what that will do is, here we go, 18.

102
00:04:28.736 --> 00:04:31.797
It will anchier it at the end of line nine,

103
00:04:31.797 --> 00:04:34.900
and then it will size itself four out from there,

104
00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:36.820
so that's kind of neat to anchier it based on

105
00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:40.215
where it will finish itself not where it will start.

106
00:04:40.215 --> 00:04:44.248
And: "Make item 20 start at row four and go for three."

107
00:04:44.248 --> 00:04:45.498
So dot item 20.

108
00:04:46.633 --> 00:04:48.656
You want to grid-row.

109
00:04:48.656 --> 00:04:52.600
We want to start it at row four, and go for three.

110
00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:53.767
So span three.

111
00:04:55.636 --> 00:04:57.238
And where do we got it?

112
00:04:57.238 --> 00:04:59.373
Item 20, there we go.

113
00:04:59.373 --> 00:05:00.206
It's going up.

114
00:05:00.206 --> 00:05:02.223
Again, these empty spaces, we're gonna learn

115
00:05:02.223 --> 00:05:04.406
all about that when we talk about dense.

116
00:05:04.406 --> 00:05:05.760
Good, I'm really happy with that.

117
00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:07.164
Hopefully you are a little bit more

118
00:05:07.164 --> 00:05:08.955
comfortable with placing them.

119
00:05:08.955 --> 00:05:10.476
Let's move onto the next which is

120
00:05:10.476 --> 00:05:13.408
talking about auto fill and auto fit.

121
00:05:13.408 --> 00:05:15.825
