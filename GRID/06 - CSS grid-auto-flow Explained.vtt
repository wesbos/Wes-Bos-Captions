(upbeat music)

2
00:00:03.914 --> 00:00:05.290
<v Instructor>In the last video we talked about how</v>

3
00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:07.461
when you explicitly define you're columns

4
00:00:07.461 --> 00:00:09.509
and you don't define any rows,

5
00:00:09.509 --> 00:00:11.282
they are just automatically created

6
00:00:11.282 --> 00:00:13.162
which is what we call implicit.

7
00:00:13.162 --> 00:00:15.730
Now lets talk about this things called grid auto flow.

8
00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:18.290
And I don't think this is something you're gonna be using

9
00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:21.790
all the time because it determines if your

10
00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:25.602
new elements are added as rows or as columns.

11
00:00:25.602 --> 00:00:28.050
But lets learn it in case you ever do want to do

12
00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.261
one of those horizontally scrolling elements.

13
00:00:31.261 --> 00:00:35.329
So lets open up 06 and auto flow start.

14
00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:38.890
I've got two items here and I've displayed gridded it.

15
00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:41.202
Lets turn on our div tools just to make sure

16
00:00:41.202 --> 00:00:42.989
we're sort of watching what's going on here.

17
00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.813
Now lets add two columns real quick.

18
00:00:44.813 --> 00:00:46.896
So grid template columns.

19
00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:50.911
400px 200px.

20
00:00:50.911 --> 00:00:52.293
Good, give it a save

21
00:00:52.293 --> 00:00:55.471
and you see that we have one row, two columns

22
00:00:55.471 --> 00:00:58.293
and we've explicitly defined the two columns.

23
00:00:58.293 --> 00:01:00.453
Now what happens when we add a third item.

24
00:01:00.453 --> 00:01:03.406
Well you should know this by now.

25
00:01:03.406 --> 00:01:06.973
It will automatically be wrapped onto the next line

26
00:01:06.973 --> 00:01:10.253
and we will have an implicit row that has been created.

27
00:01:10.253 --> 00:01:12.813
Now grid autoflow, what that will do

28
00:01:12.813 --> 00:01:14.755
is it will determine whether

29
00:01:14.755 --> 00:01:18.424
when you need to add another row or column

30
00:01:18.424 --> 00:01:22.093
because we've only defined enough for two spots here

31
00:01:22.093 --> 00:01:23.533
but we have three.

32
00:01:23.533 --> 00:01:25.554
So what do we do with the extra?

33
00:01:25.554 --> 00:01:28.373
It will define whether that is then created in a row,

34
00:01:28.373 --> 00:01:31.401
which is the default, or if it tacks it onto

35
00:01:31.401 --> 00:01:32.573
the right hand side over here.

36
00:01:32.573 --> 00:01:34.594
Or actually one little neat thing is

37
00:01:34.594 --> 00:01:38.683
depending on which direction your language is in,

38
00:01:38.683 --> 00:01:42.514
some languages CSS grid will read left to right,

39
00:01:42.514 --> 00:01:44.955
but that's another video.

40
00:01:44.955 --> 00:01:47.413
So it will determine whether it will tack it onto

41
00:01:47.413 --> 00:01:49.032
a row or another column.

42
00:01:49.032 --> 00:01:51.613
So by default, we can go in here and we can say

43
00:01:51.613 --> 00:01:52.863
grid auto flow.

44
00:01:54.405 --> 00:01:56.824
And if we say row, it's not gonna do anything,

45
00:01:56.824 --> 00:01:58.173
because that's the default.

46
00:01:58.173 --> 00:02:00.184
The other option is column.

47
00:02:00.184 --> 00:02:02.883
And what that will do, woo, look what we got here.

48
00:02:02.883 --> 00:02:06.224
Lets change this to black and see what we've got.

49
00:02:06.224 --> 00:02:09.165
Now you can see that the extra item

50
00:02:09.165 --> 00:02:11.605
is not being created as a row

51
00:02:11.605 --> 00:02:14.654
but it is now being created as an extra column.

52
00:02:14.654 --> 00:02:16.569
So as we add extra items in here.

53
00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:18.149
Ba da da da do do.

54
00:02:18.149 --> 00:02:21.341
You'll see that they are all automatically added

55
00:02:21.341 --> 00:02:24.580
and they will go to the right and eventually cause

56
00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.518
a horizontal scroll to actually happen.

57
00:02:27.518 --> 00:02:31.685
And then we can also go in here and say grid auto columns.

58
00:02:32.531 --> 00:02:35.291
Maybe we want them to be 200 pixels wide.

59
00:02:35.291 --> 00:02:38.651
And now this grid auto columns is saying

60
00:02:38.651 --> 00:02:43.248
anything that, any columns that have been implicitly created

61
00:02:43.248 --> 00:02:45.269
do I need to zoom in?

62
00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:48.549
Dotted line, that means it's being implicitly created.

63
00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:52.341
You see the solid one defines where the explicit grid ends.

64
00:02:52.341 --> 00:02:54.763
Then those will be 200 pixels

65
00:02:54.763 --> 00:02:56.173
and you can see that they scroll.

66
00:02:56.173 --> 00:02:58.752
And I've got some fun stuff going on with my background here

67
00:02:58.752 --> 00:03:02.803
because of the gradient that starts and stops.

68
00:03:02.803 --> 00:03:07.181
So, again, I haven't found a whole lot of use case for that.

69
00:03:07.181 --> 00:03:10.500
Maybe you will find a use case for wanting them

70
00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.712
to go left to right or right to left

71
00:03:12.712 --> 00:03:14.093
instead of top to bottom.

72
00:03:14.093 --> 00:03:16.413
In flex mox we sorta have a similar thing

73
00:03:16.413 --> 00:03:19.541
with flex direction, which be default

74
00:03:19.541 --> 00:03:21.820
when you add a flex item they go left to right

75
00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:24.573
but you can also flip it to be a column

76
00:03:24.573 --> 00:03:27.442
and it will go top to bottom as well as reverse.

77
00:03:27.442 --> 00:03:29.981
There is no reverse in CSS grid.

78
00:03:29.981 --> 00:03:33.032
Other than that, that is grid auto flow.

79
00:03:33.032 --> 00:03:35.603
You can change it to row or column or

80
00:03:35.603 --> 00:03:37.781
and the pretty cool one is actually this

81
00:03:37.781 --> 00:03:40.021
called grid auto flow dense.

82
00:03:40.021 --> 00:03:41.632
But that's pretty cool.

83
00:03:41.632 --> 00:03:44.112
It will sort of like fit them in where there's space

84
00:03:44.112 --> 00:03:46.001
but we need to learn a little bit more about

85
00:03:46.001 --> 00:03:48.363
sizing these actual items first,

86
00:03:48.363 --> 00:03:50.501
before we can get into that dense one.

87
00:03:50.501 --> 00:03:52.072
See you in the next one.

88
00:03:52.072 --> 00:03:54.521
