<v ->Alright, let's talk about how to get</v>

3
00:00:04.612 --> 00:00:07.673
sort of a Bootstrap CSS Grid in place.

4
00:00:07.673 --> 00:00:09.877
And while I think that you should try to,

5
00:00:09.877 --> 00:00:11.945
I always tell people to embrace the flex.

6
00:00:11.945 --> 00:00:15.803
Meaning, Grid is by nature very flexible,

7
00:00:15.803 --> 00:00:19.151
very responsive, very able to sort of flex

8
00:00:19.151 --> 00:00:20.915
to the actual size of the content

9
00:00:20.915 --> 00:00:24.965
as well as how much extra space is around.

10
00:00:24.965 --> 00:00:28.160
Whereas these Bootstrap based grids are extremely rigid,

11
00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.792
in that you have 12 columns and you start to add them up.

12
00:00:31.792 --> 00:00:35.330
So, first of all try to maybe adjust your zine

13
00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:37.716
so that they work with how much content you have,

14
00:00:37.716 --> 00:00:40.684
but that said, there is still valid use cases

15
00:00:40.684 --> 00:00:43.717
for having a very rigid grid system.

16
00:00:43.717 --> 00:00:47.254
So what you can do is, I've got this four items here.

17
00:00:47.254 --> 00:00:48.947
I'm going to go to my grid and chop it up

18
00:00:48.947 --> 00:00:51.016
into 12 different columns.

19
00:00:51.016 --> 00:00:52.491
So we'll go in here and we'll say

20
00:00:52.491 --> 00:00:56.658
grid-template-columns: repeat(12, 1fr)

21
00:00:57.783 --> 00:01:01.608
and we will also forget the display grid

22
00:01:01.608 --> 00:01:04.125
on the actual item itself.

23
00:01:04.125 --> 00:01:04.958
Good.

24
00:01:04.958 --> 00:01:08.394
Now, and we'll put some grid gap on there.

25
00:01:08.394 --> 00:01:09.227
Beautiful.

26
00:01:09.227 --> 00:01:10.506
Now we've got 12 different columns.

27
00:01:10.506 --> 00:01:13.336
Each one eating itself up.

28
00:01:13.336 --> 00:01:16.033
Now, I'm gonna show you one little like bug that I ran into.

29
00:01:16.033 --> 00:01:18.687
I'm not sure if it's a bug or by design or whatever.

30
00:01:18.687 --> 00:01:21.902
But if one of these things has like wesbos in it,

31
00:01:21.902 --> 00:01:23.212
it's a bit wider.

32
00:01:23.212 --> 00:01:26.345
You'll notice that now they are not equal,

33
00:01:26.345 --> 00:01:28.256
because what does fr stand for?

34
00:01:28.256 --> 00:01:29.939
Free space right?

35
00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.531
And what happens is CSS Grid lays the items

36
00:01:33.531 --> 00:01:36.018
out that it needs to first and then will

37
00:01:36.018 --> 00:01:38.762
distribute the rest of the spots to it.

38
00:01:38.762 --> 00:01:41.431
So this is eating into our free space.

39
00:01:41.431 --> 00:01:42.548
So what do you have to do?

40
00:01:42.548 --> 00:01:44.586
Do you have to take your 100% divide it by 12

41
00:01:44.586 --> 00:01:47.238
and make each one 8.3%?

42
00:01:47.238 --> 00:01:48.426
Well that still really doesn't work,

43
00:01:48.426 --> 00:01:50.270
because you've got this grid-gap.

44
00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.270
So do you have to like calc 8.3% - 20px,

45
00:01:57.473 --> 00:01:59.053
well that also doesn't work, because there's

46
00:01:59.053 --> 00:02:01.425
no margin on the left or the right.

47
00:02:01.425 --> 00:02:03.851
Or clack, you get the point right?

48
00:02:03.851 --> 00:02:06.809
It's not ideal to have to be able to do something like that.

49
00:02:06.809 --> 00:02:09.585
So what I have found as a fix for that is

50
00:02:09.585 --> 00:02:13.022
either you can go onto your item and give yourself

51
00:02:13.022 --> 00:02:17.054
a min-width of zero and that will make each one

52
00:02:17.054 --> 00:02:20.100
actually the same size and then you can deal

53
00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.241
with any overflowing text or whatever.

54
00:02:23.241 --> 00:02:25.065
Accordingly, which is great.

55
00:02:25.065 --> 00:02:28.994
Or, and let me just double check that looks the same

56
00:02:28.994 --> 00:02:30.145
in Chrome, yep.

57
00:02:30.145 --> 00:02:33.164
So it works in Chrome as well.

58
00:02:33.164 --> 00:02:35.450
But, I think ideally you would do

59
00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:37.407
something like this, instead we'll bring back

60
00:02:37.407 --> 00:02:41.411
that actual error here and we will do a minmax.

61
00:02:41.411 --> 00:02:45.100
And you give it a min-width of zero and a max of 1fr.

62
00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:46.676
That will give it a min-width of zero

63
00:02:46.676 --> 00:02:48.011
and then however we still have to go on

64
00:02:48.011 --> 00:02:51.293
to our item and give it a width of 100%.

65
00:02:51.293 --> 00:02:53.980
And that will snap it back to what we're looking for.

66
00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:55.937
Either one will work for you.

67
00:02:55.937 --> 00:02:58.249
Sometimes you're gonna already going to be using minmax

68
00:02:58.249 --> 00:03:00.662
so you can use that and just pop the width on there.

69
00:03:00.662 --> 00:03:02.951
Otherwise you can pop a min-width, any width

70
00:03:02.951 --> 00:03:04.283
on each individual one.

71
00:03:04.283 --> 00:03:05.585
Let's go back to Chrome, double check

72
00:03:05.585 --> 00:03:07.663
that's still looking exactly the same.

73
00:03:07.663 --> 00:03:08.496
Good.

74
00:03:08.496 --> 00:03:10.973
Now that we have this, what we can do is

75
00:03:10.973 --> 00:03:14.304
we can start to go spanning our different items.

76
00:03:14.304 --> 00:03:16.550
And one cool way that we could do that

77
00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:18.368
is with CSSs variables.

78
00:03:18.368 --> 00:03:20.215
So you could make a whole grid framework.

79
00:03:20.215 --> 00:03:22.199
And I'm sure there'll be lots of frameworks

80
00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:25.290
announced where you have like span three

81
00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:28.290
or something like that, and that will span three for you.

82
00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.000
But we could also do something like this.

83
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.453
We could say grid-column, and that is

84
00:03:33.453 --> 00:03:36.529
going to just span one, each one of those will span one.

85
00:03:36.529 --> 00:03:38.272
That's the actual default.

86
00:03:38.272 --> 00:03:41.182
But we could change that to a variable

87
00:03:41.182 --> 00:03:43.775
where we could make a variable called span

88
00:03:43.775 --> 00:03:45.892
and set that to be one.

89
00:03:45.892 --> 00:03:49.426
And then set that variable here to be span.

90
00:03:49.426 --> 00:03:51.924
And then in each of your items,

91
00:03:51.924 --> 00:03:53.480
you can overwrite that variable

92
00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:55.386
with an inline style attribute.

93
00:03:55.386 --> 00:03:58.886
You could say something like --span three.

94
00:04:01.343 --> 00:04:04.039
And then it's going to override that span variable

95
00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:07.313
on the item and it's gonna kick in to there.

96
00:04:07.313 --> 00:04:08.555
So whatever you feel like.

97
00:04:08.555 --> 00:04:09.988
I think some people still might prefer

98
00:04:09.988 --> 00:04:12.740
just a nice clean class of span three.

99
00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:14.603
But it's kind of neat that you can

100
00:04:14.603 --> 00:04:18.601
also use CSS variables in order to dice it up.

101
00:04:18.601 --> 00:04:21.002
Similarily you could also use that on your grid.

102
00:04:21.002 --> 00:04:23.434
Where you could say style and then you could say

103
00:04:23.434 --> 00:04:25.267
<v ->-cols is equal to 10.</v>

104
00:04:26.414 --> 00:04:28.686
And if I only wanted 10 columns, I could

105
00:04:28.686 --> 00:04:31.699
go into here and I could then say

106
00:04:31.699 --> 00:04:35.699
right here var--cols, and that would give me 10.

107
00:04:36.831 --> 00:04:39.726
And I believe var will also give you a fallback,

108
00:04:39.726 --> 00:04:42.617
so if it's not there you can fall back to 12

109
00:04:42.617 --> 00:04:44.789
rather than having to set a variable like I did here.

110
00:04:44.789 --> 00:04:46.657
I just showed you two different ways that we can do it.

111
00:04:46.657 --> 00:04:48.316
So there we go that's 10, and if I were to

112
00:04:48.316 --> 00:04:51.816
remove the number of columns that we have,

113
00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:55.020
then it will fall back to 12.

114
00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:57.390
That is how you do a rigid Bootstrap grid.

115
00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:58.971
Let's actually fill this up here.

116
00:04:58.971 --> 00:04:59.804
So, seven.

117
00:05:01.747 --> 00:05:03.999
Good so we've filled up all of our spots here.

118
00:05:03.999 --> 00:05:05.445
And then in this one, let's actually do

119
00:05:05.445 --> 00:05:08.297
another nested grid inside of it.

120
00:05:08.297 --> 00:05:09.130
So,

121
00:05:10.001 --> 00:05:13.530
we'll go say .grid and then inside of that

122
00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:17.697
we'll have items, maybe you'll say style equals --cols two.

123
00:05:20.173 --> 00:05:23.288
Item times two, one and two.

124
00:05:23.288 --> 00:05:27.455
And that will dice up it further into columns one and two.

125
00:05:28.451 --> 00:05:31.018
You will get the sort of the double grid-gap

126
00:05:31.018 --> 00:05:33.011
happening here and if you would like to get

127
00:05:33.011 --> 00:05:35.116
rid of that so you have clean lines.

128
00:05:35.116 --> 00:05:36.693
You can use a negative margin

129
00:05:36.693 --> 00:05:39.963
that would offset it the same amount of the grid-gap.

130
00:05:39.963 --> 00:05:41.169
So hopefully that helps.

131
00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:43.676
I'm still not sure if people are going to

132
00:05:43.676 --> 00:05:47.528
migrate more towards using a CSS Grid framework.

133
00:05:47.528 --> 00:05:50.689
Like maybe Foundation or whatever will come out with one,

134
00:05:50.689 --> 00:05:53.428
or if this will just be enough.

135
00:05:53.428 --> 00:05:56.552
And for myself, I haven't used a grid framework

136
00:05:56.552 --> 00:05:59.385
in many years just 'cause of I think that it's easier

137
00:05:59.385 --> 00:06:01.945
to do it with Flexbox but that's another personal

138
00:06:01.945 --> 00:06:03.682
choice that you can make yourself.
