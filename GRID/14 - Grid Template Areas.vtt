(hard rock music)

2
00:00:04.291 --> 00:00:05.718
<v ->Back in videos nine and 10,</v>

3
00:00:05.718 --> 00:00:08.965
we looked at how we can size grid items by spanning them,

4
00:00:08.965 --> 00:00:10.194
and we looked at how we can put them

5
00:00:10.194 --> 00:00:11.686
where we want them to go

6
00:00:11.686 --> 00:00:15.181
by using the track numbers where they start and stop,

7
00:00:15.181 --> 00:00:17.089
or we just specifying where they stop,

8
00:00:17.089 --> 00:00:19.287
or if they were to span across the entire grid.

9
00:00:19.287 --> 00:00:20.393
Now there was a couple other ways

10
00:00:20.393 --> 00:00:22.899
we can also both size and place our items,

11
00:00:22.899 --> 00:00:25.363
and that is using something called grid template areas.

12
00:00:25.363 --> 00:00:28.741
And that's giving specific names to areas on your grid.

13
00:00:28.741 --> 00:00:32.302
So, first thing we wanna do is actually make some,

14
00:00:32.302 --> 00:00:34.328
areas in our grids.

15
00:00:34.328 --> 00:00:36.220
So I'm going to to make a quick grid.

16
00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:39.029
I kinda wanna make your standard website

17
00:00:39.029 --> 00:00:41.428
with a sidebar on the left and a sidebar on the right,

18
00:00:41.428 --> 00:00:42.788
and some content in the middle,

19
00:00:42.788 --> 00:00:44.342
and then a footer across the bottom.

20
00:00:44.342 --> 00:00:46.618
So, that's going to be a, sort of,

21
00:00:46.618 --> 00:00:47.717
a three-column grid.

22
00:00:47.717 --> 00:00:50.467
So I'll say grid-template-column.

23
00:00:51.391 --> 00:00:54.058
And I'm gonna say 1fr 500px 1fr,

24
00:00:55.383 --> 00:00:56.325
and what that should do is

25
00:00:56.325 --> 00:00:58.409
it'll give us this 500 pixel middle,

26
00:00:58.409 --> 00:01:00.390
and then whatever's left on the left and the right,

27
00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.856
will be taken up accordingly by the sidebars.

28
00:01:03.856 --> 00:01:07.439
And then, let's flip on our dev tools here.

29
00:01:08.362 --> 00:01:11.445
I also want to specify a couple rows.

30
00:01:12.921 --> 00:01:16.171
So I'm going to say grid-template-rows,

31
00:01:18.434 --> 00:01:22.601
and we'll have, let's say, 150px 150px, and 100px.

32
00:01:26.885 --> 00:01:30.175
Good. So I've got a grid, sort of three by three here.

33
00:01:30.175 --> 00:01:33.452
Now what I wanna do, is to actually name the areas.

34
00:01:33.452 --> 00:01:34.632
I want this,

35
00:01:34.632 --> 00:01:36.109
these two squares right here.

36
00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:38.836
I want that to be sidebar-1.

37
00:01:38.836 --> 00:01:41.419
These two squares I want to be sidebar-2.

38
00:01:41.419 --> 00:01:44.400
This whole center column I wanna be called content.

39
00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.454
And then the strip along the bottom

40
00:01:46.454 --> 00:01:48.616
I want that to be called the footer.

41
00:01:48.616 --> 00:01:50.607
So the way that we do that is,

42
00:01:50.607 --> 00:01:52.411
it's actually kind of,

43
00:01:52.411 --> 00:01:53.244
it kind of funny.

44
00:01:53.244 --> 00:01:54.184
It's very explicit.

45
00:01:54.184 --> 00:01:56.041
You simply just, sort of, like,

46
00:01:56.041 --> 00:01:57.701
type it as if it were ASCIIs.

47
00:01:57.701 --> 00:02:01.251
So we'll say grid-template-areas,

48
00:02:01.251 --> 00:02:05.021
and then for each row, you give yourselves a set of quotes,

49
00:02:05.021 --> 00:02:07.815
and then you just type the name of the area

50
00:02:07.815 --> 00:02:08.993
that you wish for it to be.

51
00:02:08.993 --> 00:02:12.743
So I'm gonna say sidebar-1 content sidebar-2.

52
00:02:14.548 --> 00:02:17.698
And then, if I give that a save, you'll see now,

53
00:02:17.698 --> 00:02:19.663
and make sure that you have your dev tools on,

54
00:02:19.663 --> 00:02:24.161
and this, this one right here, Display area names.

55
00:02:24.161 --> 00:02:25.760
You see that it starts to overlay it

56
00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.287
with the name of this area.

57
00:02:27.287 --> 00:02:28.607
It's called sidebar-1.

58
00:02:28.607 --> 00:02:29.987
The name of this area is called sidebar-2,

59
00:02:29.987 --> 00:02:31.092
and this area is content.

60
00:02:31.092 --> 00:02:31.925
Good.

61
00:02:31.925 --> 00:02:33.718
But I also want these areas as well.

62
00:02:33.718 --> 00:02:37.656
So what you can do, and this is a bit funky syntax, as well,

63
00:02:37.656 --> 00:02:38.823
is you do not,

64
00:02:40.877 --> 00:02:42.967
put a comma, or anything like that.

65
00:02:42.967 --> 00:02:45.681
You simply just put another set of quotes.

66
00:02:45.681 --> 00:02:47.510
And this can all be done on one line.

67
00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:50.096
In fact, some editors can catenate them like that.

68
00:02:50.096 --> 00:02:53.200
But I like to put each one on it's own line,

69
00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.209
and that will just kinda give me a visual

70
00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:56.643
of what we're working with.

71
00:02:56.643 --> 00:02:58.111
So if I give that a save now,

72
00:02:58.111 --> 00:03:00.275
you'll see sidebar-1, sidebar-1,

73
00:03:00.275 --> 00:03:01.941
sidebar-2, sidebar-2,

74
00:03:01.941 --> 00:03:04.077
and content, content.

75
00:03:04.077 --> 00:03:04.910
Good!

76
00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:05.743
And then the last row I want

77
00:03:05.743 --> 00:03:08.410
to just be footer footer footer.

78
00:03:10.665 --> 00:03:12.937
And that will line up the footer all across the end.

79
00:03:12.937 --> 00:03:13.886
If you ever have,

80
00:03:13.886 --> 00:03:15.279
you want like a dead space,

81
00:03:15.279 --> 00:03:17.564
like maybe you didn't want this to be anything,

82
00:03:17.564 --> 00:03:19.446
you can just put a dot there,

83
00:03:19.446 --> 00:03:22.543
and that will just leave it to be just a regular old spot

84
00:03:22.543 --> 00:03:25.952
that you could use with the other methods that we've had.

85
00:03:25.952 --> 00:03:26.785
But in our case,

86
00:03:26.785 --> 00:03:28.243
I want it to be footer footer footer.

87
00:03:28.243 --> 00:03:29.412
So it's kinda like, you can just, like,

88
00:03:29.412 --> 00:03:30.927
look at this,

89
00:03:30.927 --> 00:03:34.196
and you could see that you can visualize

90
00:03:34.196 --> 00:03:35.064
what it will look like.

91
00:03:35.064 --> 00:03:37.008
And some people will also use tabs,

92
00:03:37.008 --> 00:03:40.639
so that it'll all nice line itself up.

93
00:03:40.639 --> 00:03:42.990
That is totally doable as well.

94
00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:46.030
Just so you can, sorta, visualize what's going on here.

95
00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:46.863
Good.

96
00:03:46.863 --> 00:03:49.102
Now, when I wanna place my items in these areas,

97
00:03:49.102 --> 00:03:50.998
I don't have to worry about line numbers,

98
00:03:50.998 --> 00:03:52.036
or anything like that.

99
00:03:52.036 --> 00:03:54.282
I can just go ahead and grab on to,

100
00:03:54.282 --> 00:03:56.162
let's do the footer first.

101
00:03:56.162 --> 00:03:58.662
And you say grid-area: footer.

102
00:03:59.518 --> 00:04:01.910
And then it will just both size it,

103
00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:04.367
and place it where we want it to go.

104
00:04:04.367 --> 00:04:05.712
We don't have to say how big it is.

105
00:04:05.712 --> 00:04:07.226
We don't have to say where it's gonna go.

106
00:04:07.226 --> 00:04:09.159
We simply just say that it is the footer,

107
00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:11.438
and then it will go there.

108
00:04:11.438 --> 00:04:13.620
It'll span it across the entire region.

109
00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.033
So, let's do the rest now.

110
00:04:15.033 --> 00:04:17.616
So, .item1 was grid.area, whoa!

111
00:04:21.834 --> 00:04:24.417
Grid-area:, that was sidebar-1.

112
00:04:26.215 --> 00:04:27.079
Good.

113
00:04:27.079 --> 00:04:29.329
And then item2 was content,

114
00:04:33.459 --> 00:04:35.459
and item3 was sidebar-2.

115
00:04:40.421 --> 00:04:41.254
Beautiful.

116
00:04:41.254 --> 00:04:45.898
Now it's all perfectly lining up where we want it to go.

117
00:04:45.898 --> 00:04:47.647
And, now, the cool thing about that is

118
00:04:47.647 --> 00:04:50.199
we could start to involve some media queries

119
00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:53.147
that would simply just switch up what this would look like.

120
00:04:53.147 --> 00:04:56.147
So, if I were to make a media query,

121
00:04:57.633 --> 00:05:01.446
I can simply just redefine the template areas

122
00:05:01.446 --> 00:05:02.297
as we need them.

123
00:05:02.297 --> 00:05:06.385
So I'll select my container at once we hit 700 pixels,

124
00:05:06.385 --> 00:05:09.102
and I'm just gonna say background: red.

125
00:05:09.102 --> 00:05:11.117
Make sure this media query is actually working.

126
00:05:11.117 --> 00:05:14.435
Let's hit 700 pixels. There we go, it's kicking in.

127
00:05:14.435 --> 00:05:16.273
Good. I'm happy with that.

128
00:05:16.273 --> 00:05:18.949
And, I can just redefine what my template areas are.

129
00:05:18.949 --> 00:05:20.866
So I'm gonna take this.

130
00:05:21.864 --> 00:05:24.447
I'm going to redefine it to be,

131
00:05:26.292 --> 00:05:27.625
content content,

132
00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:30.730
content,

133
00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:32.397
sidebar-1 sidebar-1,

134
00:05:35.148 --> 00:05:36.253
sidebar-2,

135
00:05:36.253 --> 00:05:37.646
footer footer footer,

136
00:05:37.646 --> 00:05:40.063
and now, as I get it smaller,

137
00:05:41.679 --> 00:05:44.455
you'll see that the layout totally jumps,

138
00:05:44.455 --> 00:05:48.353
and it will then put the content up top,

139
00:05:48.353 --> 00:05:51.804
and I'm not totally doing this justice,

140
00:05:51.804 --> 00:05:53.773
because I've used pixels here.

141
00:05:53.773 --> 00:05:56.193
But if I was to use all fr units,

142
00:05:56.193 --> 00:05:57.693
maybe, like, 10fr,

143
00:05:58.845 --> 00:06:01.876
and then the rows would each be,

144
00:06:01.876 --> 00:06:03.459
the rows doesn't matter, actually.

145
00:06:03.459 --> 00:06:04.417
There we go.

146
00:06:04.417 --> 00:06:07.686
As it gets smaller, the content will jump up top,

147
00:06:07.686 --> 00:06:10.359
and the sidebar values go right down below it,

148
00:06:10.359 --> 00:06:12.705
and then the footer is still exactly where I want it.

149
00:06:12.705 --> 00:06:13.538
So, sometimes,

150
00:06:13.538 --> 00:06:15.471
the only thing you need to do in your media queries,

151
00:06:15.471 --> 00:06:18.041
is simply just redefine what the layout looks like,

152
00:06:18.041 --> 00:06:19.913
and everything will sort of snap to.

153
00:06:19.913 --> 00:06:23.769
And in this case, I could also redefine more columns,

154
00:06:23.769 --> 00:06:26.411
where if you wanted sidebar-1 and sidebar-2

155
00:06:26.411 --> 00:06:27.299
to both have four,

156
00:06:27.299 --> 00:06:31.302
I could use these values up here to define even more.

157
00:06:31.302 --> 00:06:33.205
So, that is grid template areas.

158
00:06:33.205 --> 00:06:34.419
It's pretty neat.

159
00:06:34.419 --> 00:06:39.180
Not everybody loves the idea behind making ASCII,

160
00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:41.940
but it sure is a lot nicer than having to remember

161
00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:43.872
exactly what the columns are,

162
00:06:43.872 --> 00:06:46.334
because if you were to ever change the number columns,

163
00:06:46.334 --> 00:06:48.542
it doesn't really matter in this case.

164
00:06:48.542 --> 00:06:50.802
So, we're in really good shape.

165
00:06:50.802 --> 00:06:51.648
Other than that,

166
00:06:51.648 --> 00:06:54.508
we've got some other ways to place and size our stuff,

167
00:06:54.508 --> 00:06:56.629
and then we'll get into that into the next video.

168
00:06:56.629 --> 00:06:59.141
All right, let's switch over to another example,

169
00:06:59.141 --> 00:07:01.282
and that is understanding that,

170
00:07:01.282 --> 00:07:02.929
when you create grid areas,

171
00:07:02.929 --> 00:07:05.310
you also get line names for free,

172
00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:06.354
which is pretty neat.

173
00:07:06.354 --> 00:07:09.052
So, open up area-line-names-START,

174
00:07:09.052 --> 00:07:11.915
and I've just got a whole bunch of numbers here.

175
00:07:11.915 --> 00:07:13.818
And, what I want to do,

176
00:07:13.818 --> 00:07:16.261
is actually make a grid

177
00:07:16.261 --> 00:07:19.177
without defining any columns or rows.

178
00:07:19.177 --> 00:07:20.647
We're simply just going to make the grid

179
00:07:20.647 --> 00:07:21.814
with the grid,

180
00:07:26.152 --> 00:07:28.856
we're simply just going to make the grid with the grid area.

181
00:07:28.856 --> 00:07:31.523
So we'll say grid-template-area,

182
00:07:32.566 --> 00:07:33.998
and I'm gonna go on the new line,

183
00:07:33.998 --> 00:07:37.104
and in this case, I'm going to use an emoji poop.

184
00:07:37.104 --> 00:07:38.734
Whoa!

185
00:07:38.734 --> 00:07:40.933
Two, three, four.

186
00:07:40.933 --> 00:07:43.002
I'm gonna do, yeah, I'll do four poops,

187
00:07:43.002 --> 00:07:44.669
and four hamburgers.

188
00:07:47.725 --> 00:07:49.832
Two, three, four hamburgers.

189
00:07:49.832 --> 00:07:54.036
And then I'll just duplicate that over four times.

190
00:07:54.036 --> 00:07:55.448
Good. Give that a save.

191
00:07:55.448 --> 00:07:57.781
And, I spelt template wrong.

192
00:08:03.324 --> 00:08:05.241
And, something's wrong.

193
00:08:07.676 --> 00:08:10.576
Grid-template-areas, with an S on the end! Good.

194
00:08:10.576 --> 00:08:13.409
So, if I turn on my dev tools now,

195
00:08:14.515 --> 00:08:16.395
you'll see that, (laughs)

196
00:08:16.395 --> 00:08:20.179
we have emojis overlapping where all of the actual areas go,

197
00:08:20.179 --> 00:08:21.887
and it's just pretty neat.

198
00:08:21.887 --> 00:08:24.637
And, if you wanted to, you could do something like,

199
00:08:24.637 --> 00:08:27.887
.item3, I'm gonna say grid-area:, poop,

200
00:08:30.452 --> 00:08:32.881
and that will just cover the entire poop area.

201
00:08:32.881 --> 00:08:36.626
Actually, what is interesting about this is, tell me,

202
00:08:36.626 --> 00:08:38.005
tell me what is happening here,

203
00:08:38.005 --> 00:08:42.570
where we just made eight across, and four down,

204
00:08:42.570 --> 00:08:45.338
and we have not enough room,

205
00:08:45.338 --> 00:08:48.443
because we've got more items than we have space for.

206
00:08:48.443 --> 00:08:50.124
So, what is happening here,

207
00:08:50.124 --> 00:08:53.061
if I turn on the black lines,

208
00:08:53.061 --> 00:08:57.563
is that we have, sort of, this explicit grid area for poop,

209
00:08:57.563 --> 00:09:00.171
and explicit grid area for hamburgers,

210
00:09:00.171 --> 00:09:03.410
and then as we are out of space, what happens?

211
00:09:03.410 --> 00:09:07.575
Well, it automatically creates additional rows,

212
00:09:07.575 --> 00:09:08.963
which are implicit, right?

213
00:09:08.963 --> 00:09:10.683
I know I've gone over that over and over,

214
00:09:10.683 --> 00:09:13.494
but it's really important that we understand that.

215
00:09:13.494 --> 00:09:14.806
However, I do not wanna show you

216
00:09:14.806 --> 00:09:17.057
how you can just place it in the poop area.

217
00:09:17.057 --> 00:09:18.620
We want to show you

218
00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:21.926
how you can actually these on named lines,

219
00:09:21.926 --> 00:09:24.072
rather than just the numbered lines.

220
00:09:24.072 --> 00:09:26.684
So, previously, we had done something like this,

221
00:09:26.684 --> 00:09:30.851
like grid-column, and we did something like start at two,

222
00:09:32.503 --> 00:09:35.085
and go until line five,

223
00:09:35.085 --> 00:09:38.008
and that would span this item here.

224
00:09:38.008 --> 00:09:39.058
Well, what's neat about that is

225
00:09:39.058 --> 00:09:42.003
we can actually use line names,

226
00:09:42.003 --> 00:09:43.336
like poop-start,

227
00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:48.683
and we want to end it where poop-end,

228
00:09:51.386 --> 00:09:52.648
and give that a save.

229
00:09:52.648 --> 00:09:54.002
So what's happening here is

230
00:09:54.002 --> 00:09:57.019
every time you have a grid area named anything,

231
00:09:57.019 --> 00:09:59.766
and, before, it might be content or sidebar-1,

232
00:09:59.766 --> 00:10:02.411
but in our case, it's poop, an emoji poop.

233
00:10:02.411 --> 00:10:06.823
And then we can tack on a -start, or a -end,

234
00:10:06.823 --> 00:10:08.949
and these are lines, and, unfortunately,

235
00:10:08.949 --> 00:10:11.831
the dev tools doesn't show us the names of these lines,

236
00:10:11.831 --> 00:10:14.882
but they are sort of lines that come for free in the browser

237
00:10:14.882 --> 00:10:19.320
by tacking on a -start and a -end into the grid area.

238
00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:21.107
So, in here, what I've done, is I've said,

239
00:10:21.107 --> 00:10:23.741
start where the poop starts,

240
00:10:23.741 --> 00:10:26.836
and end where the poop ends, right?

241
00:10:26.836 --> 00:10:29.250
I could also do something like this,

242
00:10:29.250 --> 00:10:32.407
where hamburger-end, and give that a save,

243
00:10:32.407 --> 00:10:35.045
and you could see, it starts where the poop area starts,

244
00:10:35.045 --> 00:10:37.135
and ends where the poop area ends.

245
00:10:37.135 --> 00:10:41.289
And similarly, if I went to the grid row,

246
00:10:41.289 --> 00:10:43.555
I could just say grid-row-end,

247
00:10:43.555 --> 00:10:46.888
if I only wanna end where the poop ends,

248
00:10:49.211 --> 00:10:50.460
then it's going to move it down.

249
00:10:50.460 --> 00:10:51.293
Why?

250
00:10:51.293 --> 00:10:52.727
Because it is going to anchor it

251
00:10:52.727 --> 00:10:54.802
at the bottom of our poop area,

252
00:10:54.802 --> 00:10:57.056
and of course, it will spill into the hamburger area,

253
00:10:57.056 --> 00:11:00.262
because of how wide that actual columns have gone.

254
00:11:00.262 --> 00:11:02.556
So, you don't always have to use line numbers.

255
00:11:02.556 --> 00:11:05.605
You can also use areas that you have created

256
00:11:05.605 --> 00:11:07.530
in your grid template areas,

257
00:11:07.530 --> 00:11:09.669
by using the, sort of,

258
00:11:09.669 --> 00:11:12.394
implicit lines that come along for free,

259
00:11:12.394 --> 00:11:14.301
by using -start and -end,

260
00:11:14.301 --> 00:11:18.153
tacked on to whatever you named your grid template area.

261
00:11:18.153 --> 00:11:20.623 line:15% 
(hard rock music)
