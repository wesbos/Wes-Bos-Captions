(rock music)

2
00:00:03.006 --> 00:00:05.348
<v Wes>Alright let's make a responsive website.</v>

3
00:00:05.348 --> 00:00:07.576
This thing is a little bit flashy

4
00:00:07.576 --> 00:00:09.697
with all the pink and yellow, but

5
00:00:09.697 --> 00:00:11.574
please bear with the design.

6
00:00:11.574 --> 00:00:13.742
So what we're gonna be doing here is we've got

7
00:00:13.742 --> 00:00:16.508
our standard website and it's got a number

8
00:00:16.508 --> 00:00:17.534
of different sections.

9
00:00:17.534 --> 00:00:19.065
We have the sort of hero image here.

10
00:00:19.065 --> 00:00:22.703
We've got these calls to action with some sales.

11
00:00:22.703 --> 00:00:24.853
We have a responsive navigation that's happening.

12
00:00:24.853 --> 00:00:27.288
We've got your standard columns with your features.

13
00:00:27.288 --> 00:00:30.417
We got about, or featured taco spot here.

14
00:00:30.417 --> 00:00:33.629
And then a little spot for your Instagrams at the bottom.

15
00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:35.752
And as I resize this,

16
00:00:35.752 --> 00:00:37.995
well first of all the menu is gonna move from being

17
00:00:37.995 --> 00:00:41.544
right here to when you get maybe a sort of mobile size,

18
00:00:41.544 --> 00:00:44.564
it's gonna move up top and be able to open it and close that

19
00:00:44.564 --> 00:00:46.120
with a little bit of JavaScript.

20
00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.039
And then as you get smaller, you'll see that these

21
00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:53.904
features right here will automatically resize themselves

22
00:00:53.904 --> 00:00:55.737
but the top value here

23
00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:58.858
is going to rearrange itself

24
00:00:58.858 --> 00:01:02.271
to sort of one by two, and then eventually

25
00:01:02.271 --> 00:01:04.088
we're gonna put those two underneath,

26
00:01:04.088 --> 00:01:05.507
and then at a certain point,

27
00:01:05.507 --> 00:01:07.344
everything will go down to one column

28
00:01:07.344 --> 00:01:10.831
'cause we're sort of on mobile for that value.

29
00:01:10.831 --> 00:01:13.273
So let's get started here.

30
00:01:13.273 --> 00:01:15.008
Open up this responsive,

31
00:01:15.008 --> 00:01:16.658
we've got all the different sections here.

32
00:01:16.658 --> 00:01:18.568
So we've got top, we've got menu,

33
00:01:18.568 --> 00:01:22.144
we've got features, we've got about, and we have galleries.

34
00:01:22.144 --> 00:01:24.090
So those are sort of the five pieces

35
00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.882
that are all direct descendants

36
00:01:25.882 --> 00:01:27.927
of this wrapper element here.

37
00:01:27.927 --> 00:01:30.087
And then if we open up responsive start,

38
00:01:30.087 --> 00:01:32.473
this is where we're working right here.

39
00:01:32.473 --> 00:01:34.994
I also have responsive-START.css

40
00:01:34.994 --> 00:01:36.511
and this doesn't have much in it,

41
00:01:36.511 --> 00:01:39.576
we do have that base styling which gives us this background,

42
00:01:39.576 --> 00:01:41.460
but I've just bumped up the font size,

43
00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.472
I've styled the button already,

44
00:01:43.472 --> 00:01:45.088
and I put a max-width on our images

45
00:01:45.088 --> 00:01:47.526
so they don't spill outside of any of our containers

46
00:01:47.526 --> 00:01:49.280
that we have.
Good, so

47
00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.180
let's start from top down,

48
00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.495
we'll start with the top section.

49
00:01:53.495 --> 00:01:56.820
And I also want you to open up your dev tools,

50
00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.034
just so we can see exactly what's going on here.

51
00:01:59.034 --> 00:02:01.248
So I'm gonna go to layout, and there's no grids yet,

52
00:02:01.248 --> 00:02:04.172
but if we display grid on this sucker,

53
00:02:04.172 --> 00:02:06.838
it's gonna show up and we'll turn that on.

54
00:02:06.838 --> 00:02:10.022
And I want them to look a little bit something like this.

55
00:02:10.022 --> 00:02:12.180
Now instead of actually defining the columns here,

56
00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.303
I'm going to use grid template areas where we can name them

57
00:02:15.303 --> 00:02:18.337
and that's gonna be really handy when we get to responsive

58
00:02:18.337 --> 00:02:21.498
'cause we can just rearrange the actual grid.

59
00:02:21.498 --> 00:02:24.845
So let's say grid-template-areas,

60
00:02:24.845 --> 00:02:27.286
and I want them to be,

61
00:02:27.286 --> 00:02:30.703
it's gonna look like this.
hero hero cta1.

62
00:02:33.149 --> 00:02:36.418
And then the next one is hero hero cta2.

63
00:02:36.418 --> 00:02:39.482
And that should put them sort of side-by-side,

64
00:02:39.482 --> 00:02:41.068
hero's gonna take up two heights

65
00:02:41.068 --> 00:02:45.398
and the cta1 and cta2 are gonna take up their value.

66
00:02:45.398 --> 00:02:47.030
So it doesn't look great here,

67
00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:49.248
that's because we need to go ahead and select them now.

68
00:02:49.248 --> 00:02:53.165
So the hero is just going to be grid-area: hero

69
00:02:55.065 --> 00:02:57.832
and there we go, see it's starting to look a little nicer.

70
00:02:57.832 --> 00:03:00.115
And these will automatically fall into place,

71
00:03:00.115 --> 00:03:02.058
but let's explicitly place them.

72
00:03:02.058 --> 00:03:05.558
So cta1 is going to be the grid-area: cta1

73
00:03:07.642 --> 00:03:11.534
and obviously the next one's gonna be two.

74
00:03:11.534 --> 00:03:13.170
Good, and that won't change anything

75
00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:14.950
but we can see them showing up.

76
00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:19.355
Let's go and style this hero value that we have here.

77
00:03:19.355 --> 00:03:21.933
So we'll select that hero,

78
00:03:21.933 --> 00:03:23.285
actually didn't we already select it?

79
00:03:23.285 --> 00:03:25.503
We did, right here.

80
00:03:25.503 --> 00:03:29.420
So we're gonna put a min-height on it of 400px.

81
00:03:31.461 --> 00:03:32.294
Beautiful.

82
00:03:33.514 --> 00:03:37.470
We're going to put a background on it of white,

83
00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:41.637
and we're going to use a url images forward slash taco.jpg.

84
00:03:42.528 --> 00:03:46.382
Looking good, background-size: cover.

85
00:03:46.382 --> 00:03:47.215
Beautiful.

86
00:03:48.119 --> 00:03:52.051
We'll background-position it into the bottom right,

87
00:03:52.051 --> 00:03:54.346
so we'll sort of anchor it off of that taco,

88
00:03:54.346 --> 00:03:56.605
so if we get a lot bigger, that taco image

89
00:03:56.605 --> 00:03:59.628
is gonna anchor itself in the bottom right hand corner.

90
00:03:59.628 --> 00:04:03.694
And we'll put a little bit of padding on that as well.

91
00:04:03.694 --> 00:04:06.490
Beautiful, now let's work with this text here.

92
00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:08.988
I want to get it to look like this,

93
00:04:08.988 --> 00:04:12.245
where it's actually in the middle, to the right.

94
00:04:12.245 --> 00:04:14.614
And I had initially done this with grid,

95
00:04:14.614 --> 00:04:18.009
but this is actually a perfect use case for flexbox.

96
00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:19.319
So let me show you here,

97
00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:22.152
let's first grab those hero items,

98
00:04:23.437 --> 00:04:27.604
and we'll put a background color, which is a yellow.

99
00:04:30.636 --> 00:04:35.155
Good, and the design I want is just want them to be

100
00:04:35.155 --> 00:04:37.596
as wide as the text is, right.

101
00:04:37.596 --> 00:04:40.600
But the problem is that they are grid items,

102
00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:42.444
they're not inside of a wrapper,

103
00:04:42.444 --> 00:04:44.258
they are themselves grid items.

104
00:04:44.258 --> 00:04:46.317
So if we look at the HTML here,

105
00:04:46.317 --> 00:04:49.635
you'll see that our grid would be the hero,

106
00:04:49.635 --> 00:04:51.169
we would display grid on that,

107
00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:52.930
and then the H1 and the paragraph tag

108
00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:54.379
are gonna be our grid items.

109
00:04:54.379 --> 00:04:56.848
So let's actually try to do that.

110
00:04:56.848 --> 00:04:58.623
So let's go back to our hero,

111
00:04:58.623 --> 00:05:01.223
and we'll say display: grid

112
00:05:01.223 --> 00:05:03.973
and with justify-content: center.

113
00:05:05.641 --> 00:05:09.152
Oh, well, actually start.
Beautiful.

114
00:05:09.152 --> 00:05:11.319
And align-content: center.

115
00:05:14.305 --> 00:05:16.297
That puts them right where I want them.

116
00:05:16.297 --> 00:05:20.515
The problem is that because it's column-based,

117
00:05:20.515 --> 00:05:23.451
if we take it off the top and turn on the header,

118
00:05:23.451 --> 00:05:26.346
the columns are just gonna be as wide as the longest one

119
00:05:26.346 --> 00:05:30.223
and I want this yellow to stop exactly right here.

120
00:05:30.223 --> 00:05:32.789
And that's just how it works,

121
00:05:32.789 --> 00:05:36.180
one column is always going to be as wide as the other.

122
00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:38.782
So this is the perfect use case, instead of using grid,

123
00:05:38.782 --> 00:05:42.022
we're gonna display: flex on that item.

124
00:05:42.022 --> 00:05:45.056
We're going to say flex-direction: column,

125
00:05:45.056 --> 00:05:46.673
so they go top to bottom.

126
00:05:46.673 --> 00:05:49.673
And we'll say justify-items: center,

127
00:05:51.326 --> 00:05:52.844
No?
Let me take these off.

128
00:05:52.844 --> 00:05:55.286
I really don't know what they do, I just try.

129
00:05:55.286 --> 00:05:57.608
Align-items: center? No.

130
00:05:57.608 --> 00:06:00.441
Align-items: start? Or flex-start?

131
00:06:01.493 --> 00:06:03.910
And justify-items: center.
No.

132
00:06:05.543 --> 00:06:08.785
Justify-content: center.
There we go.

133
00:06:08.785 --> 00:06:13.093
That's exactly what I want, I put a little bit of padding,

134
00:06:13.093 --> 00:06:15.885
5px on those, beautiful.
That's exactly what we want,

135
00:06:15.885 --> 00:06:19.376
and that's a good use case for using flexbox over CSS grid

136
00:06:19.376 --> 00:06:21.904
when you want each of them to be a variable width.

137
00:06:21.904 --> 00:06:25.092
Now let's go onto these call to action values here.

138
00:06:25.092 --> 00:06:28.958
So say anything with a class of call to action on it,

139
00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:33.070
background is going to be that yellow that we like to use.

140
00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:35.320
Beautiful, put a little bit

141
00:06:36.182 --> 00:06:40.727
on our top value, we'll put a grid gap of 20px on it

142
00:06:40.727 --> 00:06:44.852
so they're not butting up totally against each other.

143
00:06:44.852 --> 00:06:46.790
Now I wanna perfectly center all of the text

144
00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:49.264
right inside of here, so we'll go back down

145
00:06:49.264 --> 00:06:53.295
to our cta and and we'll display: grid right on those.

146
00:06:53.295 --> 00:06:57.462
So we'll say align-items: center and justify-items: center,

147
00:06:58.654 --> 00:07:00.328
and that will center them for us.

148
00:07:00.328 --> 00:07:01.230
Alternatively we could've just said

149
00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:03.671
place items center center,

150
00:07:03.671 --> 00:07:07.165
and there's a little bit, let's turn on the grid

151
00:07:07.165 --> 00:07:07.998
for one of these.

152
00:07:07.998 --> 00:07:11.666
You see that they are stretching to whatever the height is,

153
00:07:11.666 --> 00:07:15.296
and in this value I want them to suctioned

154
00:07:15.296 --> 00:07:17.506
into the actual middle.

155
00:07:17.506 --> 00:07:21.173
So for that we are going to justify-content,

156
00:07:22.612 --> 00:07:25.529
or no sorry, align-content: center,

157
00:07:26.773 --> 00:07:29.254
and that will put them right in the middle.

158
00:07:29.254 --> 00:07:31.105
There is a little bit of margin on them,

159
00:07:31.105 --> 00:07:33.236
so we'll say cta p, margin: 0,

160
00:07:33.236 --> 00:07:34.409
and that will get rid of them.

161
00:07:34.409 --> 00:07:37.678
See how I like to have them just right bang in the middle

162
00:07:37.678 --> 00:07:42.243
regardless of how high the value is available to us.

163
00:07:42.243 --> 00:07:43.948
So that's a good use case for that.

164
00:07:43.948 --> 00:07:46.670
I'm going to take the price,

165
00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:48.899
so sorry I'll put this down here,

166
00:07:48.899 --> 00:07:52.899
anything with a class of price, font-size: 60px.

167
00:07:53.869 --> 00:07:55.666
Beautiful, and then we'll just put

168
00:07:55.666 --> 00:07:57.808
font-weight of 300 on that.

169
00:07:57.808 --> 00:07:58.962
Good, that's looking good.

170
00:07:58.962 --> 00:08:00.741
That whole top value is done for us,

171
00:08:00.741 --> 00:08:03.841
let's move on to doing the navigation.

172
00:08:03.841 --> 00:08:07.258
So we'll go ahead and select the menu ul,

173
00:08:09.219 --> 00:08:11.974
and we want all these items here,

174
00:08:11.974 --> 00:08:13.613
the tacos, beer, wine, dessert,

175
00:08:13.613 --> 00:08:16.840
we want them to take up as much space as they can

176
00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:18.665
and that's a good use for our minmax.

177
00:08:18.665 --> 00:08:21.809
So we'll say grid-template-columns,

178
00:08:21.809 --> 00:08:23.892
repeat, auto-fit, minmax.

179
00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:29.410
We want the minimum to be 100px,

180
00:08:29.410 --> 00:08:31.900
the maximum to be 1fr.

181
00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:33.574
So let's see where that gets us.

182
00:08:33.574 --> 00:08:37.657
Nowhere, because I did not display: grid on that.

183
00:08:38.540 --> 00:08:42.707
Awesome, looking good, we can take off all of the padding,

184
00:08:44.334 --> 00:08:47.584
margin, and we can say list-style: none

185
00:08:48.842 --> 00:08:51.361
and that will get rid of the dots that we have there.

186
00:08:51.361 --> 00:08:53.629
And then instead of styling the li's,

187
00:08:53.629 --> 00:08:56.058
we're actually going to style the links.

188
00:08:56.058 --> 00:08:57.808
So we'll say .menu a,

189
00:08:58.691 --> 00:09:02.108
background the yellow value that we like.

190
00:09:04.212 --> 00:09:06.122
Now what's going on which each of these?

191
00:09:06.122 --> 00:09:08.316
Why are they not spreading all the way across?

192
00:09:08.316 --> 00:09:10.876
Well, display: block on those links

193
00:09:10.876 --> 00:09:11.709
and they'll go all the way across,

194
00:09:11.709 --> 00:09:13.203
because by default links are inline,

195
00:09:13.203 --> 00:09:14.982
and they just go as wide as they need to be

196
00:09:14.982 --> 00:09:16.393
but we want them to be block

197
00:09:16.393 --> 00:09:18.241
and they'll take up all the space we have.

198
00:09:18.241 --> 00:09:20.689
Text-decoration: none.

199
00:09:20.689 --> 00:09:22.380
Padding: 10px.

200
00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:24.748
Text-align: center.

201
00:09:24.748 --> 00:09:28.415
Color, that black color that we like to use.

202
00:09:30.204 --> 00:09:33.481
Looking pretty good, maybe text-transform: uppercase.

203
00:09:33.481 --> 00:09:36.293
I like it.
Bump up the font size

204
00:09:36.293 --> 00:09:38.464
a little bit as well.

205
00:09:38.464 --> 00:09:40.318
Good, so that is all of our values there,

206
00:09:40.318 --> 00:09:42.601
we'll go back up to this grid and say,

207
00:09:42.601 --> 00:09:45.737
we'll put some gap on it, maybe 10px.

208
00:09:45.737 --> 00:09:49.210
Looking good, and we'll also put some margin

209
00:09:49.210 --> 00:09:53.251
on the top of each, on the top and bottom of it.

210
00:09:53.251 --> 00:09:55.293
Alright, tacos, beers, wines, desserts.

211
00:09:55.293 --> 00:09:56.951
I'm pretty happy with that.

212
00:09:56.951 --> 00:10:00.065
Now let's, while we're focused on this,

213
00:10:00.065 --> 00:10:02.814
let's hide this menu button.

214
00:10:02.814 --> 00:10:07.257
So I'm just gonna go over to my inspector here,

215
00:10:07.257 --> 00:10:09.007
go over to the rules.

216
00:10:11.919 --> 00:10:14.424
And I'm actually using aria attributes here

217
00:10:14.424 --> 00:10:18.023
to hide and show the button, rather than a bunch of classes.

218
00:10:18.023 --> 00:10:19.913
So aria controls menu-list,

219
00:10:19.913 --> 00:10:22.073
we're just gonna totally hide that button

220
00:10:22.073 --> 00:10:24.703
and then we're gonna control the open and state close

221
00:10:24.703 --> 00:10:26.459
with this aria-expanded attribute.

222
00:10:26.459 --> 00:10:31.334
So go down here, and we'll say aria-controls menu-list,

223
00:10:31.334 --> 00:10:33.753
that's an attribute selector in CSS.

224
00:10:33.753 --> 00:10:37.491
So based on the attribute being aria-controls menu-list,

225
00:10:37.491 --> 00:10:40.687
display: none, and that will then hide it.

226
00:10:40.687 --> 00:10:41.795
And then we'll come back to that

227
00:10:41.795 --> 00:10:44.195
when we hit our media queries in order to show it

228
00:10:44.195 --> 00:10:47.101
and move this up top and a bunch of other stuff.

229
00:10:47.101 --> 00:10:50.696
Good, let's move over to the features section here.

230
00:10:50.696 --> 00:10:54.171
And inside of the feature we have a bunch of features.

231
00:10:54.171 --> 00:10:57.588
So features is going to be display: grid,

232
00:10:59.710 --> 00:11:03.287
and then the grid-template-columns is going to be,

233
00:11:03.287 --> 00:11:06.954
let's do our whole repeat, auto-fit, minmax,

234
00:11:09.757 --> 00:11:12.507
minimum of 200px, maximum of 1fr.

235
00:11:15.319 --> 00:11:17.397
Let's give that a save.
See, looking good.

236
00:11:17.397 --> 00:11:20.060
Let's actually style each feature and then we can see

237
00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:21.233
if it's actually responsive.

238
00:11:21.233 --> 00:11:25.247
So feature, background, let's just do white for now,

239
00:11:25.247 --> 00:11:26.782
we'll come back to that in a second.

240
00:11:26.782 --> 00:11:27.949
Padding: 10px.

241
00:11:29.020 --> 00:11:31.020
Border: 1px solid white.

242
00:11:35.329 --> 00:11:37.246
And text-align: center,

243
00:11:39.636 --> 00:11:43.803
and box-shadow: 0 0 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.1).

244
00:11:47.876 --> 00:11:49.242
Looking good, we'll go back up to our features

245
00:11:49.242 --> 00:11:52.575
and put some gap on that.
grid-gap: 20px.

246
00:11:53.973 --> 00:11:57.209
Now this should be responsive by nature

247
00:11:57.209 --> 00:12:00.047
because we've used this auto-fit minmax deal

248
00:12:00.047 --> 00:12:02.271
that we like to use, so as I resize,

249
00:12:02.271 --> 00:12:04.771
as I get smaller, there we go.

250
00:12:05.723 --> 00:12:08.499
It goes all the way down to one column.

251
00:12:08.499 --> 00:12:10.444
We can play with these icons as well,

252
00:12:10.444 --> 00:12:13.194
so feature icon, font-size: 50px,

253
00:12:15.901 --> 00:12:17.818
and looking good to me.

254
00:12:19.710 --> 00:12:23.377
Maybe I'll make this text a little bit gray.

255
00:12:27.684 --> 00:12:29.047
Good!
That's looking good to me.

256
00:12:29.047 --> 00:12:31.184
Let's move onto this about section,

257
00:12:31.184 --> 00:12:33.201
which has the featured taco.

258
00:12:33.201 --> 00:12:36.534
About, background: white, padding: 50px.

259
00:12:40.631 --> 00:12:43.131
We'll make it a display: grid.

260
00:12:44.749 --> 00:12:47.590
And I want this image to be 400px wide

261
00:12:47.590 --> 00:12:50.095
and then the rest of the text, the rest of the space

262
00:12:50.095 --> 00:12:51.785
will be reserved for the text.

263
00:12:51.785 --> 00:12:55.509
So let's do the first column 400px and the rest 1fr,

264
00:12:55.509 --> 00:12:57.542
and that should put everything right side-by-side.

265
00:12:57.542 --> 00:12:59.742
Now I wanna vertically center everything,

266
00:12:59.742 --> 00:13:03.368
so align-items: center, and that will

267
00:13:03.368 --> 00:13:04.611
vertically center everything else.

268
00:13:04.611 --> 00:13:06.205
I could also horizontally center it,

269
00:13:06.205 --> 00:13:09.523
but because of how this works it wouldn't do any different.

270
00:13:09.523 --> 00:13:10.977
That's looking pretty good,

271
00:13:10.977 --> 00:13:14.820
it's just bumped up a bit so I'll say margin: 0.

272
00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:16.135
Actually, you know what we can do,

273
00:13:16.135 --> 00:13:17.325
instead of having to put margin

274
00:13:17.325 --> 00:13:21.492
on every single one of these things, if I go to my menu,

275
00:13:22.519 --> 00:13:24.662
you know how I put margin on that as well?

276
00:13:24.662 --> 00:13:29.240
All of this stuff is all bumping up against each other.

277
00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:32.214
What we can do is we can make our wrapper,

278
00:13:32.214 --> 00:13:36.047
let's go above the top and select our wrapper.

279
00:13:37.674 --> 00:13:39.458
And that's gonna be display: grid.

280
00:13:39.458 --> 00:13:42.486
We're not going to actually put any columns in it,

281
00:13:42.486 --> 00:13:45.304
but what that's going to do is it's going to allow us

282
00:13:45.304 --> 00:13:48.304
to do something like grid-gap: 20px,

283
00:13:49.450 --> 00:13:51.540
and then every single one of the items,

284
00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:53.790
if we look at our DOM here,

285
00:13:54.807 --> 00:13:57.301
the DOM, this is our wrapper, we have top,

286
00:13:57.301 --> 00:13:59.696
we have menu, we have features, we have about,

287
00:13:59.696 --> 00:14:00.529
and we have gallery.

288
00:14:00.529 --> 00:14:04.974
All of those items are now going to be spaced 20px apart,

289
00:14:04.974 --> 00:14:06.081
and I don't have to worry about doing

290
00:14:06.081 --> 00:14:08.435
margin-top or margin-bottom on any of these items.

291
00:14:08.435 --> 00:14:11.155
This is also going to allow us to use the order property

292
00:14:11.155 --> 00:14:14.238
to put the menu above the top section

293
00:14:16.158 --> 00:14:18.924
when we hit a certain breakpoint.

294
00:14:18.924 --> 00:14:21.346
So let's finish up the rest of the site down here.

295
00:14:21.346 --> 00:14:23.963
We did the about, let's look at the Instant Grams.

296
00:14:23.963 --> 00:14:25.443
So we'll go to the bottom here.

297
00:14:25.443 --> 00:14:29.418
Gallery, I wanna display: grid on the gallery itself,

298
00:14:29.418 --> 00:14:33.938
and I want them to be 200px minimum, 1fr maximum.

299
00:14:33.938 --> 00:14:38.570
So say let's display, grid-template-columns: repeat,

300
00:14:38.570 --> 00:14:43.371
auto-fit, see how we use this a lot in the real world?

301
00:14:43.371 --> 00:14:44.204
auto, 1fr.

302
00:14:46.469 --> 00:14:47.386
200px, 1fr.

303
00:14:50.850 --> 00:14:55.017
Looking good-ish, so what I did to show you what's,

304
00:14:56.042 --> 00:14:59.306
to have each and every one of them be a different photo,

305
00:14:59.306 --> 00:15:03.059
is I actually made them all a little bit different sizes.

306
00:15:03.059 --> 00:15:05.592
They start at 201 and go up to 210,

307
00:15:05.592 --> 00:15:08.355
so now that's looking kinda funky so we have to a little bit

308
00:15:08.355 --> 00:15:11.766
of CSS to slightly adjust those.

309
00:15:11.766 --> 00:15:14.683
So grid-gap: 20px on each of those.

310
00:15:15.526 --> 00:15:19.109
And I'll say gallery img, width: 100%.

311
00:15:21.921 --> 00:15:23.812
Now it's looking a little bit nicer for us,

312
00:15:23.812 --> 00:15:27.404
but I want this H2 to go all the way across.

313
00:15:27.404 --> 00:15:30.507
You see how the H2 is going to be a grid item,

314
00:15:30.507 --> 00:15:32.939
as if the gallery is a grid?

315
00:15:32.939 --> 00:15:35.703
So what we're gonna do is we're gonna select that H2

316
00:15:35.703 --> 00:15:38.249
and make it span all the way across.

317
00:15:38.249 --> 00:15:40.925
Start at one, go to the end.

318
00:15:40.925 --> 00:15:42.589
Bam, looking good.

319
00:15:42.589 --> 00:15:45.262
But, let's do this pretty snazzy,

320
00:15:45.262 --> 00:15:49.429
look at this Instant Grams snazzy scroll in and scroll out.

321
00:15:50.900 --> 00:15:52.250
So what we're gonna do is we're actually

322
00:15:52.250 --> 00:15:54.136
going to make this H2.

323
00:15:54.136 --> 00:15:57.023
Let's actually move this below the image

324
00:15:57.023 --> 00:15:59.503
for my sanity's sake.

325
00:15:59.503 --> 00:16:02.251
Oh my gosh, I turn off my auto-formatting

326
00:16:02.251 --> 00:16:06.092
because it screws up the grid template areas

327
00:16:06.092 --> 00:16:09.527
and then when I screw up the rest of it,

328
00:16:09.527 --> 00:16:12.861
(laughs) I'm all goofed up.

329
00:16:12.861 --> 00:16:15.007
So we have a H2, which is a grid item,

330
00:16:15.007 --> 00:16:17.693
but we'll also display: grid on that.

331
00:16:17.693 --> 00:16:19.633
Now, you might be saying Wes,

332
00:16:19.633 --> 00:16:23.132
what are the grid items on an H2?

333
00:16:23.132 --> 00:16:24.938
Well, we're actually going to be using

334
00:16:24.938 --> 00:16:28.213
a before and after attribute for these kind of

335
00:16:28.213 --> 00:16:31.139
these yellow bars that go to the right and to the left.

336
00:16:31.139 --> 00:16:34.472
And what's neat is that before and after

337
00:16:35.503 --> 00:16:37.971
they are considered grid items, just along with

338
00:16:37.971 --> 00:16:40.497
the actual content inside of the H2.

339
00:16:40.497 --> 00:16:44.898
So we're going to make some items that go to the left

340
00:16:44.898 --> 00:16:48.750
and to the right of this H2 tag here.

341
00:16:48.750 --> 00:16:51.176
So we'll say gallery h2:before,

342
00:16:51.176 --> 00:16:52.926
and gallery h2:after.

343
00:16:57.472 --> 00:17:00.055
We will display: block on them.

344
00:17:01.821 --> 00:17:05.218
Content set to nothing, so that they're actually items.

345
00:17:05.218 --> 00:17:07.548
Height of 10px, and the background,

346
00:17:07.548 --> 00:17:10.257
let's just do a background of yellow for now,

347
00:17:10.257 --> 00:17:11.791
we're gonna change it to a gradient in just a second.

348
00:17:11.791 --> 00:17:13.516
So I've got, look it, I've got these bars

349
00:17:13.516 --> 00:17:17.516
these are before and after bars that show up.

350
00:17:17.516 --> 00:17:19.933
If I were to inspect element,

351
00:17:21.129 --> 00:17:25.296
you'll see that my H2 has a before, a text, and an after.

352
00:17:26.826 --> 00:17:30.540
And these three things are going to be our grid items.

353
00:17:30.540 --> 00:17:32.789
Now I want the text to be in the middle,

354
00:17:32.789 --> 00:17:33.879
and then I want the before and after

355
00:17:33.879 --> 00:17:36.345
to split whatever is left.

356
00:17:36.345 --> 00:17:38.287
So we can go to this H2 and we can say

357
00:17:38.287 --> 00:17:41.204
grid-template-columns: 1fr auto 1fr

358
00:17:43.501 --> 00:17:45.486
and that will immediately just put them

359
00:17:45.486 --> 00:17:46.882
right next to each other,

360
00:17:46.882 --> 00:17:49.144
and now that's kinda butting up a little bit close

361
00:17:49.144 --> 00:17:52.568
so we can use some grid-gap for that.

362
00:17:52.568 --> 00:17:56.064
Looking good, and then if I want to vertically center them,

363
00:17:56.064 --> 00:17:58.147
we use align-items and that will put them

364
00:17:58.147 --> 00:17:59.475
to the left and to the right.

365
00:17:59.475 --> 00:18:03.012
Now I want them to be gradients, not this background color.

366
00:18:03.012 --> 00:18:06.345
So I'll say background: linear-gradient,

367
00:18:08.221 --> 00:18:12.304
and we say to left, and then our variable yellow.

368
00:18:14.806 --> 00:18:18.521
And we want it to go to transparent.

369
00:18:18.521 --> 00:18:20.441
So the way that gradients work is that you tell it

370
00:18:20.441 --> 00:18:23.311
the direction, what you want it to start at,

371
00:18:23.311 --> 00:18:24.583
and what you want to stop at.

372
00:18:24.583 --> 00:18:26.406
You can put multiple stops in there,

373
00:18:26.406 --> 00:18:28.371
but this is just a very simple start stop,

374
00:18:28.371 --> 00:18:30.062
figure it out in between.

375
00:18:30.062 --> 00:18:32.059
And that will put it from left to right.

376
00:18:32.059 --> 00:18:33.637
Now the problem is that the after

377
00:18:33.637 --> 00:18:36.687
needs to be flipped around, needs to be to right.

378
00:18:36.687 --> 00:18:39.370
So what I can do is just select that again,

379
00:18:39.370 --> 00:18:41.745
and just duplicate it.

380
00:18:41.745 --> 00:18:44.662
And then change that left to right,

381
00:18:46.367 --> 00:18:48.153
and we can call it a day.

382
00:18:48.153 --> 00:18:51.200
But what is also cool about this is we could change this

383
00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:55.367
to be a variable var, and we could make a direction variable

384
00:18:57.591 --> 00:19:01.001
and fall back to the default left if it's not there.

385
00:19:01.001 --> 00:19:02.918
And let me remove this.

386
00:19:03.972 --> 00:19:05.466
So that's back where we were.

387
00:19:05.466 --> 00:19:07.133
And then on the after, all we have to do

388
00:19:07.133 --> 00:19:10.716
is set that variable direction to be right.

389
00:19:11.613 --> 00:19:13.986
And then it will flip that value,

390
00:19:13.986 --> 00:19:16.545
because it will overwrite it, it comes after this.

391
00:19:16.545 --> 00:19:18.032
And we've got this nice little thing.

392
00:19:18.032 --> 00:19:20.467
You can also do this pretty simply in flexbox as well,

393
00:19:20.467 --> 00:19:23.602
but it doesn't really matter all that much.

394
00:19:23.602 --> 00:19:26.378
Alright let's start working on some of the responsive stuff.

395
00:19:26.378 --> 00:19:27.813
So we'll do it top to bottom, we'll start with

396
00:19:27.813 --> 00:19:30.657
this top section in here where, if you remember,

397
00:19:30.657 --> 00:19:33.158
we did hero hero call to action one,

398
00:19:33.158 --> 00:19:35.544
hero hero call to action two.

399
00:19:35.544 --> 00:19:38.568
And what I wanna do is as we get smaller,

400
00:19:38.568 --> 00:19:43.083
I want to put the $1.99 and $3.99 underneath it

401
00:19:43.083 --> 00:19:46.725
and let this picture span all the way across.

402
00:19:46.725 --> 00:19:48.253
So we'll go down to the bottom here,

403
00:19:48.253 --> 00:19:52.420
give ourselves a media query, so we'll do max-width: 700px,

404
00:19:55.017 --> 00:19:57.829
and I'll say the top value, and all we have to do here

405
00:19:57.829 --> 00:20:00.429
is just redefine what the layout looks like.

406
00:20:00.429 --> 00:20:04.091
So we'll say grid-template-areas, and the value

407
00:20:04.091 --> 00:20:06.758
is going to simply be hero hero,

408
00:20:07.667 --> 00:20:09.167
and cta1 and cta2.

409
00:20:10.955 --> 00:20:14.262
And because the values are already assigned to hero area,

410
00:20:14.262 --> 00:20:18.429
cta1 area, and cta2 area, it should just automatically

411
00:20:19.569 --> 00:20:21.742
change 'em up.
So we'll go over

412
00:20:21.742 --> 00:20:25.032
to our inspector here, and as I resize,

413
00:20:25.032 --> 00:20:28.032
let's actually turn on the grid inspector first.

414
00:20:28.032 --> 00:20:31.510
See cta1, cta2, and as we hit that value

415
00:20:31.510 --> 00:20:34.118
they go below each other and we just re-layout

416
00:20:34.118 --> 00:20:35.772
what that value looks like.

417
00:20:35.772 --> 00:20:38.428
We'll do one more, just copy paste this media query

418
00:20:38.428 --> 00:20:41.780
and when we hit 500px, we're just gonna bring it down

419
00:20:41.780 --> 00:20:45.091
to one column and all we need to do now is just say

420
00:20:45.091 --> 00:20:49.258
hero, and then the next line cta1, and the next line cta2.

421
00:20:51.417 --> 00:20:53.707
Now that should do it.

422
00:20:53.707 --> 00:20:55.533
Bup, bup, bup!
There we go,

423
00:20:55.533 --> 00:20:57.939
looking really good, it's still currently

424
00:20:57.939 --> 00:21:00.249
scrolling horizontal because of some other stuff

425
00:21:00.249 --> 00:21:01.474
that we have on the page,

426
00:21:01.474 --> 00:21:03.983
that will be fixed as we go through the website.

427
00:21:03.983 --> 00:21:06.159
So that's good, let's go onto the next one

428
00:21:06.159 --> 00:21:08.745
which is the responsive menu.

429
00:21:08.745 --> 00:21:10.821
The first thing I actually want to do is

430
00:21:10.821 --> 00:21:15.740
once we hit 1000px media query, we're going to move

431
00:21:15.740 --> 00:21:19.612
the menu above the actual top thing that we have here.

432
00:21:19.612 --> 00:21:23.066
So I'm gonna duplicate this media query.

433
00:21:23.066 --> 00:21:26.066
And we're gonna switch it to 1000px.

434
00:21:27.504 --> 00:21:31.671
And I'm going to take the menu, and I say order: -1

435
00:21:32.704 --> 00:21:34.240
and what that should do is,

436
00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:37.418
because menu is a direct descendant of our wrapper,

437
00:21:37.418 --> 00:21:41.251
and because our wrapper is already display: grid-ed-ed,

438
00:21:41.251 --> 00:21:43.969
by putting it order: -1, and there it is,

439
00:21:43.969 --> 00:21:47.799
it put it above the actual top instead of in between

440
00:21:47.799 --> 00:21:51.156
so we've reordered the actual values that we have there.

441
00:21:51.156 --> 00:21:55.073
At that point, we also want to show the button,

442
00:21:56.162 --> 00:21:59.201
so what was the button that we had earlier,

443
00:21:59.201 --> 00:22:01.975
it was the aria-controls menu-list,

444
00:22:01.975 --> 00:22:05.309
so I'm gonna grab that selector, paste that in there.

445
00:22:05.309 --> 00:22:08.077
We're going to display: block,

446
00:22:08.077 --> 00:22:11.089
and put some margin-bottom on the bottom there.

447
00:22:11.089 --> 00:22:15.482
So that's our menu that we have showing up.

448
00:22:15.482 --> 00:22:18.560
Now because this is my mobile value,

449
00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:21.177
I want to hide the actual ul.

450
00:22:21.177 --> 00:22:24.517
So the way I'm going to do that

451
00:22:24.517 --> 00:22:27.100
is to select the menu, .menu ul

452
00:22:31.077 --> 00:22:34.063
then I say max-height: 0 and the reason why,

453
00:22:34.063 --> 00:22:36.726
this will become apparent why I'm doing this

454
00:22:36.726 --> 00:22:38.143
in just a second.

455
00:22:39.417 --> 00:22:43.584
And I'm going to transform it by rotating X 90 degrees.

456
00:22:47.729 --> 00:22:50.997
And what that actually does is it hides the menu for us,

457
00:22:50.997 --> 00:22:53.393
it has just rotated it up.

458
00:22:53.393 --> 00:22:55.390
And I'm gonna show you how when we click this button

459
00:22:55.390 --> 00:22:57.681
in just a second it's going to hide and show

460
00:22:57.681 --> 00:22:59.240
the different values that we want.

461
00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:03.672
I'm also gonna put a transition on it of 0.5 seconds.

462
00:23:03.672 --> 00:23:06.089
Transition: all, 0.5 seconds.

463
00:23:08.050 --> 00:23:11.438
Then we need to go to this button

464
00:23:11.438 --> 00:23:15.499
and inspect it, and when it's clicked, I need the

465
00:23:15.499 --> 00:23:19.479
aria-expanded to be set to true or to false,

466
00:23:19.479 --> 00:23:21.024
back and forth, back and forth.

467
00:23:21.024 --> 00:23:23.483
So we're gonna write a little bit of JavaScript to do that.

468
00:23:23.483 --> 00:23:25.890
Initially I had done it with a checkbox hack,

469
00:23:25.890 --> 00:23:30.280
but I found out that the checkbox hack was not accessible

470
00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:32.085
so we're gonna do it with some JavaScript,

471
00:23:32.085 --> 00:23:33.337
which is more accessible.

472
00:23:33.337 --> 00:23:34.813
So we'll go down to our script here,

473
00:23:34.813 --> 00:23:36.623
and we'll grab that nav button.

474
00:23:36.623 --> 00:23:38.726
So we'll say const navButton

475
00:23:38.726 --> 00:23:41.809
is equal to document.querySelectorAll

476
00:23:42.841 --> 00:23:45.679
and we're gonna select it based on it's a button

477
00:23:45.679 --> 00:23:48.846
with an aria-expanded attribute on it.

478
00:23:52.178 --> 00:23:56.813
Then we're going to make a function called toggleNav,

479
00:23:56.813 --> 00:23:59.662
and then just say console log toggle.

480
00:23:59.662 --> 00:24:02.286
And then we'll listen for a click on that nav button,

481
00:24:02.286 --> 00:24:05.619
so let's say navButton.addEventlistener,

482
00:24:07.966 --> 00:24:10.273
and listen for a click,

483
00:24:10.273 --> 00:24:14.457
and when that click happens we're going to toggle the nav.

484
00:24:14.457 --> 00:24:16.525
So if I go to my console here, I click this button,

485
00:24:16.525 --> 00:24:18.386
Oh! I screwed it up.

486
00:24:18.386 --> 00:24:23.128
addEvent, luh, listener.
Capital L, there we go, nope.

487
00:24:23.128 --> 00:24:25.579
And still not a problem, and that is because

488
00:24:25.579 --> 00:24:28.778
I query selected all, I just need querySelector.

489
00:24:28.778 --> 00:24:31.181
We don't want a node list, we want just one node,

490
00:24:31.181 --> 00:24:32.776
the first one that it finds.
There we go.

491
00:24:32.776 --> 00:24:34.428
And now when I click it,

492
00:24:34.428 --> 00:24:38.386
I get toggle is running a number of times, good.

493
00:24:38.386 --> 00:24:39.835
Now inside of this toggleNav,

494
00:24:39.835 --> 00:24:43.729
we are going to destructure the target.

495
00:24:43.729 --> 00:24:47.896
And let's try console.log the target, see what we got.

496
00:24:49.028 --> 00:24:50.951
The target is the button itself, it's the thing

497
00:24:50.951 --> 00:24:54.210
that was clicked, and now what we want to do is

498
00:24:54.210 --> 00:24:56.911
get the aria-expanded attribute.

499
00:24:56.911 --> 00:25:00.411
So we'll say const expanded equals target,

500
00:25:03.112 --> 00:25:08.084
that's the button itself, dot getAttribute aria-expanded.

501
00:25:08.084 --> 00:25:12.123
And we wanna see if it is a string of true,

502
00:25:12.123 --> 00:25:15.105
so console.log expanded and see what value we got.

503
00:25:15.105 --> 00:25:17.633
So it's currently false,

504
00:25:17.633 --> 00:25:19.611
but it actually doesn't return a boolean,

505
00:25:19.611 --> 00:25:22.928
it returns a string of false, so we have to do this little

506
00:25:22.928 --> 00:25:25.636
funky thing where we check if the value

507
00:25:25.636 --> 00:25:28.279
is triple equals to a string of true,

508
00:25:28.279 --> 00:25:32.965
otherwise we're gonna fall back to a boolean of false.

509
00:25:32.965 --> 00:25:35.715
And then we console.log expanded.

510
00:25:36.926 --> 00:25:38.504
You see, we should get, there we go,

511
00:25:38.504 --> 00:25:40.698
booleans of true and false.

512
00:25:40.698 --> 00:25:43.149
In this case it's only false, so good.

513
00:25:43.149 --> 00:25:47.316
Then what we wanna do is set the attribute of our expanded

514
00:25:48.401 --> 00:25:51.830
to be the opposite of what it currently is.

515
00:25:51.830 --> 00:25:54.166
So we'll take our nav button,

516
00:25:54.166 --> 00:25:57.833
and we'll set the attribute of aria-expanded

517
00:26:00.882 --> 00:26:04.742
to be the opposite of the expanded value.

518
00:26:04.742 --> 00:26:06.954
So bang, now we'll just convert true to false

519
00:26:06.954 --> 00:26:09.208
and false to true, and now when we click it,

520
00:26:09.208 --> 00:26:11.405
it should go back and forth between the two.

521
00:26:11.405 --> 00:26:13.399
So we'll have to open up our inspector,

522
00:26:13.399 --> 00:26:16.683
look at the button, and as you click it you see that the

523
00:26:16.683 --> 00:26:19.152
aria-expanded value goes back and forth, back and forth.

524
00:26:19.152 --> 00:26:21.373
So that's all the JavaScript we need to write,

525
00:26:21.373 --> 00:26:24.885
the rest is going to be done in CSS.

526
00:26:24.885 --> 00:26:26.940
So we'll go down to our responsive start,

527
00:26:26.940 --> 00:26:29.668
we'll go down to our 1000px media query,

528
00:26:29.668 --> 00:26:34.594
and we'll say when aria-expanded is equal to true,

529
00:26:34.594 --> 00:26:37.238
the unordered list that comes after it,

530
00:26:37.238 --> 00:26:40.271
this is a tilde selector, sort of like a future sibling,

531
00:26:40.271 --> 00:26:42.824
so whatever unordered list comes in the future,

532
00:26:42.824 --> 00:26:44.940
it's the next one beside it,

533
00:26:44.940 --> 00:26:49.198
then we are going to display: grid on that,

534
00:26:49.198 --> 00:26:52.402
we'll set the max-height to be 500px,

535
00:26:52.402 --> 00:26:53.805
that's just for,

536
00:26:53.805 --> 00:26:55.874
that's just so that we can actually transition it.

537
00:26:55.874 --> 00:26:59.273
And most importantly, we're gonna transform the rotate value

538
00:26:59.273 --> 00:27:02.446
to be zero degrees, or just zero in that case.

539
00:27:02.446 --> 00:27:03.701
And that should actually show it.

540
00:27:03.701 --> 00:27:05.610
So hey, hey, hey!
Now when you click it,

541
00:27:05.610 --> 00:27:08.551
it goes whoop, whoop!
Whoop, whoop!

542
00:27:08.551 --> 00:27:11.168
Opens and closes itself, I'm not totally convinced

543
00:27:11.168 --> 00:27:15.335
on this actual flip out, we're going from rotate 90 degrees

544
00:27:16.228 --> 00:27:18.311
to rotate X zero degrees.

545
00:27:20.168 --> 00:27:23.585
But what you can do is select the parent

546
00:27:23.585 --> 00:27:26.188
of the unordered list, which is the menu,

547
00:27:26.188 --> 00:27:30.355
and put a perspective of something like 800px on it.

548
00:27:31.635 --> 00:27:33.360
Actually we already have a selector for the menu,

549
00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:35.277
let's move that up here

550
00:27:36.434 --> 00:27:39.302
and get rid of this extra selector.

551
00:27:39.302 --> 00:27:41.257
And that should give us a bit more of a convincing,

552
00:27:41.257 --> 00:27:44.412
yeah there we go, it's a bit more of a convincing

553
00:27:44.412 --> 00:27:46.259
go in and out value for us.

554
00:27:46.259 --> 00:27:48.079
Oh, so now,
(laughs)

555
00:27:48.079 --> 00:27:50.781
I've go a bit of a issue here with the buttons actually

556
00:27:50.781 --> 00:27:54.174
still being there.
So we rotated X,

557
00:27:54.174 --> 00:27:56.665
put a max-height of zero, I'm probably forgetting something

558
00:27:56.665 --> 00:27:59.871
let me see here.
Oh, there we go.

559
00:27:59.871 --> 00:28:01.288
Overflow: hidden.

560
00:28:03.466 --> 00:28:05.387
There we go, that will hide its value there,

561
00:28:05.387 --> 00:28:08.914
so now when I click it, bloop, bloop, bloop!

562
00:28:08.914 --> 00:28:12.796
Change that perspective back, the 800px is a little bit much

563
00:28:12.796 --> 00:28:16.288
and the only reason I have this max-height

564
00:28:16.288 --> 00:28:20.121
and this max-height here, if I take those off,

565
00:28:21.003 --> 00:28:23.265
let me show you what actually happens is

566
00:28:23.265 --> 00:28:25.659
it will just like animate itself in and out,

567
00:28:25.659 --> 00:28:27.801
but it won't actually slide up,

568
00:28:27.801 --> 00:28:30.415
and there's no way to slide up to height: auto,

569
00:28:30.415 --> 00:28:32.078
so this is a little trick you can do in CSS

570
00:28:32.078 --> 00:28:34.661
to slide it up to hide to zero.

571
00:28:35.903 --> 00:28:37.671
Good, I'm pretty happy with that.

572
00:28:37.671 --> 00:28:39.798
The other thing is that this X value here,

573
00:28:39.798 --> 00:28:42.672
we need to hide and show that,

574
00:28:42.672 --> 00:28:44.433
and if we look at the HTML values

575
00:28:44.433 --> 00:28:48.367
we have spans inside of them with a class of open

576
00:28:48.367 --> 00:28:50.803
and a class of close.

577
00:28:50.803 --> 00:28:54.803
So we'll go right here and we'll say, copy this.

578
00:28:56.242 --> 00:28:59.598
When the aria-expanded is equal to false,

579
00:28:59.598 --> 00:29:04.470
the close span inside of that will be display: none.

580
00:29:04.470 --> 00:29:08.442
Good, see that just hid the little X right here.

581
00:29:08.442 --> 00:29:12.525
And then when the aria-expanded is equal to true,

582
00:29:14.266 --> 00:29:17.516
the open will be display: inline-block.

583
00:29:20.591 --> 00:29:22.607
So far, so good.

584
00:29:22.607 --> 00:29:24.091
Now you click it, and now the only problem is

585
00:29:24.091 --> 00:29:27.953
that now the little hamburger doesn't show itself.

586
00:29:27.953 --> 00:29:30.798
So I gotta do one more selector here,

587
00:29:30.798 --> 00:29:33.720
when it is open, the close button

588
00:29:33.720 --> 00:29:36.878
is going to be display: none.

589
00:29:36.878 --> 00:29:39.257
And that should allow us to toggle between the two.

590
00:29:39.257 --> 00:29:43.424
Or not close, the open and this should be the close.

591
00:29:46.564 --> 00:29:47.721
There we go.

592
00:29:47.721 --> 00:29:50.136
So close it, there we go, it's opening and closing,

593
00:29:50.136 --> 00:29:51.383
switching the actual value,

594
00:29:51.383 --> 00:29:53.636
you could also put a width on this value here,

595
00:29:53.636 --> 00:29:56.810
see how it's sort of moving but I'll let you fiddle with

596
00:29:56.810 --> 00:29:59.427
the fixed width or making that display grid

597
00:29:59.427 --> 00:30:01.523
or whatever it is that you wanna do

598
00:30:01.523 --> 00:30:03.102
to actually fix that guy.

599
00:30:03.102 --> 00:30:04.824
So that's fixed, the menu,

600
00:30:04.824 --> 00:30:08.372
this is automatically responsive.

601
00:30:08.372 --> 00:30:10.789
Now our taco, so once we hit,

602
00:30:12.251 --> 00:30:14.309
I don't know, about right here,

603
00:30:14.309 --> 00:30:17.774
I'd say that's probably around 700px which is down here.

604
00:30:17.774 --> 00:30:21.081
We'll add it to our 700px media query,

605
00:30:21.081 --> 00:30:24.081
so actually sorry that's right here.

606
00:30:25.983 --> 00:30:29.605
Our about, yeah we're just gonna bring it down to one column

607
00:30:29.605 --> 00:30:32.560
so grid-template-column: 1fr,

608
00:30:32.560 --> 00:30:35.526
and that will just make everything one column.

609
00:30:35.526 --> 00:30:37.495
And once we hit that value, there we go.

610
00:30:37.495 --> 00:30:39.782
It makes itself one column instead of the two

611
00:30:39.782 --> 00:30:41.055
that we previously set it to.

612
00:30:41.055 --> 00:30:42.914
So I really like grid in responsive

613
00:30:42.914 --> 00:30:45.448
because almost always it's simply just redefining

614
00:30:45.448 --> 00:30:48.587
what the grid looks like, and then children will just

615
00:30:48.587 --> 00:30:50.551
snap to where they look to,

616
00:30:50.551 --> 00:30:54.803
regardless of if you've used fr and pixel values,

617
00:30:54.803 --> 00:30:58.432
or if you've used template areas to figure that out.

618
00:30:58.432 --> 00:31:01.503
Then finally, our Instant Grams at the end here.

619
00:31:01.503 --> 00:31:03.424
Those are by default responsive as well

620
00:31:03.424 --> 00:31:05.280
'cause we used minmax and there's nothing

621
00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:06.946
need to be done there.

622
00:31:06.946 --> 00:31:09.380
So everything is looking totally responsive to me.

623
00:31:09.380 --> 00:31:12.213
Hopefully you learned a thing or two along that,

624
00:31:12.213 --> 00:31:14.817
and you can implement some grid into your own value.

625
00:31:14.817 --> 00:31:16.889
See you in the next one.

626
00:31:16.889 --> 00:31:19.306 line:15%
