1
00:00:03.665 --> 00:00:04.688
<v Instructor>We need a couple things</v>

2
00:00:04.688 --> 00:00:06.368
to get up and running.

3
00:00:06.368 --> 00:00:07.880
We need to install a couple things

4
00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:09.096
and download a couple things

5
00:00:09.096 --> 00:00:11.544
before we can start writing some CSS Grid.

6
00:00:11.544 --> 00:00:13.832
First thing we need is to download Firefox,

7
00:00:13.832 --> 00:00:17.176
and the reason why I'm using Firefox here

8
00:00:17.176 --> 00:00:20.728
is not just because they've sponsored this entire course,

9
00:00:20.728 --> 00:00:22.840
which is great, thank you for doing that,

10
00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:24.712
but even if they didn't do that,

11
00:00:24.712 --> 00:00:26.560
I would totally be using Firefox,

12
00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.872
because at the time, the CSS Grid tools in Firefox

13
00:00:29.872 --> 00:00:32.867
are by far the best debugging tools out there.

14
00:00:32.867 --> 00:00:36.066
Chrome currently does have CSS Grid debugging tools,

15
00:00:36.066 --> 00:00:37.722
however they are not very good,

16
00:00:37.722 --> 00:00:39.954
they are very simple.

17
00:00:39.954 --> 00:00:41.882
I'm sure they'll get much better with time,

18
00:00:41.882 --> 00:00:44.963
but currently Firefox is a ways ahead

19
00:00:44.963 --> 00:00:48.474
so we're gonna be using Firefox for the entire course.

20
00:00:48.474 --> 00:00:50.930
Now I'm using Firefox Developer Edition.

21
00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:53.594
You can use any version of Firefox, nightly or stable,

22
00:00:53.594 --> 00:00:55.266
but I recommend getting Developer Edition

23
00:00:55.266 --> 00:00:56.916
just because they're always gonna have

24
00:00:56.916 --> 00:01:00.763
the latest CSS Grid features in Developer

25
00:01:00.763 --> 00:01:03.923
just so that we can debug it and get a

26
00:01:03.923 --> 00:01:04.756
peer into it,

27
00:01:04.756 --> 00:01:06.466
so we'll be using that throughout the course.

28
00:01:06.466 --> 00:01:08.298
Download and install Node.js.

29
00:01:08.298 --> 00:01:10.442
You likely already have this installed,

30
00:01:10.442 --> 00:01:11.610
however, if you do not,

31
00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.282
you can just go ahead and download the current version.

32
00:01:14.282 --> 00:01:15.588
Click next, next, next,

33
00:01:15.588 --> 00:01:17.378
and that will install it on your machine.

34
00:01:17.378 --> 00:01:19.368
The way you can tell if you have it installed

35
00:01:19.368 --> 00:01:22.362
is you can just go to your terminal

36
00:01:22.362 --> 00:01:24.275
and you can use any terminal in this course.

37
00:01:24.275 --> 00:01:26.508
I'm using one called HyperTerm,

38
00:01:26.508 --> 00:01:29.715
but you can use the one that's built into Windows

39
00:01:29.715 --> 00:01:31.538
or the terminal in OS X,

40
00:01:31.538 --> 00:01:34.634
or if you're on Linux, you probably just boot into that.

41
00:01:34.634 --> 00:01:36.099
So you just type node,

42
00:01:36.099 --> 00:01:38.202
if you can spell, node -v,

43
00:01:38.202 --> 00:01:39.177
and that's going to tell you

44
00:01:39.177 --> 00:01:40.936
which version you are currently on.

45
00:01:40.936 --> 00:01:42.376
I'm on 8.6.

46
00:01:42.376 --> 00:01:43.456
Maybe I want it to update,

47
00:01:43.456 --> 00:01:46.664
I would just click this and download the next version.

48
00:01:46.664 --> 00:01:49.385
Third, we need to get the CSS Grid starter file,

49
00:01:49.385 --> 00:01:51.624
so if you log into your course dashboard

50
00:01:51.624 --> 00:01:53.584
at courses.wesbos.com,

51
00:01:53.584 --> 00:01:56.272
you're going to see a link to the starter files.

52
00:01:56.272 --> 00:01:57.481
That's gonna kick you off.

53
00:01:57.481 --> 00:01:59.856
Obviously I don't have the CSS Grid course here yet.

54
00:01:59.856 --> 00:02:02.728
This is just an example for my JavaScript30,

55
00:02:02.728 --> 00:02:04.392
but once the course is live

56
00:02:04.392 --> 00:02:06.008
you'll see it in your dashboard.

57
00:02:06.008 --> 00:02:09.320
You can click off to the CSS Grid.

58
00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:11.032
Right now there's not a whole lot on my GitHub,

59
00:02:11.032 --> 00:02:15.199
but you should see a GitHub repo full of different folders,

60
00:02:16.072 --> 00:02:18.350
and each video, or each couple videos,

61
00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:21.614
is going to have a folder associated with that video,

62
00:02:21.614 --> 00:02:24.374
and we're generally going to have things

63
00:02:24.374 --> 00:02:27.291
like test-START, and test-FINISHED,

64
00:02:28.238 --> 00:02:30.758
and the finished is going to be the state

65
00:02:30.758 --> 00:02:34.422
that the file is in at the end of the video,

66
00:02:34.422 --> 00:02:37.790
and then the start is gonna be any sort of starter HTML

67
00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.855
that you don't necessarily need to write,

68
00:02:39.855 --> 00:02:42.518
that's just sometimes it's just a bit of a waste of time.

69
00:02:42.518 --> 00:02:43.654
So you'll see that.

70
00:02:43.654 --> 00:02:47.334
Go ahead and download the entire thing.

71
00:02:47.334 --> 00:02:50.454
You can also fork it to your own,

72
00:02:50.454 --> 00:02:52.838
however please be careful with forking it,

73
00:02:52.838 --> 00:02:53.734
because what happens,

74
00:02:53.734 --> 00:02:58.550
let me show you here on my JavaScript30, is people will

75
00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:00.534
couple of thousand people have forked it, and then,

76
00:03:00.534 --> 00:03:03.095
when they try to push the changes up to their own repo,

77
00:03:03.095 --> 00:03:07.262
they accidentally make a pull request to my own, which is

78
00:03:08.166 --> 00:03:11.198
it's an accident, but I get a lot of e-mail,

79
00:03:11.198 --> 00:03:14.183
so make sure you're not accidentally pull-requesting me

80
00:03:14.183 --> 00:03:15.654
and you'll be good to go.

81
00:03:15.654 --> 00:03:16.974
So that's all that we have there.

82
00:03:16.974 --> 00:03:19.046
Once you've downloaded all of the files,

83
00:03:19.046 --> 00:03:21.846
what I want you to do is to open them up in your Finder,

84
00:03:21.846 --> 00:03:23.320
and it'll look a little bit something like this,

85
00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:24.902
just with much more folders,

86
00:03:24.902 --> 00:03:29.502
and you'll see that we have a package-lock, a package.json,

87
00:03:29.502 --> 00:03:32.110
and you won't actually see the node_modules folder.

88
00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:33.902
Let me delete that right there.

89
00:03:33.902 --> 00:03:38.069
The package.json, you can open that up in your editor here.

90
00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:40.750
There's really not a whole lot here.

91
00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:43.192
The only reason I asked you to install Node.js is

92
00:03:43.192 --> 00:03:44.174
'cause we're going to be using

93
00:03:44.174 --> 00:03:45.918
a utility called browser-sync,

94
00:03:45.918 --> 00:03:47.574
and what browser-sync does is

95
00:03:47.574 --> 00:03:48.950
it's going to watch all of our

96
00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:50.894
CSS, HTML, and JavaScript files,

97
00:03:50.894 --> 00:03:53.758
and automatically reload them in the browser

98
00:03:53.758 --> 00:03:56.550
so that we can sort of stay in our code here

99
00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:00.506
while just looking at the refreshed results on our left

100
00:04:00.506 --> 00:04:03.750
without having to go over and manually refresh it.

101
00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:07.446
You are totally fine to just open these files up in HTML

102
00:04:07.446 --> 00:04:10.102
in your browser without browser-sync.

103
00:04:10.102 --> 00:04:12.854
You can just scrap this entire piece if you want.

104
00:04:12.854 --> 00:04:14.758
However, I think you're gonna be much more productive

105
00:04:14.758 --> 00:04:18.270
if you use this browser-sync tool that we have here.

106
00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:21.014
You'll see that I've created this script called start,

107
00:04:21.014 --> 00:04:22.174
and all that does is

108
00:04:22.174 --> 00:04:25.110
it runs this command called browser-sync start,

109
00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:27.582
and we pass it a couple different arguments here,

110
00:04:27.582 --> 00:04:28.902
or a couple different flags.

111
00:04:28.902 --> 00:04:30.158
We've got the server which

112
00:04:30.158 --> 00:04:33.718
it creates a local host URL on our computer

113
00:04:33.718 --> 00:04:35.374
that we can visit.

114
00:04:35.374 --> 00:04:37.638
It watches all of our files

115
00:04:37.638 --> 00:04:39.926
that end in css, html, and JavaScript,

116
00:04:39.926 --> 00:04:42.590
and it'll refresh when any of those change.

117
00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:43.622
It's a directory,

118
00:04:43.622 --> 00:04:45.630
and that will show us a listing of our directories,

119
00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:48.830
and then we're running on port 7777,

120
00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:51.470
and then, by default, I'm going to open the browser

121
00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:53.742
called FirefoxDeveloperEdition.

122
00:04:53.742 --> 00:04:54.950
If you would like to change that

123
00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:57.158
to maybe just regular Firefox,

124
00:04:57.158 --> 00:04:58.438
you can just type Firefox,

125
00:04:58.438 --> 00:05:00.006
or if you're using Chrome for some reason,

126
00:05:00.006 --> 00:05:01.686
you could do that as well,

127
00:05:01.686 --> 00:05:04.454
but I'm gonna leave mine at FirefoxDeveloper.

128
00:05:04.454 --> 00:05:08.982
Now what I want you to do is to open up this css-grid folder

129
00:05:08.982 --> 00:05:09.935
in your terminal.

130
00:05:09.935 --> 00:05:13.204
Now if you're not totally sure about how that works,

131
00:05:13.204 --> 00:05:17.229
what you can do, this little trick that I like to do,

132
00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:20.632
is to find the css-grid folder on your computer,

133
00:05:20.632 --> 00:05:22.216
so I'm gonna go one level up.

134
00:05:22.216 --> 00:05:23.232
It's right here.

135
00:05:23.232 --> 00:05:26.536
Type, let's say I'm on the root of my computer,

136
00:05:26.536 --> 00:05:30.703
just type cd, space, and then drag and drop the css-grid

137
00:05:31.784 --> 00:05:33.560
right into there,

138
00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:34.896
and then you know you're in it,

139
00:05:34.896 --> 00:05:38.504
and you can type pwd to see where you are, or ls -l.

140
00:05:38.504 --> 00:05:42.240
You can see that we are in the folder with the package.json.

141
00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:45.984
Then we can go ahead and type npm install, or just npm i,

142
00:05:45.984 --> 00:05:48.536
and that's going to install our one dependency,

143
00:05:48.536 --> 00:05:50.665
the only thing that we need for this entire course,

144
00:05:50.665 --> 00:05:54.576
which is browser-sync, and then we've got it up and running.

145
00:05:54.576 --> 00:05:58.208
Now what I can go ahead and do is type npm start,

146
00:05:58.208 --> 00:05:59.656
and that will open up a directory

147
00:05:59.656 --> 00:06:01.392
of all of our files and folders.

148
00:06:01.392 --> 00:06:04.648
You can go into 02, go to test-START,

149
00:06:04.648 --> 00:06:07.288
and you'll see, sort of, this base style that we got.

150
00:06:07.288 --> 00:06:10.827
Let's go ahead an actually open up that test-START value

151
00:06:10.827 --> 00:06:11.692
that we have here,

152
00:06:11.692 --> 00:06:14.203
and this is just a very basic HTML

153
00:06:14.203 --> 00:06:17.403
that I'll likely start you off with in a lot of our videos.

154
00:06:17.403 --> 00:06:18.395
So what you can do there,

155
00:06:18.395 --> 00:06:20.611
if you just have a paragraph tag and type hello,

156
00:06:20.611 --> 00:06:21.444
and give it a save,

157
00:06:21.444 --> 00:06:22.523
you see it automatically shows up

158
00:06:22.523 --> 00:06:24.267
on the right-hand side here.

159
00:06:24.267 --> 00:06:27.037
Same thing if you have a style tag,

160
00:06:27.037 --> 00:06:28.369
and maybe we have a paragraph,

161
00:06:28.369 --> 00:06:30.922
we wanna change the font size to 20px,

162
00:06:30.922 --> 00:06:33.801
it's gonna automatically change the font size,

163
00:06:33.801 --> 00:06:35.217
or any of the things that we change,

164
00:06:35.217 --> 00:06:37.553
it's automatically gonna change it on our left-hand side,

165
00:06:37.553 --> 00:06:41.249
no manually refreshing that is needed.

166
00:06:41.249 --> 00:06:43.777
This editor that I'm using is VS Code.

167
00:06:43.777 --> 00:06:45.545
You can use any editor that you want,

168
00:06:45.545 --> 00:06:47.329
however I highly recommend

169
00:06:47.329 --> 00:06:50.393
that you use some editor that has Emmet in,

170
00:06:50.393 --> 00:06:54.229
and if you haven't looked at it, just go to emmet.io,

171
00:06:54.229 --> 00:06:58.369
and you can install it for virtually any editor out there.

172
00:06:58.369 --> 00:07:00.634
With VS Code it's automatically built in,

173
00:07:00.634 --> 00:07:03.722
so there's no package that you need to install.

174
00:07:03.722 --> 00:07:04.562
Why do we use that?

175
00:07:04.562 --> 00:07:06.394
Well, I like to do things where, like,

176
00:07:06.394 --> 00:07:09.530
if we want a container, and then,

177
00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:13.738
inside of that container we want a, like, 10 items,

178
00:07:13.738 --> 00:07:15.818
and we hit tab, that's gonna give us 10.

179
00:07:15.818 --> 00:07:18.610
So I'm gonna be giving you these little snippets to type,

180
00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:21.721
and then to hit either Enter or hit Tab,

181
00:07:21.721 --> 00:07:24.274
and that will automatically complete the HTML

182
00:07:24.274 --> 00:07:25.873
that we're actually looking for.

183
00:07:25.873 --> 00:07:27.986
Same with inside of CSS.

184
00:07:27.986 --> 00:07:30.459
If I do something like font-size: 50,

185
00:07:30.459 --> 00:07:32.935
I could just type fz50 + Tab,

186
00:07:32.935 --> 00:07:34.383
and that's going to complete it.

187
00:07:34.383 --> 00:07:36.159
Those things are not necessary,

188
00:07:36.159 --> 00:07:38.119
but it's gonna make us much more productive,

189
00:07:38.119 --> 00:07:40.559
so I recommend that you install that,

190
00:07:40.559 --> 00:07:42.087
and I'll sort of show you how it works

191
00:07:42.087 --> 00:07:44.551
as we go along the way.

192
00:07:44.551 --> 00:07:46.871
Why does this look so dang good already?

193
00:07:46.871 --> 00:07:49.679
Well, I have a sort of a base CSS

194
00:07:49.679 --> 00:07:51.055
that I'm gonna be giving you.

195
00:07:51.055 --> 00:07:52.575
I'm gonna run through it real quick

196
00:07:52.575 --> 00:07:56.119
just to give you a heads-up of what is in this base CSS.

197
00:07:56.119 --> 00:07:58.871
There's not a whole lot related to CSS Grid,

198
00:07:58.871 --> 00:08:02.839
but it's more just CSS that makes it look good,

199
00:08:02.839 --> 00:08:05.311
and when we're trying to debug things

200
00:08:05.311 --> 00:08:06.575
it will look a little nice,

201
00:08:06.575 --> 00:08:08.655
so let's open, actually, that up.

202
00:08:08.655 --> 00:08:12.191
It's in our assets folder, and it's style.css.

203
00:08:12.191 --> 00:08:15.383
First up, we have a couple CSS variables,

204
00:08:15.383 --> 00:08:17.071
if you've never used these before.

205
00:08:17.071 --> 00:08:20.791
I really like to use specific yellows and specific blacks,

206
00:08:20.791 --> 00:08:23.767
'cause, I don't know, have some pride in your demos here.

207
00:08:23.767 --> 00:08:24.735
Make them look decent.

208
00:08:24.735 --> 00:08:26.167
Don't use red, green, and blue,

209
00:08:26.167 --> 00:08:30.279
the base colors that we always use, use some nice colors.

210
00:08:30.279 --> 00:08:31.112
The problem is

211
00:08:31.112 --> 00:08:33.679
I don't expect you to remember what this hex code is here.

212
00:08:33.679 --> 00:08:35.354
So what we can do is,

213
00:08:35.354 --> 00:08:38.187
if you want the thing to be, like,

214
00:08:39.023 --> 00:08:43.564
border-bottom: 10px solid, and I just say yellow,

215
00:08:43.564 --> 00:08:46.675
that's not the actual yellow that I'm looking for.

216
00:08:46.675 --> 00:08:51.523
So what we can do is you can say var(--yellow),

217
00:08:51.523 --> 00:08:52.763
and then what that's going to do is

218
00:08:52.763 --> 00:08:55.052
it's going to pull in that specific yellow

219
00:08:55.052 --> 00:08:58.475
that I had been using in this style.css value.

220
00:08:58.475 --> 00:09:01.808
Same with, here, if I said color: black,

221
00:09:03.371 --> 00:09:05.020
that's going to be pure black,

222
00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:07.924
but if I were to var it --black,

223
00:09:07.924 --> 00:09:10.892
it's gonna give us that little bit of a lighter black value

224
00:09:10.892 --> 00:09:11.789
that we have there.

225
00:09:11.789 --> 00:09:13.835
So if you have a couple different colors

226
00:09:13.835 --> 00:09:15.172
that you like to use

227
00:09:15.172 --> 00:09:17.620
through all of the files that we're doing here,

228
00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:19.828
you can just stick them in the root here,

229
00:09:19.828 --> 00:09:21.819
and they'll be available in all of our files

230
00:09:21.819 --> 00:09:23.668
that we have there.

231
00:09:23.668 --> 00:09:26.067
Next up, box-sizing: border-box.

232
00:09:26.067 --> 00:09:27.587
That will just make sure that

233
00:09:27.587 --> 00:09:30.572
any time we add padding or a border to an element,

234
00:09:30.572 --> 00:09:32.612
it does not increase the size,

235
00:09:32.612 --> 00:09:34.692
so that when we're trying to divvy up

236
00:09:34.692 --> 00:09:37.172
the width of a container,

237
00:09:37.172 --> 00:09:38.299
then we have it there.

238
00:09:38.299 --> 00:09:40.084
If you're unfamiliar with that,

239
00:09:40.084 --> 00:09:42.348
maybe do a quick google into how that works,

240
00:09:42.348 --> 00:09:45.612
and the traditional way, how it was broken for a long time.

241
00:09:45.612 --> 00:09:47.788
We're using just a base font.

242
00:09:47.788 --> 00:09:50.108
I'm setting the color of everything to be black,

243
00:09:50.108 --> 00:09:52.212
and there's a little bit of a text-shadow

244
00:09:52.212 --> 00:09:53.907
on most of the stuff.

245
00:09:53.907 --> 00:09:56.075
I don't know if you can really see that.

246
00:09:56.075 --> 00:10:00.179
Next up, this is the inherit of the box-sizing: border-box,

247
00:10:00.179 --> 00:10:01.395
that's where we've set it here.

248
00:10:01.395 --> 00:10:02.451
Apparently that's a little bit better

249
00:10:02.451 --> 00:10:04.983
than setting everything to box-sizing: border-box,

250
00:10:04.983 --> 00:10:08.278
and then I just have a little bit of a background here.

251
00:10:08.278 --> 00:10:10.687
It's kind of a nice little gradient with a topography.

252
00:10:10.687 --> 00:10:11.520
Makes it look nice.

253
00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:13.814
Nothing to do with that.

254
00:10:13.814 --> 00:10:16.247
I apply some margin to my things,

255
00:10:16.247 --> 00:10:19.646
and then, finally, I am using CSS Grid in each of our items.

256
00:10:19.646 --> 00:10:21.991
We'll talk more about what an item is in a bit,

257
00:10:21.991 --> 00:10:24.151
but I just like to center the content

258
00:10:24.151 --> 00:10:27.511
inside of the actual item that we have.

259
00:10:27.511 --> 00:10:28.415
So that's it.

260
00:10:28.415 --> 00:10:30.975
That's the base CSS that we have there.

261
00:10:30.975 --> 00:10:33.551
Everything else, we're going to be writing,

262
00:10:33.551 --> 00:10:35.286
either in a separate CSS file,

263
00:10:35.286 --> 00:10:38.415
or most likely we're just gonna be writing in a style tag,

264
00:10:38.415 --> 00:10:41.510
directly in the HTML file that we're working with.

265
00:10:41.510 --> 00:10:43.654
If you have any other questions about my setup,

266
00:10:43.654 --> 00:10:48.206
I likely have answered it as wesbos.com/uses,

267
00:10:48.206 --> 00:10:52.839
and here I try to detail all of the different themes,

268
00:10:52.839 --> 00:10:56.454
and fonts, and everything that I use in my editor.

269
00:10:56.454 --> 00:10:59.070
If something is not there, feel free to tweet me.

270
00:10:59.070 --> 00:11:02.726
I am @wesbos on Twitter, and I'll try to answer those,

271
00:11:02.726 --> 00:11:03.878
as many as I can.

272
00:11:03.878 --> 00:11:05.734
Other than that, let's get rolling.

273
00:11:05.734 --> 00:11:08.317
I'll see you in the next video.
