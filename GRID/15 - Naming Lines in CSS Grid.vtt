(uptempo music)

2
00:00:03.454 --> 00:00:05.380
<v Wes>In the last video, we looked at how you</v>

3
00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:07.276
sort of get these line names for free

4
00:00:07.276 --> 00:00:08.573
when you already make areas.

5
00:00:08.573 --> 00:00:10.837
However, if you would like to name your lines

6
00:00:10.837 --> 00:00:13.423
specific names, that's totally doable as well.

7
00:00:13.423 --> 00:00:15.091
So, let's look at an example for that.

8
00:00:15.091 --> 00:00:18.478
Open up 15, Naming Lines, Start.

9
00:00:18.478 --> 00:00:21.339
So, I've already given you some base grid here.

10
00:00:21.339 --> 00:00:23.376
This is a similar example we did in the past,

11
00:00:23.376 --> 00:00:26.401
where one per unit, 500 pixels in the middle,

12
00:00:26.401 --> 00:00:28.228
and one free unit on the right.

13
00:00:28.228 --> 00:00:32.185
And then I have 10 columns, they're all auto-sized

14
00:00:32.185 --> 00:00:35.477
and then, after that, they turn into implicit rows,

15
00:00:35.477 --> 00:00:37.061
sorry rows not columns.

16
00:00:37.061 --> 00:00:41.508
Now, if I wanted to take, let's take my item three

17
00:00:41.508 --> 00:00:46.325
and let's just give it a background of pale goldenrod.

18
00:00:46.325 --> 00:00:47.209
Oh, that's ugly.

19
00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:49.292
Let's get something else.

20
00:00:50.231 --> 00:00:51.739
Slate blue.

21
00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:52.572
Beautiful.

22
00:00:52.572 --> 00:00:55.109
Okay, let's say I wanted to take that item three

23
00:00:55.109 --> 00:00:58.005
and I wanted to put it in the middle

24
00:00:58.005 --> 00:01:00.910
and then span all the way to the top.

25
00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:03.149
What I could do is use the track numbers

26
00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.676
to put exactly where I would want it to go.

27
00:01:05.676 --> 00:01:07.789
So, Grid Column.

28
00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:09.872
I could say start at two.

29
00:01:11.435 --> 00:01:13.280
And that's going to put it there.

30
00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.595
I could say Grid Row.

31
00:01:15.595 --> 00:01:17.937
I want to start at Row one.

32
00:01:17.937 --> 00:01:19.251
That will put it up there.

33
00:01:19.251 --> 00:01:22.206
And then, I also want it to go as high as 10,

34
00:01:22.206 --> 00:01:23.874
so will say Span 10.

35
00:01:23.874 --> 00:01:25.499
And that will make it go 10 high.

36
00:01:25.499 --> 00:01:26.757
So that's what I'm looking for,

37
00:01:26.757 --> 00:01:29.675
but we can also name these lines

38
00:01:29.675 --> 00:01:31.611
rather than just using numbers.

39
00:01:31.611 --> 00:01:34.063
So, the way that you do that is, again,

40
00:01:34.063 --> 00:01:37.685
the lines are not the columns themselves,

41
00:01:37.685 --> 00:01:40.262
they are the sort of the lines

42
00:01:40.262 --> 00:01:41.851
in between the columns though.

43
00:01:41.851 --> 00:01:43.601
One, two, three, four

44
00:01:45.103 --> 00:01:46.805
wouldn't it be nice if those had names?

45
00:01:46.805 --> 00:01:48.497
And the way that you can name your lines,

46
00:01:48.497 --> 00:01:52.548
is by using square brackets when you define your column.

47
00:01:52.548 --> 00:01:56.715
So, I'm going to say, this could be the Sight Left

48
00:01:57.694 --> 00:02:00.235
and then, the one in between that,

49
00:02:00.235 --> 00:02:03.149
I'm going to say that is the Content Start,

50
00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.457
and then after that, I'm going to say

51
00:02:05.457 --> 00:02:07.936
that is the Content End.

52
00:02:07.936 --> 00:02:09.734
And then finally, at the very end,

53
00:02:09.734 --> 00:02:12.067
I'm going to say Sight Right

54
00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:18.805
and that will name my lines as we go from here to there.

55
00:02:18.805 --> 00:02:21.297
Same things with the template rows.

56
00:02:21.297 --> 00:02:23.949
I could say something like Content Top.

57
00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:27.282
I could stick 10 columns inside of there

58
00:02:28.235 --> 00:02:30.124
and then at the bottom of those 10 columns,

59
00:02:30.124 --> 00:02:32.362
I'll say Content Bottom.

60
00:02:32.362 --> 00:02:33.979
And what that'll do is it will name the lines.

61
00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:36.068
You can still use the numbers in addition to the lines,

62
00:02:36.068 --> 00:02:38.459
but sometimes it's nicer just to be able to

63
00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:40.598
refer to the lines, especially if you're going to be

64
00:02:40.598 --> 00:02:45.188
changing them at a later point in a media query.

65
00:02:45.188 --> 00:02:47.057
So, give that a Save here.

66
00:02:47.057 --> 00:02:48.303
Now I want to change this over.

67
00:02:48.303 --> 00:02:51.260
I would want the grid column to start

68
00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.510
at this one. Content Start.

69
00:02:54.703 --> 00:02:57.954
So, I would just change that to Content Start.

70
00:02:57.954 --> 00:02:59.805
And it doesn't change anything,

71
00:02:59.805 --> 00:03:02.291
maybe I'll comment this out so we can see here.

72
00:03:02.291 --> 00:03:06.458
And then I want the grid row to start at the Content Top

73
00:03:07.301 --> 00:03:10.778
because that was our, that's this line right here.

74
00:03:10.778 --> 00:03:12.111
Say Content Top.

75
00:03:13.474 --> 00:03:15.798
And I want it to end at the Content Bottom,

76
00:03:15.798 --> 00:03:19.082
which is 10 rows down, down here.

77
00:03:19.082 --> 00:03:20.488
So, Content Bottom.

78
00:03:20.488 --> 00:03:23.672
And again, these Dot Dash Tops and Dash Bottoms,

79
00:03:23.672 --> 00:03:27.039
these are not magic as the start and end,

80
00:03:27.039 --> 00:03:28.108
where in the last one,

81
00:03:28.108 --> 00:03:31.536
these are just line names that I've created myself.

82
00:03:31.536 --> 00:03:32.699
So, give that a Save.

83
00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:33.532
There we go.

84
00:03:33.532 --> 00:03:36.514
Now it's Spanning from the Content Start to Content End

85
00:03:36.514 --> 00:03:38.574
and all the way to the bottom.

86
00:03:38.574 --> 00:03:40.102
One other thing you should know about that is,

87
00:03:40.102 --> 00:03:43.805
you can assign multiple values here

88
00:03:43.805 --> 00:03:47.998
because sometimes you might also want to say

89
00:03:47.998 --> 00:03:49.581
this is the Sidebar

90
00:03:51.564 --> 00:03:53.147
Start Site as well.

91
00:03:54.782 --> 00:03:57.678
It's both the start of the sidebar

92
00:03:57.678 --> 00:03:59.521
and the start of the site.

93
00:03:59.521 --> 00:04:01.853
And then, when you start the content,

94
00:04:01.853 --> 00:04:06.791
it's both the sidebar and the content start, right?

95
00:04:06.791 --> 00:04:08.819
Sometimes you need to name them multiple things at once.

96
00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:10.268
So, this can get pretty hairy,

97
00:04:10.268 --> 00:04:13.368
just feel free to put them on their own lines

98
00:04:13.368 --> 00:04:15.388
so you can visualize it a little bit easier.

99
00:04:15.388 --> 00:04:19.763
Again, the dev tools don't show you the names of the lines,

100
00:04:19.763 --> 00:04:22.239
but maybe that'll be something that's coming

101
00:04:22.239 --> 00:04:23.557
in the future.

102
00:04:23.557 --> 00:04:25.082
I would really like to see that.

103
00:04:25.082 --> 00:04:26.716
So, now that we know that,

104
00:04:26.716 --> 00:04:29.401
let's look at our grid auto-flow dense,

105
00:04:29.401 --> 00:04:31.313
which is something I've really been looking forward to.

106
00:04:31.313 --> 00:04:33.896
(upbeat music)
