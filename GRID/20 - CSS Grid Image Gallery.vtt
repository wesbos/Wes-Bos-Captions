00:00:04.291 --> 00:00:06.354
<v Speaker>All right, in this episode,</v>

2
00:00:06.354 --> 00:00:10.324
we're gonna be making an image gallery using CSS Grid,

3
00:00:10.324 --> 00:00:11.774
and it's actually pretty nifty because

4
00:00:11.774 --> 00:00:14.246
as wide as the image gallery gets,

5
00:00:14.246 --> 00:00:17.980
you see that these items sort of just fit into each other

6
00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:21.801
and that's using our grid autoflow dense that we have.

7
00:00:21.801 --> 00:00:23.598
And then when you click on one of them,

8
00:00:23.598 --> 00:00:25.266
it pops up a little overlay here,

9
00:00:25.266 --> 00:00:27.037
and will show you the actual full image.

10
00:00:27.037 --> 00:00:29.147
Just some of them are tiny little slivers.

11
00:00:29.147 --> 00:00:31.457
You could click them and see the full version, so

12
00:00:31.457 --> 00:00:34.766
let me talk about the idea behind this image gallery.

13
00:00:34.766 --> 00:00:38.433
The idea is that, as we know, with CSS Grid,

14
00:00:39.589 --> 00:00:42.766
not everything fits into each other perfectly.

15
00:00:42.766 --> 00:00:45.578
You just can't throw a whole bunch of random sized things

16
00:00:45.578 --> 00:00:47.971
and expect them all to fit in perfectly.

17
00:00:47.971 --> 00:00:50.659
Let me open up inspect element here

18
00:00:50.659 --> 00:00:53.326
and turn on our layout for grid.

19
00:00:54.205 --> 00:00:55.689
This is our gallery here.

20
00:00:55.689 --> 00:00:58.254
So what the idea behind this is that I'm making all of these

21
00:00:58.254 --> 00:01:01.921
possible sizes, I'm making them all based on

22
00:01:03.074 --> 00:01:07.056
a hundred pixel grid, so our grid is always gonna be

23
00:01:07.056 --> 00:01:08.824
a hundred pixels by a hundred pixels,

24
00:01:08.824 --> 00:01:11.706
and then each of these images is just going to span

25
00:01:11.706 --> 00:01:15.706
a random amount, between one wide and four wide,

26
00:01:17.153 --> 00:01:20.131
and one high and four wide.

27
00:01:20.131 --> 00:01:22.317
You can see, sometimes they're tiny, one by one.

28
00:01:22.317 --> 00:01:25.811
Sometimes, they're gonna be huge by going four by four.

29
00:01:25.811 --> 00:01:27.437
And that's gonna be totally random,

30
00:01:27.437 --> 00:01:31.800
but my idea is that by having a lot of these extra little

31
00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.923
one by ones, like right here,

32
00:01:34.923 --> 00:01:39.503
it's going to hopefully fill all of the gaps.

33
00:01:39.503 --> 00:01:41.370
You can see it's not perfect, in this case,

34
00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:44.634
there is one missing, 'cause maybe there wasn't enough,

35
00:01:44.634 --> 00:01:46.045
but if I were to refresh this,

36
00:01:46.045 --> 00:01:48.700
you see that it's actually starting to look pretty good

37
00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.096
at the end, maybe we'll add a couple extra one by ones so

38
00:01:51.096 --> 00:01:53.677
I like to think of these little ones as sort of filler,

39
00:01:53.677 --> 00:01:56.804
and they will sort of fill up, so we'll add

40
00:01:56.804 --> 00:01:59.009
a little bit more to fix those up,

41
00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.236
so this is going to require a little bit of Javascript,

42
00:02:02.236 --> 00:02:07.113
so options here, if you don't feel like writing Javascript,

43
00:02:07.113 --> 00:02:10.319
you can just go into the finished version

44
00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.972
and just copy paste all of the Javascript

45
00:02:12.972 --> 00:02:15.512
and that will get you up and running,

46
00:02:15.512 --> 00:02:17.496
but, I don't know, it's fun.

47
00:02:17.496 --> 00:02:19.874
I think a lot of you will like to sort of

48
00:02:19.874 --> 00:02:21.984
code along with it, so feel free to give this one a shot.

49
00:02:21.984 --> 00:02:24.141
This one's a little bit more advanced, so

50
00:02:24.141 --> 00:02:28.731
don't feel like you have to do this one all by yourselves.

51
00:02:28.731 --> 00:02:31.001
You can start a code along with me.

52
00:02:31.001 --> 00:02:33.767
Good, all right, let's kick it off,

53
00:02:33.767 --> 00:02:35.649
just understanding what we're sort of starting with here

54
00:02:35.649 --> 00:02:36.748
in our starter files.

55
00:02:36.748 --> 00:02:40.442
First, we have an overlay, and that's going to be this ...

56
00:02:40.442 --> 00:02:42.396
When you click on one of them, that's gonna be this

57
00:02:42.396 --> 00:02:43.883
gray or black overlay.

58
00:02:43.883 --> 00:02:47.289
And then inside of that, we have an overlay inner,

59
00:02:47.289 --> 00:02:50.711
which has just two things, just a button to close it

60
00:02:50.711 --> 00:02:53.361
and an image, a tag that is actually

61
00:02:53.361 --> 00:02:55.544
going to be showing the image.

62
00:02:55.544 --> 00:02:59.354
This isn't the most bulletproof image gallery ever made,

63
00:02:59.354 --> 00:03:01.933
but it should give you a sort of a good head start

64
00:03:01.933 --> 00:03:03.247
to making your own.

65
00:03:03.247 --> 00:03:07.230
Then we also have our gallery which is going to be our grid,

66
00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:08.543
that's this thing right here,

67
00:03:08.543 --> 00:03:11.039
and there's nothing in it because I don't wanna manually

68
00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:13.307
code all of these sizes by hand,

69
00:03:13.307 --> 00:03:16.244
so we're actually gonna generate them with Javascript.

70
00:03:16.244 --> 00:03:20.400
Similarly, in the image folder, I've just got a bunch

71
00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.507
of 500 by 500 pixel images.

72
00:03:22.507 --> 00:03:25.088
They're all gonna be 500 pixels wide,

73
00:03:25.088 --> 00:03:28.285
and then we're going to be using the future of CSS,

74
00:03:28.285 --> 00:03:32.452
called object fit, in order to make them fit perfectly,

75
00:03:33.345 --> 00:03:35.426
sort of like background size cover,

76
00:03:35.426 --> 00:03:36.596
if you've ever used that.

77
00:03:36.596 --> 00:03:39.397
Let's keep going in the starter files,

78
00:03:39.397 --> 00:03:40.462
what else do we got?

79
00:03:40.462 --> 00:03:42.159
Some base CSS here.

80
00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:44.995
I haven't imported that other base CSS in here.

81
00:03:44.995 --> 00:03:47.422
This is just some stuff that we have.

82
00:03:47.422 --> 00:03:49.691
I have styled the close button

83
00:03:49.691 --> 00:03:52.191
and the actual overlay itself.

84
00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:55.025
We'll go back into what that is,

85
00:03:55.025 --> 00:03:56.783
but it's sort of the heavy lifting,

86
00:03:56.783 --> 00:03:58.617
which is the grid right here.

87
00:03:58.617 --> 00:04:00.814
Haven't done any of that with you,

88
00:04:00.814 --> 00:04:04.936
as well as the sort of, the centering and the little

89
00:04:04.936 --> 00:04:06.634
animation that we have going on here.

90
00:04:06.634 --> 00:04:07.873
So, let's get it going.

91
00:04:07.873 --> 00:04:10.909
The first thing we wanna do is actually generate

92
00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:14.619
some gallery images, so let's go down to the

93
00:04:14.619 --> 00:04:17.137
script tag here, and start writing some code.

94
00:04:17.137 --> 00:04:20.598
We want to first select the gallery itself,

95
00:04:20.598 --> 00:04:24.160
so we'll get the gallery, and then I also need the overlay

96
00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.388
and these things are going to be very similar,

97
00:04:26.388 --> 00:04:30.380
so I'll just say const gallery equals document

98
00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:34.530
dot query selector, and we're gonna select something

99
00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:37.251
with a class gallery and a class overlay.

100
00:04:37.251 --> 00:04:40.349
And then inside the overlay, we also need the image itself

101
00:04:40.349 --> 00:04:43.044
so that we can update it when you click it

102
00:04:43.044 --> 00:04:46.439
and the close button, which is that, so we'll say

103
00:04:46.439 --> 00:04:50.544
const overlay image is equal to overlay dot query selector.

104
00:04:50.544 --> 00:04:52.611
We'll look inside of that for the image tag

105
00:04:52.611 --> 00:04:56.636
and then we'll also look inside of it for the button.

106
00:04:56.636 --> 00:05:00.512
Actually, we'll call this close, and that has a class

107
00:05:00.512 --> 00:05:01.601
of close on it.

108
00:05:01.601 --> 00:05:05.768
Good, now what we need is a sort of a little function here

109
00:05:06.732 --> 00:05:09.411
that's going to generate some html for us

110
00:05:09.411 --> 00:05:12.578
based on passed in widths and heights,

111
00:05:13.566 --> 00:05:17.199
so again, the idea behind this is that it's going to ...

112
00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:20.699
Between one and four width, or horizontal,

113
00:05:21.908 --> 00:05:25.046
and one and four height, or vertical,

114
00:05:25.046 --> 00:05:27.612
I'm gonna be calling it, and then in our CSS,

115
00:05:27.612 --> 00:05:29.776
we're going to just assign, let me show you here

116
00:05:29.776 --> 00:05:32.076
what it's actually looking like.

117
00:05:32.076 --> 00:05:36.056
Whoa, firefox screenshots, whoa, this is not what I wanted.

118
00:05:36.056 --> 00:05:38.675
Okay, hold on, right click, inspect element,

119
00:05:38.675 --> 00:05:42.073
and if we open our gallery up, you see actually

120
00:05:42.073 --> 00:05:45.197
what's being generated is that they all have a H,

121
00:05:45.197 --> 00:05:48.861
like one, H four, H two, and each of those

122
00:05:48.861 --> 00:05:52.258
H one, H four, H twos correspond with a different

123
00:05:52.258 --> 00:05:56.947
span value, so this one has a H two, which means

124
00:05:56.947 --> 00:05:59.702
that it's gonna horizontally span two on the column,

125
00:05:59.702 --> 00:06:02.509
and then it has a V three, which means it's going to

126
00:06:02.509 --> 00:06:05.252
vertically span the row three.

127
00:06:05.252 --> 00:06:06.334
You get the point, right?

128
00:06:06.334 --> 00:06:08.316
So here we'll make a function called

129
00:06:08.316 --> 00:06:12.019
generate html, and that's going to take in a

130
00:06:12.019 --> 00:06:14.186
horizontal and a vertical.

131
00:06:16.798 --> 00:06:18.955
I've used destructuring there, if you're not sure

132
00:06:18.955 --> 00:06:20.592
what that little thing was.

133
00:06:20.592 --> 00:06:22.048
And then from that, we are gonna return

134
00:06:22.048 --> 00:06:23.645
just some backtext that we have here

135
00:06:23.645 --> 00:06:27.670
and that will give us a ... let's give ourselves a div,

136
00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:30.920
and that div will have a class of item,

137
00:06:32.673 --> 00:06:36.584
and then the H value that gets passed in,

138
00:06:36.584 --> 00:06:39.634
oh, that's not pound, it's dollar sign

139
00:06:39.634 --> 00:06:43.801
and the V with the V sign that we've passed in, good.

140
00:06:45.475 --> 00:06:47.424
And then inside of that, we need image tag

141
00:06:47.424 --> 00:06:51.591
with the source is going to be images forward slash ...

142
00:06:53.368 --> 00:06:55.923
And we've got one, two, three, four, five, six, seven,

143
00:06:55.923 --> 00:06:58.848
eight, nine, let's just use one dot jpeg for now,

144
00:06:58.848 --> 00:07:03.015
and then we will also give an overlay item to this

145
00:07:03.953 --> 00:07:07.219
and that's this little yellow spot that sort of comes up

146
00:07:07.219 --> 00:07:10.020
from the bottom when you hover over top of it, so

147
00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:14.650
that is going to be a div with the class of item

148
00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:18.884
underscore, underscore overlay, I'm just using some

149
00:07:18.884 --> 00:07:21.717
Bem here, and then inside of that,

150
00:07:23.303 --> 00:07:27.519
we'll have a button that will say, "View".

151
00:07:27.519 --> 00:07:31.362
And that button is going to trigger the actual opening

152
00:07:31.362 --> 00:07:33.572
of the value that we have, good.

153
00:07:33.572 --> 00:07:36.084
So we have this generate html function here.

154
00:07:36.084 --> 00:07:38.993
Next up, I want to make a quick little helper function

155
00:07:38.993 --> 00:07:40.403
that's gonna give us a random number

156
00:07:40.403 --> 00:07:44.053
between one and something, so we'll say function,

157
00:07:44.053 --> 00:07:45.220
random number,

158
00:07:49.814 --> 00:07:52.099
and I'm gonna pass in sort of like an upper limit,

159
00:07:52.099 --> 00:07:55.763
and from that, we're gonna return math dot four,

160
00:07:55.763 --> 00:07:59.180
math dot random times the limit plus one.

161
00:08:03.463 --> 00:08:05.023
And then what we can do up here

162
00:08:05.023 --> 00:08:08.773
is swap out this one with the actual function

163
00:08:09.882 --> 00:08:13.745
that we just made, which is random number.

164
00:08:13.745 --> 00:08:16.013
I have 12 images, so it's gonna give us

165
00:08:16.013 --> 00:08:18.180
between 1 and 12 dot jpeg.

166
00:08:19.896 --> 00:08:23.630
Cool, and all right, let's go ahead and start making

167
00:08:23.630 --> 00:08:26.582
a bunch of images, so I wanna do ...

168
00:08:26.582 --> 00:08:28.636
Let's start with 50 images, and we can pop them

169
00:08:28.636 --> 00:08:30.191
on the actual screen.

170
00:08:30.191 --> 00:08:33.524
So what I like to do is, I need an array

171
00:08:35.655 --> 00:08:39.601
of a bunch of arrays, meaning that I wanna just get

172
00:08:39.601 --> 00:08:42.140
a bunch of things that are ... maybe the first one is

173
00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:45.796
one wide and four high, and then maybe the next one is

174
00:08:45.796 --> 00:08:48.459
two wide and two high, and maybe the next one is

175
00:08:48.459 --> 00:08:51.226
three or four wide, and one high, right?

176
00:08:51.226 --> 00:08:54.738
I basically just want a bunch of random arrays

177
00:08:54.738 --> 00:08:56.346
where the first thing is going to be

178
00:08:56.346 --> 00:08:58.402
how many columns it spans, and the second thing

179
00:08:58.402 --> 00:09:01.402
is how many rows it's going to span.

180
00:09:02.339 --> 00:09:04.575
So the way that I figured we could do that is

181
00:09:04.575 --> 00:09:06.616
we'll just make a digits variable here

182
00:09:06.616 --> 00:09:08.613
and we'll just make a empty array,

183
00:09:08.613 --> 00:09:11.050
and the way that you can make an empty array

184
00:09:11.050 --> 00:09:13.532
with the 50 blank spots is just using

185
00:09:13.532 --> 00:09:16.826
the array dot from, and you pass it an object

186
00:09:16.826 --> 00:09:19.358
that just has a length property on it.

187
00:09:19.358 --> 00:09:21.759
Pretty neat little trick, oops.

188
00:09:21.759 --> 00:09:25.981
Array dot from also takes a map function,

189
00:09:25.981 --> 00:09:29.335
which will allow us to populate what goes into

190
00:09:29.335 --> 00:09:32.700
each one of those, so what will go into each one

191
00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:35.812
is a random number between one and four

192
00:09:35.812 --> 00:09:39.803
and then another random number between one and four.

193
00:09:39.803 --> 00:09:42.198
So let's just console dot log the digits

194
00:09:42.198 --> 00:09:44.478
and see what we're dealing with.

195
00:09:44.478 --> 00:09:46.660
Go to our console tab here, good.

196
00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:49.379
So when we load the page, we are getting an array

197
00:09:49.379 --> 00:09:53.052
of arrays, and we get 50 items, and each one has

198
00:09:53.052 --> 00:09:56.385
two two, three four, four one, four two,

199
00:09:57.999 --> 00:09:59.089
you get the point, right?

200
00:09:59.089 --> 00:10:01.165
And this is great because this is just a bunch

201
00:10:01.165 --> 00:10:04.317
of random things that we're then going to pass

202
00:10:04.317 --> 00:10:06.838
into this generate html.

203
00:10:06.838 --> 00:10:10.626
So what we need to do now is make an html variable,

204
00:10:10.626 --> 00:10:12.961
so we'll say const html is equal to,

205
00:10:12.961 --> 00:10:15.486
we'll take that digits array, and we'll map over

206
00:10:15.486 --> 00:10:18.123
each one, and we'll simply just pass it to

207
00:10:18.123 --> 00:10:19.706
this generate html.

208
00:10:21.534 --> 00:10:25.028
So see what's going to happen is for each of these,

209
00:10:25.028 --> 00:10:27.722
it's going to pass in the array one three,

210
00:10:27.722 --> 00:10:30.900
and those are immediately going to be destructured

211
00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:34.932
into the horizontal and the vertical values

212
00:10:34.932 --> 00:10:37.226
and they're gonna be put into here.

213
00:10:37.226 --> 00:10:39.768
So digits dot map, generate html,

214
00:10:39.768 --> 00:10:41.960
we'll join it on the end, just so that it will

215
00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:44.673
convert it to a string, and let's just console dot log

216
00:10:44.673 --> 00:10:47.027
that html, see what we're dealing with.

217
00:10:47.027 --> 00:10:48.465
Woohoo, look at this.

218
00:10:48.465 --> 00:10:50.379
So we got a div with a class of item

219
00:10:50.379 --> 00:10:52.115
and then every single one,

220
00:10:52.115 --> 00:10:53.624
watch as I refresh the page, they're always

221
00:10:53.624 --> 00:10:56.753
gonna be different, H four, H two, H one, H four, H four,

222
00:10:56.753 --> 00:10:59.806
H four, seems like H four a lot, H one.

223
00:10:59.806 --> 00:11:01.718
You get the point, right?

224
00:11:01.718 --> 00:11:03.954
We're just generating a whole bunch of html,

225
00:11:03.954 --> 00:11:06.548
and now what we can do is we can take our gallery,

226
00:11:06.548 --> 00:11:10.002
which is this value that we've selected up here,

227
00:11:10.002 --> 00:11:12.325
and we can just set the inner html

228
00:11:12.325 --> 00:11:14.534
to be that html that we have.

229
00:11:14.534 --> 00:11:17.187
And there we go, watch this, when the page loads,

230
00:11:17.187 --> 00:11:21.270
we're going to get a whole bunch of random images

231
00:11:22.279 --> 00:11:26.130
popping up, see, every time it loads,

232
00:11:26.130 --> 00:11:28.838
this is going to be different random images,

233
00:11:28.838 --> 00:11:30.867
and they all are gonna have different classes.

234
00:11:30.867 --> 00:11:32.963
Good, so that's enough Javascript for now,

235
00:11:32.963 --> 00:11:36.070
now let's get into the actual CSS of it,

236
00:11:36.070 --> 00:11:40.053
so let's go into our gallery, and we'll display grid

237
00:11:40.053 --> 00:11:44.406
on the actual grid, and again, we need to make it

238
00:11:44.406 --> 00:11:46.823
100 pixels wide for each one.

239
00:11:50.009 --> 00:11:53.585
Oh, somebody at my door, who's there?

240
00:11:53.585 --> 00:11:57.164
Oh, no it was just motion, excuse me.

241
00:11:57.164 --> 00:11:59.132
What were we doing?

242
00:11:59.132 --> 00:12:01.369
Oh yeah, we're making a grid of 100 pixels,

243
00:12:01.369 --> 00:12:03.952
so grid, template, columns, did this 100 times,

244
00:12:03.952 --> 00:12:06.177
and how many do we need?

245
00:12:06.177 --> 00:12:09.030
Well, we don't know, as many as it is wide.

246
00:12:09.030 --> 00:12:11.909
So we can just repeat, autofill,

247
00:12:11.909 --> 00:12:15.987
remember we learned about that, 100 pixels each one, good.

248
00:12:15.987 --> 00:12:18.258
Give that a save and ooh, look what we're

249
00:12:18.258 --> 00:12:19.312
working with so far.

250
00:12:19.312 --> 00:12:23.535
If we inspect element, let's turn on our layout tools

251
00:12:23.535 --> 00:12:24.644
for the gallery.

252
00:12:24.644 --> 00:12:29.111
You can see that there's nine, but if it goes bigger,

253
00:12:29.111 --> 00:12:33.715
10, 11, 12, each one is being slotted into the grid.

254
00:12:33.715 --> 00:12:36.512
So that's our columns, our horizontal,

255
00:12:36.512 --> 00:12:40.679
that we're working with, but we also need the vertical.

256
00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:44.159
Now, the thing about the vertical is we don't know

257
00:12:44.159 --> 00:12:46.382
how many there are going to be vertical,

258
00:12:46.382 --> 00:12:49.203
so instead of explicitly telling it what the rows will be,

259
00:12:49.203 --> 00:12:52.160
we'll just size the automatic rows that get created.

260
00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:55.315
We'll size the implicit, or the auto rows.

261
00:12:55.315 --> 00:12:57.248
So say grid, auto rows,

262
00:12:57.248 --> 00:12:59.844
and that is going to be 100 pixels high.

263
00:12:59.844 --> 00:13:04.011
All right, so now it looks like we're getting somewhere

264
00:13:04.949 --> 00:13:08.291
with this actual grid, as I get bigger and bigger,

265
00:13:08.291 --> 00:13:09.970
each one seems to be taking up,

266
00:13:09.970 --> 00:13:13.610
but now they're also kind of spilling out,

267
00:13:13.610 --> 00:13:17.684
so let's work on actually sizing them first,

268
00:13:17.684 --> 00:13:20.851
so we'll take our base item and we ...

269
00:13:24.423 --> 00:13:27.379
We actually don't need to tell it to by default span

270
00:13:27.379 --> 00:13:30.313
one by one because that's the default of it.

271
00:13:30.313 --> 00:13:34.146
But we'll say any item that has a V two on it,

272
00:13:35.132 --> 00:13:37.627
meaning that it is spanning vertical two,

273
00:13:37.627 --> 00:13:39.294
grid, row, span two.

274
00:13:40.796 --> 00:13:44.296
And now you'll see, let's go and find one.

275
00:13:46.032 --> 00:13:49.369
There's this one right here, the second one,

276
00:13:49.369 --> 00:13:51.202
that was spanning two.

277
00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:53.801
If I hover over top of it,

278
00:13:53.801 --> 00:13:56.472
you'll see that it is now taking up two vertical spots.

279
00:13:56.472 --> 00:13:58.438
You can't see the image taking up two spots.

280
00:13:58.438 --> 00:14:01.604
That's 'cause the images are still spilling out

281
00:14:01.604 --> 00:14:03.659
of each of them, maybe if we did something like this.

282
00:14:03.659 --> 00:14:06.953
Item overflow hidden, maybe that will

283
00:14:06.953 --> 00:14:08.620
work a little bit better, there we go, okay.

284
00:14:08.620 --> 00:14:10.909
So you see that these ones right here

285
00:14:10.909 --> 00:14:14.281
are being too high, and let's just keep going,

286
00:14:14.281 --> 00:14:17.693
doing the rest, so anything that has a V three

287
00:14:17.693 --> 00:14:21.360
is gonna be that, and anything that has four

288
00:14:23.711 --> 00:14:25.577
is going to span four.

289
00:14:25.577 --> 00:14:26.410
Beautiful.

290
00:14:27.574 --> 00:14:30.646
Now let's do that with the horizontal versions as well,

291
00:14:30.646 --> 00:14:31.896
let's see here.

292
00:14:33.836 --> 00:14:36.603
Can we do a little bit of keyboard shortcuts?

293
00:14:36.603 --> 00:14:40.103
Duplicate it all, select that, H ... whoo.

294
00:14:44.064 --> 00:14:45.059
Did that work?

295
00:14:45.059 --> 00:14:47.329
So this one has horizontal two,

296
00:14:47.329 --> 00:14:49.069
oh no, obviously it's not gonna work

297
00:14:49.069 --> 00:14:52.937
'cause it's grid row, not grid column,

298
00:14:52.937 --> 00:14:55.020
so we'll say grid column.

299
00:14:55.858 --> 00:14:58.199
A-ha, now we're getting somewhere.

300
00:14:58.199 --> 00:15:00.524
So we've got all of our items,

301
00:15:00.524 --> 00:15:03.137
they are all being sized appropriately.

302
00:15:03.137 --> 00:15:07.304
The only problem is that we have all of these empty spaces

303
00:15:08.410 --> 00:15:10.048
and that's because by default,

304
00:15:10.048 --> 00:15:13.230
whenever it runs into a spot that it cannot fit,

305
00:15:13.230 --> 00:15:15.197
and let's run through how this works.

306
00:15:15.197 --> 00:15:18.282
That one fits, that one fits, that one fits,

307
00:15:18.282 --> 00:15:20.507
that one fits, but then the next one,

308
00:15:20.507 --> 00:15:25.250
which needs to be four horizontal and two high,

309
00:15:25.250 --> 00:15:27.563
it doesn't fit right here because we only have

310
00:15:27.563 --> 00:15:31.297
three wide and one high, so it just keeps going on

311
00:15:31.297 --> 00:15:33.423
until it finds a spot, and that's here.

312
00:15:33.423 --> 00:15:36.560
And then that space is forever going to be unused

313
00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:40.043
because the browser does not go back to fill it.

314
00:15:40.043 --> 00:15:42.096
So we know how we can fix that.

315
00:15:42.096 --> 00:15:45.005
We'll go back up to our grid here, gallery,

316
00:15:45.005 --> 00:15:49.172
and we'll say grid auto flow, and we'll call it dense.

317
00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:54.125
And then it will start to fill it in

318
00:15:54.125 --> 00:15:56.458
as we have these little one by one-ers,

319
00:15:56.458 --> 00:16:00.499
it'll start to go back and fill in the values as we want,

320
00:16:00.499 --> 00:16:03.647
so that's looking pretty good, but let's take a look.

321
00:16:03.647 --> 00:16:07.914
We start to now have a bunch of little spots

322
00:16:07.914 --> 00:16:10.493
because there just isn't enough of these little

323
00:16:10.493 --> 00:16:14.172
filler one by ones that can fit itself in.

324
00:16:14.172 --> 00:16:16.560
So the first time I did that, I was like aw,

325
00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:18.553
that's kind of a bummer.

326
00:16:18.553 --> 00:16:21.660
I don't know, maybe you could design something cool

327
00:16:21.660 --> 00:16:22.888
that would fit in there, but

328
00:16:22.888 --> 00:16:26.127
if this was like a Wordpress blog where you were having

329
00:16:26.127 --> 00:16:29.294
a bunch of blogposts, what I would do,

330
00:16:30.135 --> 00:16:31.614
and that's what we're gonna do here,

331
00:16:31.614 --> 00:16:33.958
is we're gonna load it up with a bunch of extra

332
00:16:33.958 --> 00:16:37.838
one by ones, so that they'll all fill themselves in

333
00:16:37.838 --> 00:16:41.030
so let's go back to where we generated all this html

334
00:16:41.030 --> 00:16:44.613
in our Javascript, and that was right here.

335
00:16:45.963 --> 00:16:48.638
We're just going to concat an array,

336
00:16:48.638 --> 00:16:50.128
and inside of that array, we're just gonna concat

337
00:16:50.128 --> 00:16:53.092
a bunch of new arrays that are just one by ones,

338
00:16:53.092 --> 00:16:57.500
so take that and doot, doot, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo.

339
00:16:57.500 --> 00:16:59.740
All right, that looks good to me, that should be enough.

340
00:16:59.740 --> 00:17:03.262
And let's see it load, I think I broke it.

341
00:17:03.262 --> 00:17:06.012
Let's open up our dev tools here.

342
00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:11.203
Array dot contact, what am I doing?

343
00:17:11.203 --> 00:17:13.131
Concat, there we go.

344
00:17:13.131 --> 00:17:15.471
Whoa, looking good.

345
00:17:15.471 --> 00:17:17.521
Do we have any holes?

346
00:17:17.521 --> 00:17:19.521
Let's see, looking good.

347
00:17:21.334 --> 00:17:23.270
There's almost too many extras here,

348
00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:25.297
maybe I'll refresh it a couple times.

349
00:17:25.297 --> 00:17:27.776
Yeah, you know what, that's too many extra one by ones,

350
00:17:27.776 --> 00:17:29.759
so in my case, I would ... you could probably also

351
00:17:29.759 --> 00:17:32.467
write some sort of algorithm that would detect

352
00:17:32.467 --> 00:17:35.920
empty holes and fill them as we need it.

353
00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:39.116
There's a couple extra there at the bottom, couple.

354
00:17:39.116 --> 00:17:42.057
Here, maybe I deleted too many.

355
00:17:42.057 --> 00:17:43.850
I don't know, you get the point.

356
00:17:43.850 --> 00:17:46.307
You can sort of play with it and see exactly ...

357
00:17:46.307 --> 00:17:47.684
There, that's looking good to me.

358
00:17:47.684 --> 00:17:50.100
Awesome, so that's the first part of it,

359
00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:53.434
but now we need to write some more CSS

360
00:17:53.434 --> 00:17:55.802
to actually get them clickable

361
00:17:55.802 --> 00:17:58.670
and have this sort of overlay pop-up.

362
00:17:58.670 --> 00:18:00.241
So if you're happy with this,

363
00:18:00.241 --> 00:18:02.545
you can stop this video now and move onto the next one,

364
00:18:02.545 --> 00:18:04.461
but if you'd rather learn a little bit more CSS

365
00:18:04.461 --> 00:18:07.461
and Javascript, then let's keep on trucking.

366
00:18:07.461 --> 00:18:10.017
All right, let's first start, if we look at this here,

367
00:18:10.017 --> 00:18:11.482
let's start with these little overlays,

368
00:18:11.482 --> 00:18:15.265
and also, these images are much better cropped

369
00:18:15.265 --> 00:18:18.688
than they are here, you see here, they're just taking

370
00:18:18.688 --> 00:18:20.084
the top right hand corner of the image

371
00:18:20.084 --> 00:18:23.140
and the rest is spilling out, so we're actually gonna make

372
00:18:23.140 --> 00:18:25.573
each of these individual items a grid as well,

373
00:18:25.573 --> 00:18:28.240
so scroll to your item selector,

374
00:18:29.338 --> 00:18:31.922
and we are going to display grid on it,

375
00:18:31.922 --> 00:18:34.378
and we're just going to make it a one by one grid,

376
00:18:34.378 --> 00:18:36.298
so I'll explain this in a second.

377
00:18:36.298 --> 00:18:39.079
So grid, template, column one,

378
00:18:39.079 --> 00:18:41.579
and grid, template, rows, one.

379
00:18:43.901 --> 00:18:46.810
And what that should do, if I now go and

380
00:18:46.810 --> 00:18:50.576
go to the layout tab and take one of the first ones

381
00:18:50.576 --> 00:18:54.514
and inspect it, it's just a one by one grid

382
00:18:54.514 --> 00:18:56.377
and the reason why I do that is because

383
00:18:56.377 --> 00:19:00.373
CSS Grid is also really good for overlapping elements.

384
00:19:00.373 --> 00:19:03.767
Instead of us using position absolute

385
00:19:03.767 --> 00:19:06.808
in order to overlap our items on top of here,

386
00:19:06.808 --> 00:19:09.972
'cause this yellow little item details,

387
00:19:09.972 --> 00:19:14.007
that needs to be overlapped on top of the image,

388
00:19:14.007 --> 00:19:16.946
so if that was the case, then I'd either have to

389
00:19:16.946 --> 00:19:19.813
make the details or the image, or both of them,

390
00:19:19.813 --> 00:19:23.068
position absolute, and I don't wanna have to do that.

391
00:19:23.068 --> 00:19:24.450
And I'm gonna show you how to do it exactly with

392
00:19:24.450 --> 00:19:26.390
just using CSS grid.

393
00:19:26.390 --> 00:19:29.284
So we'll take our item, let's do the image first,

394
00:19:29.284 --> 00:19:33.451
and we're going to say grid, column, one, negative one,

395
00:19:36.082 --> 00:19:38.337
so span across the entire thing

396
00:19:38.337 --> 00:19:40.773
and the row, also span across the entire thing,

397
00:19:40.773 --> 00:19:43.984
and then we're gonna give the image a width of 100%,

398
00:19:43.984 --> 00:19:48.067
a height of 100%, and now this starts to ...

399
00:19:49.446 --> 00:19:51.570
Oh, this is the wrong one, that's the answer.

400
00:19:51.570 --> 00:19:53.509
Here we go, this is what we're working with.

401
00:19:53.509 --> 00:19:57.249
You see that these images are now being stretched,

402
00:19:57.249 --> 00:20:00.070
so what we can do to that is give ourselves

403
00:20:00.070 --> 00:20:03.607
and object fit, and call it cover,

404
00:20:03.607 --> 00:20:07.032
and that will just, it's sort of like background size cover

405
00:20:07.032 --> 00:20:10.987
where it will trim the left or the top or the bottom

406
00:20:10.987 --> 00:20:13.635
or the left and the right to make sure that it fits

407
00:20:13.635 --> 00:20:15.672
perfectly inside of it, while still showing

408
00:20:15.672 --> 00:20:17.233
as much of the image as we can.

409
00:20:17.233 --> 00:20:19.982
We also have contain in there as well,

410
00:20:19.982 --> 00:20:21.508
but that's not what we're looking for,

411
00:20:21.508 --> 00:20:23.222
'cause that would show the entire image.

412
00:20:23.222 --> 00:20:25.544
So background size cover does work

413
00:20:25.544 --> 00:20:28.920
with the ability to do spanning across, one to one,

414
00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:31.589
but you do also need this 100%, 100%

415
00:20:31.589 --> 00:20:34.400
in order for that to work properly.

416
00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:37.907
Good, then the details, the item overlay,

417
00:20:37.907 --> 00:20:41.331
let's grab that, so the item overlay.

418
00:20:41.331 --> 00:20:44.283
And I'm just gonna say background red.

419
00:20:44.283 --> 00:20:47.827
And you see that the item overlay is sort of

420
00:20:47.827 --> 00:20:52.148
below the actual item, and we want it to overlap

421
00:20:52.148 --> 00:20:55.221
on top of this image, so we're just gonna take this

422
00:20:55.221 --> 00:20:57.676
grid column and grid row details

423
00:20:57.676 --> 00:21:00.104
and put it on the item overlay as well.

424
00:21:00.104 --> 00:21:01.801
And this is something we have not done

425
00:21:01.801 --> 00:21:04.194
in our previous one, and that is the ability

426
00:21:04.194 --> 00:21:06.615
to overlap items on top of each other

427
00:21:06.615 --> 00:21:10.552
if you place them on the same row and column,

428
00:21:10.552 --> 00:21:12.382
they will just overlap each other,

429
00:21:12.382 --> 00:21:14.335
and then Z index comes into play,

430
00:21:14.335 --> 00:21:16.915
and if i wanted this to ... I think I can do

431
00:21:16.915 --> 00:21:19.781
position rel, Z index two,

432
00:21:19.781 --> 00:21:21.507
and that would put the image on top,

433
00:21:21.507 --> 00:21:24.117
but because of source order in html,

434
00:21:24.117 --> 00:21:28.337
the overlay is just fine, so the background red here.

435
00:21:28.337 --> 00:21:32.449
Oh, gotta get rid of this position rel stuff,

436
00:21:32.449 --> 00:21:33.858
that's why that didn't go away.

437
00:21:33.858 --> 00:21:35.785
So we don't actually want background red.

438
00:21:35.785 --> 00:21:38.340
I want my yellow, specific yellow, which is that,

439
00:21:38.340 --> 00:21:43.201
and I'm going to put 32, which is 70% opaque.

440
00:21:43.201 --> 00:21:46.201
This is RRGGBBAA, and that 32 is Hex

441
00:21:48.561 --> 00:21:50.947
for 70% transparent.

442
00:21:50.947 --> 00:21:53.085
Good, I'm happy with that,

443
00:21:53.085 --> 00:21:56.002
let's do position relative on this.

444
00:21:57.133 --> 00:22:00.628
And let's add a little bit of padding, 10 PX,

445
00:22:00.628 --> 00:22:04.406
good, now I want to totally center this button

446
00:22:04.406 --> 00:22:06.487
in the middle, so how can I center something

447
00:22:06.487 --> 00:22:07.481
in the middle?

448
00:22:07.481 --> 00:22:09.204
Actually we don't need this padding

449
00:22:09.204 --> 00:22:10.656
because we're gonna center it,

450
00:22:10.656 --> 00:22:14.823
so let's do display grid on the actual item there,

451
00:22:16.215 --> 00:22:19.524
and you see by default, what is the align items

452
00:22:19.524 --> 00:22:20.692
and justify item?

453
00:22:20.692 --> 00:22:22.232
It's stretch.

454
00:22:22.232 --> 00:22:24.816
So the entire thing ... this actually looks kind of cool.

455
00:22:24.816 --> 00:22:29.424
The entire thing is a button now, which is crazy,

456
00:22:29.424 --> 00:22:31.234
but we want it to just go in the middle, so

457
00:22:31.234 --> 00:22:35.151
we say justify items, and that is the x axis

458
00:22:36.641 --> 00:22:38.593
on the row, and we'll say center,

459
00:22:38.593 --> 00:22:41.531
and that will put the button in the middle of each of them,

460
00:22:41.531 --> 00:22:45.031
and align items, that is along the y axis,

461
00:22:46.222 --> 00:22:49.287
that will center it perfectly for us, good.

462
00:22:49.287 --> 00:22:52.704
Let's also just say item, overlay button,

463
00:22:54.111 --> 00:22:57.778
I realize I'm mixing my Bem and my selector,

464
00:22:59.898 --> 00:23:00.893
so forgive me.

465
00:23:00.893 --> 00:23:03.694
Let's say background none,

466
00:23:03.694 --> 00:23:06.194
border two pixels solid white,

467
00:23:07.745 --> 00:23:10.912
color white, text transform uppercase,

468
00:23:16.022 --> 00:23:19.939
background, let's do a little RGBA values here.

469
00:23:21.002 --> 00:23:25.849
Looking pretty good, maybe a little padding on that.

470
00:23:25.849 --> 00:23:28.766
Five pixels, cool, so we have that.

471
00:23:31.112 --> 00:23:33.369
Now I also want to slide it down,

472
00:23:33.369 --> 00:23:36.442
and the way that we can slide something totally

473
00:23:36.442 --> 00:23:39.942
outside of the item is by using transform.

474
00:23:41.407 --> 00:23:43.789
So we'll go back up to our overlay here,

475
00:23:43.789 --> 00:23:45.456
we'll say transform,

476
00:23:47.711 --> 00:23:52.217
translate y 100%, actually just do 50%,

477
00:23:52.217 --> 00:23:53.913
so you can see what's actually happening here.

478
00:23:53.913 --> 00:23:56.186
50% will bring it down, obviously halfway,

479
00:23:56.186 --> 00:24:00.353
so 100% will bring it just off the actual item.

480
00:24:01.748 --> 00:24:05.665
And then what we can do is say when the item is

481
00:24:07.307 --> 00:24:11.474
hovered, then the item overlay is going to be a transform

482
00:24:14.433 --> 00:24:18.600
of translate Y zero, we'll bring it back to where we are.

483
00:24:20.854 --> 00:24:21.859
So now when I hover over top of it,

484
00:24:21.859 --> 00:24:23.234
they automatically show up,

485
00:24:23.234 --> 00:24:25.861
and if I would like, I can go up to my overlay

486
00:24:25.861 --> 00:24:27.368
and put a transition

487
00:24:27.368 --> 00:24:31.368
zero point five seconds, or something like that,

488
00:24:32.448 --> 00:24:35.384
and that will animate it up, that's too slow.

489
00:24:35.384 --> 00:24:37.080
Zero point two seconds.

490
00:24:37.080 --> 00:24:40.346
Whoo, all right, we're in business now.

491
00:24:40.346 --> 00:24:43.830
I think that's all the CSS we have for overlapping

492
00:24:43.830 --> 00:24:45.854
and overlaying things on it.

493
00:24:45.854 --> 00:24:48.703
Now let's go down to the script tags

494
00:24:48.703 --> 00:24:49.915
and write a little bit of Javascript

495
00:24:49.915 --> 00:24:52.232
so when somebody clicks one of these items,

496
00:24:52.232 --> 00:24:54.649
we can then show the overlay.

497
00:24:56.037 --> 00:24:58.859
So gonna go down here and the reason why I'm going to

498
00:24:58.859 --> 00:25:01.724
select these elements after they've been created

499
00:25:01.724 --> 00:25:05.237
is because otherwise, I have to get into event delegation,

500
00:25:05.237 --> 00:25:07.933
and I've got videos on that in my Javascript 30,

501
00:25:07.933 --> 00:25:08.937
but I'm not gonna do it here.

502
00:25:08.937 --> 00:25:11.053
So I'll say const items is equal to document

503
00:25:11.053 --> 00:25:13.720
dot query selector all dot item.

504
00:25:14.778 --> 00:25:16.971
Then we'll take each of the items,

505
00:25:16.971 --> 00:25:19.595
and we'll loop over it, and we'll say

506
00:25:19.595 --> 00:25:23.333
for each item, item dot add event listener,

507
00:25:23.333 --> 00:25:24.831
we're gonna listen for a click,

508
00:25:24.831 --> 00:25:27.127
and then when that happens, we're going to handle

509
00:25:27.127 --> 00:25:29.184
the click, so we need to make a function

510
00:25:29.184 --> 00:25:30.409
called handle click.

511
00:25:30.409 --> 00:25:31.776
Let's do that up here.

512
00:25:31.776 --> 00:25:34.456
Function handle click, takes in the event

513
00:25:34.456 --> 00:25:38.623
and let's just console log the event dot current target.

514
00:25:40.362 --> 00:25:44.637
So open up dev tools here, go to our console,

515
00:25:44.637 --> 00:25:46.649
and now when you click on an item,

516
00:25:46.649 --> 00:25:49.946
we'll see that specific item that we have.

517
00:25:49.946 --> 00:25:52.870
Now inside of that, we need a couple things.

518
00:25:52.870 --> 00:25:55.978
First we need the actual source of the image,

519
00:25:55.978 --> 00:25:57.930
so if we click on the item,

520
00:25:57.930 --> 00:25:59.785
we want the image one dot jpeg,

521
00:25:59.785 --> 00:26:04.036
so in here, we'll say const SRC is equal to E

522
00:26:04.036 --> 00:26:07.574
dot current target dot query selector,

523
00:26:07.574 --> 00:26:10.385
we'll look inside of that for the image tag,

524
00:26:10.385 --> 00:26:12.307
and then we'll grab the source attribute right

525
00:26:12.307 --> 00:26:14.244
off of that image tag, so

526
00:26:14.244 --> 00:26:16.100
we have the image, we look for the image ...

527
00:26:16.100 --> 00:26:17.460
Sorry, we have the item,

528
00:26:17.460 --> 00:26:20.306
we look for the image tag, and then we grab the

529
00:26:20.306 --> 00:26:22.275
source attribute right off of that,

530
00:26:22.275 --> 00:26:24.816
and I can console log the source now.

531
00:26:24.816 --> 00:26:26.483
Top of that, so see.

532
00:26:29.398 --> 00:26:32.958
Beautiful, I'm getting all of my jpegs,

533
00:26:32.958 --> 00:26:35.708
now we can take our overlay image

534
00:26:37.052 --> 00:26:38.991
and set the source of that to be

535
00:26:38.991 --> 00:26:40.930
the source that we just pulled, and

536
00:26:40.930 --> 00:26:41.985
what is the overlay image?

537
00:26:41.985 --> 00:26:43.859
That is, we scroll to the top here,

538
00:26:43.859 --> 00:26:47.662
that is this empty image that currently

539
00:26:47.662 --> 00:26:52.275
does not have a source, but will also be showing it.

540
00:26:52.275 --> 00:26:54.066
Good, I'm happy with that.

541
00:26:54.066 --> 00:26:56.175
Now the last thing we wanna do is

542
00:26:56.175 --> 00:27:00.030
have the ability to open the entire overlay.

543
00:27:00.030 --> 00:27:04.081
And you'll see that if the overlay has a class of open,

544
00:27:04.081 --> 00:27:06.602
it is display gridded.

545
00:27:06.602 --> 00:27:09.681
Otherwise, it is display none-d.

546
00:27:09.681 --> 00:27:11.168
That's what I've done here.

547
00:27:11.168 --> 00:27:14.918
So we will make another function called open.

548
00:27:16.872 --> 00:27:20.254
And in that function it'll just say overlay dot class list

549
00:27:20.254 --> 00:27:21.421
dot add, open.

550
00:27:23.988 --> 00:27:26.696
And we'll make a function called close,

551
00:27:26.696 --> 00:27:29.335
which will do the opposite of this.

552
00:27:29.335 --> 00:27:32.585
Good, then inside of this handle click,

553
00:27:33.819 --> 00:27:36.069
we'll just simply say open,

554
00:27:36.980 --> 00:27:39.559
actually, we don't need an entire open function for this.

555
00:27:39.559 --> 00:27:42.400
Let's just put this in here, good.

556
00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:44.233
Then, when I click it,

557
00:27:45.209 --> 00:27:46.934
whoa, looking good-ish.

558
00:27:46.934 --> 00:27:49.287
So that did pop it up for us.

559
00:27:49.287 --> 00:27:51.617
Seems like that image is a little bit big.

560
00:27:51.617 --> 00:27:53.770
The close button doesn't work, so let's wire up

561
00:27:53.770 --> 00:27:55.664
that close button first, and we'll figure out

562
00:27:55.664 --> 00:27:57.652
what's going on with the CSS here.

563
00:27:57.652 --> 00:28:01.819
So we'll say overlay close dot add event listener,

564
00:28:02.822 --> 00:28:05.128
click, and when someone clicks it, we're gonna

565
00:28:05.128 --> 00:28:06.355
run the close function.

566
00:28:06.355 --> 00:28:10.272
Open it up, click the close, nope, not working.

567
00:28:11.744 --> 00:28:12.942
Any errors?

568
00:28:12.942 --> 00:28:16.918
Go to our console, class list dot close.

569
00:28:16.918 --> 00:28:18.501
What am I doing?

570
00:28:18.501 --> 00:28:19.621
Do I even know?

571
00:28:19.621 --> 00:28:21.941
Remove, you're probably screaming at me.

572
00:28:21.941 --> 00:28:22.984
There we go, open it up,

573
00:28:22.984 --> 00:28:26.068
close works just beautifully.

574
00:28:26.068 --> 00:28:27.734
You can also hook that function up to run

575
00:28:27.734 --> 00:28:30.171
when somebody hits the escape key.

576
00:28:30.171 --> 00:28:32.835
We've done that a couple times in my Javascript 30.

577
00:28:32.835 --> 00:28:35.678
So view that, good, and let's just take a quick look at

578
00:28:35.678 --> 00:28:38.511
what's going on with this overlay.

579
00:28:40.467 --> 00:28:43.177
Over, overlay inner ...

580
00:28:43.177 --> 00:28:45.510
Let's take a look at my CSS.

581
00:28:46.514 --> 00:28:48.640
Oh, it's 'cause I had a figure.

582
00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:52.223
Gonna change this to overlay inner instead.

583
00:28:59.201 --> 00:29:02.631
Beautiful, one other thing is it's actually not centered

584
00:29:02.631 --> 00:29:06.348
here, so what we can do is go back to our overlay

585
00:29:06.348 --> 00:29:08.598
and go say when it is open,

586
00:29:11.999 --> 00:29:14.221
we're gonna display grid, and then we're just gonna say

587
00:29:14.221 --> 00:29:17.971
align items center, and justify items center.

588
00:29:19.453 --> 00:29:20.794
You see how we do that quite a bit?

589
00:29:20.794 --> 00:29:23.289
Open it up, whoo, look at that, beautiful.

590
00:29:23.289 --> 00:29:25.840
I can't see the close button anymore, so

591
00:29:25.840 --> 00:29:30.007
go up to our dot close selector and color should be black.

592
00:29:34.943 --> 00:29:38.433
View, beautiful, looking good to me.

593
00:29:38.433 --> 00:29:39.775
I'm a big fan of that.

594
00:29:39.775 --> 00:29:43.192
Cool, so that is our very simple CSS grid

595
00:29:44.317 --> 00:29:46.538
image gallery using object fit dense.

596
00:29:46.538 --> 00:29:47.950
Hopefully you learned a few things.

597
00:29:47.950 --> 00:29:50.677
I especially liked the overlapping part.

598
00:29:50.677 --> 00:29:53.210
I use that a lot with CSS Grid to overlap items

599
00:29:53.210 --> 00:29:54.537
on top of it.

600
00:29:54.537 --> 00:29:57.787
Good job, I'll see you in the next one.
