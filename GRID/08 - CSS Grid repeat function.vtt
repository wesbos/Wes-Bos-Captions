(funky tune)

2
00:00:03.877 --> 00:00:07.077
<v Wes>So let's open up the CSS Grid repeat function.</v>

3
00:00:07.077 --> 00:00:10.465
One's that we have here and let's do a quick little grid

4
00:00:10.465 --> 00:00:11.772
where we have four columns.

5
00:00:11.772 --> 00:00:14.093
So how I would normally do that is something

6
00:00:14.093 --> 00:00:17.622
like grid template columns 1fr, four times.

7
00:00:17.622 --> 00:00:19.133
And that gives us.

8
00:00:19.133 --> 00:00:20.396
Oh, I forgot one!

9
00:00:20.396 --> 00:00:21.229
Four!

10
00:00:21.229 --> 00:00:22.062
There we go.

11
00:00:22.062 --> 00:00:26.106
That gives us four columns, each 20 pixels spaced apart.

12
00:00:26.106 --> 00:00:27.738
Now what I can do instead of that is

13
00:00:27.738 --> 00:00:29.496
instead of writing 1fr four times,

14
00:00:29.496 --> 00:00:31.418
I just type the repeat function.

15
00:00:31.418 --> 00:00:32.598
And the repeat function takes two things.

16
00:00:32.598 --> 00:00:33.728
First, how many times you want to repeat it.

17
00:00:33.728 --> 00:00:34.561
Four.

18
00:00:34.561 --> 00:00:36.942
And what you would like to repeat, 1fr.

19
00:00:36.942 --> 00:00:38.619
And that gives us the exact same thing.

20
00:00:38.619 --> 00:00:41.029
What's so neat about this is, is you can actually pass it

21
00:00:41.029 --> 00:00:42.256
something like 2fr.

22
00:00:42.256 --> 00:00:45.239
And this is going to give us eight columns.

23
00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:46.547
And that's going to alternate

24
00:00:46.547 --> 00:00:49.408
between 1fr, 2fr, 1fr, 2fr, right?

25
00:00:49.408 --> 00:00:52.672
Because it just takes whatever you have right here

26
00:00:52.672 --> 00:00:54.678
and multiplies it by four.

27
00:00:54.678 --> 00:00:58.671
So you could also throw maybe throw like an auto in here.

28
00:00:58.671 --> 00:01:00.997
And that will just auto size the columns based

29
00:01:00.997 --> 00:01:02.059
on their content.

30
00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:03.489
You can also just mix and match it

31
00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:06.041
with values that you pass in here.

32
00:01:06.041 --> 00:01:08.039
So maybe I wanna start it with 100 pixels

33
00:01:08.039 --> 00:01:09.506
and end it with 200 pixels.

34
00:01:09.506 --> 00:01:13.389
And then inside of it I just wanna repeat this 1fr twice.

35
00:01:13.389 --> 00:01:14.576
And then auto twice.

36
00:01:14.576 --> 00:01:18.727
You'll see that we have one, two, three, four,

37
00:01:18.727 --> 00:01:21.168
five, six columns being added.

38
00:01:21.168 --> 00:01:23.624
And of course you can add more repeats on here as well.

39
00:01:23.624 --> 00:01:27.817
Maybe I want to end it off with a repeat off 5fr.

40
00:01:27.817 --> 00:01:30.142
And that will give us all kinds of columns.

41
00:01:30.142 --> 00:01:33.130
So the repeat function can really just be used anywhere

42
00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:35.290
inside of our grid template columns

43
00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:36.804
or our grid template rows.

44
00:01:36.804 --> 00:01:40.151
To just cut down on the amount of typing that we need to do.

45
00:01:40.151 --> 00:01:42.568
