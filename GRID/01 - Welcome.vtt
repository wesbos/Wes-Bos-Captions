<v ->Hey everybody, Wes Bos here.</v>

3
00:00:05.107 --> 00:00:07.244
Thanks so much for checking out CSS Grid.

4
00:00:07.244 --> 00:00:09.049
A couple things before we get going.

5
00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:10.997
First, thank you so much to Firefox

6
00:00:10.997 --> 00:00:13.267
for sponsoring this course.

7
00:00:13.267 --> 00:00:14.715
The reason why they are free is

8
00:00:14.715 --> 00:00:17.056
because they have sponsored my time

9
00:00:17.056 --> 00:00:18.204
in order to create them.

10
00:00:18.204 --> 00:00:19.569
We're gonna be using their dev tools

11
00:00:19.569 --> 00:00:20.775
all throughout this course

12
00:00:20.775 --> 00:00:22.417
because they are fantastic

13
00:00:22.417 --> 00:00:24.480
when dealing with CSS Grid.

14
00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.794
A couple other things to get the most out of this course.

15
00:00:26.794 --> 00:00:28.639
All the videos are captioned,

16
00:00:28.639 --> 00:00:30.666
so if you like captions on your videos,

17
00:00:30.666 --> 00:00:32.194
if you need the captions on your videos,

18
00:00:32.194 --> 00:00:33.424
make sure you turn those on

19
00:00:33.424 --> 00:00:36.201
and you'll be able to read what I'm saying

20
00:00:36.201 --> 00:00:39.291
at the same time that I'm speaking through it.

21
00:00:39.291 --> 00:00:42.202
Second, post your progress on Twitter and Facebook.

22
00:00:42.202 --> 00:00:44.399
I always like to see how far people are getting

23
00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:45.946
through the course, what they've learned,

24
00:00:45.946 --> 00:00:47.882
what they really enjoyed, what they didn't like.

25
00:00:47.882 --> 00:00:51.315
I'm @wesbos on Twitter and the hashtag for this course

26
00:00:51.315 --> 00:00:56.254
is #GRIDDYUP, G-R-I-D-D-Y-U-P.

27
00:00:56.254 --> 00:00:57.484
What else we got here.

28
00:00:57.484 --> 00:00:58.820
Pay it forward.

29
00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.608
What we really need in terms of the

30
00:01:01.608 --> 00:01:04.018
CSS Grid on the internet is lots and lots of content

31
00:01:04.018 --> 00:01:04.926
out there.

32
00:01:04.926 --> 00:01:07.523
So whether you're writing a review of this course

33
00:01:07.523 --> 00:01:09.654
or writing summaries of each of the videos

34
00:01:09.654 --> 00:01:12.456
or just creating your own CSS Grid content on your blog

35
00:01:12.456 --> 00:01:14.958
or on YouTube, whatever it is,

36
00:01:14.958 --> 00:01:18.452
I encourage you to do that and share what you've learned

37
00:01:18.452 --> 00:01:20.520
with the rest of the people.

38
00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.560
If you would like to link back to them,

39
00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.339
there's a list in the README on GitHub for this.

40
00:01:25.339 --> 00:01:27.168
You can send a pull request to link off

41
00:01:27.168 --> 00:01:29.558
to your blog or to your YouTube videos.

42
00:01:29.558 --> 00:01:31.825
In terms of how should you do these videos,

43
00:01:31.825 --> 00:01:33.475
that's totally up to you.

44
00:01:33.475 --> 00:01:36.129
Some people like to watch them all at first

45
00:01:36.129 --> 00:01:40.123
and then try to do the exercises and things that we've done.

46
00:01:40.123 --> 00:01:42.585
Some people to prefer to watch them first

47
00:01:42.585 --> 00:01:45.010
and then watch 'em again and code along with me.

48
00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:47.131
And other people prefer just to code along

49
00:01:47.131 --> 00:01:48.550
with me as I'm doing it.

50
00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:49.976
So try a couple different ways

51
00:01:49.976 --> 00:01:52.167
and see what works best for you.

52
00:01:52.167 --> 00:01:54.301
Other than that, make sure you go ahead

53
00:01:54.301 --> 00:01:57.058
and grab a friend if you're someone who likes to

54
00:01:57.058 --> 00:01:59.335
take these courses with someone else,

55
00:01:59.335 --> 00:02:00.863
maybe have a bit of a support system.

56
00:02:00.863 --> 00:02:02.145
An 'accountabilibuddy',

57
00:02:02.145 --> 00:02:03.961
we called them in the JavaScript 30 course.

58
00:02:03.961 --> 00:02:07.132
Make sure you grab someone and maybe meet up for coffee

59
00:02:07.132 --> 00:02:09.807
a couple times a week and go through them together.

60
00:02:09.807 --> 00:02:11.182
Other than that, I hope you enjoy the course

61
00:02:11.182 --> 00:02:13.849
and I'll see ya in the next one.
