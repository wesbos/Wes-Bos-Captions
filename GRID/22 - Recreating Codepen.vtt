00:00:00.569 --> 00:00:03.693
(abrupt loud guitar)

2
00:00:03.693 --> 00:00:06.456
<v Narrator>One really nice thing that CSS grid is good for</v>

3
00:00:06.456 --> 00:00:09.260
is when you have an application rather than a website.

4
00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:12.449
And I mean that, like when the entire browser

5
00:00:12.449 --> 00:00:16.332
is multiple windows sometimes you got scrolling

6
00:00:16.332 --> 00:00:18.390
and you got different parts and pieces

7
00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.753
and it all needs to fit into

8
00:00:20.753 --> 00:00:23.161
however big the actual view port is.

9
00:00:23.161 --> 00:00:25.305
And CodePen is a great example of this,

10
00:00:25.305 --> 00:00:27.114
where you've got your title,

11
00:00:27.114 --> 00:00:29.759
you've got all these different places to write your code,

12
00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:31.112
you have a preview window,

13
00:00:31.112 --> 00:00:32.449
you've got some settings down here.

14
00:00:32.449 --> 00:00:35.107
So, what we're going to be doing in this exercise

15
00:00:35.107 --> 00:00:37.861
is creating CodePen from scratch.

16
00:00:37.861 --> 00:00:41.111
So I've started you off with some HTML.

17
00:00:41.111 --> 00:00:44.012
And the idea behind the HTML,

18
00:00:44.012 --> 00:00:47.496
let's do a quick inspect element on this,

19
00:00:47.496 --> 00:00:49.334
is that it's four main parts.

20
00:00:49.334 --> 00:00:51.741
So if you look we have a div of the class of CodePen

21
00:00:51.741 --> 00:00:52.709
that's the entire thing.

22
00:00:52.709 --> 00:00:55.452
And then inside of that we have our pen

23
00:00:55.452 --> 00:00:57.634
which is sort of the header,

24
00:00:57.634 --> 00:01:00.005
we have the code which is the the three panes,

25
00:01:00.005 --> 00:01:03.042
the preview which is like just an iFrame to preview it,

26
00:01:03.042 --> 00:01:06.188
and the settings which is the little bar at the bottom here.

27
00:01:06.188 --> 00:01:07.898
And then inside of each of those

28
00:01:07.898 --> 00:01:11.162
they are all their sort of smaller subset grids.

29
00:01:11.162 --> 00:01:15.325
So if this is something you would like to maybe try yourself

30
00:01:15.325 --> 00:01:17.965
please go ahead and give it a shot.

31
00:01:17.965 --> 00:01:20.983
I did do it entirely in CSS grid

32
00:01:20.983 --> 00:01:22.616
though there's a lot of use cases

33
00:01:22.616 --> 00:01:25.338
where you could use FlexBox as well.

34
00:01:25.338 --> 00:01:27.806
So let's open up style-START

35
00:01:27.806 --> 00:01:28.951
if you're going to go ahead with me.

36
00:01:28.951 --> 00:01:30.938
And I've provided you with very minimal

37
00:01:30.938 --> 00:01:33.658
there's no grid stuff this is just sort of your base

38
00:01:33.658 --> 00:01:37.663
setting the font size and the color and whatnot.

39
00:01:37.663 --> 00:01:40.492
So going to open this one up, CodePen start.

40
00:01:40.492 --> 00:01:42.567
Good, so this is what we're looking at

41
00:01:42.567 --> 00:01:46.137
and let's actually go ahead and start with the main CodePen

42
00:01:46.137 --> 00:01:48.196
and we're going to dice it up into different pieces.

43
00:01:48.196 --> 00:01:51.454
So how big are these things going to be?

44
00:01:51.454 --> 00:01:54.308
Well the four different pieces are,

45
00:01:54.308 --> 00:01:57.808
I want the header to take up as much room as it needs.

46
00:01:57.808 --> 00:02:01.262
I want the footer to take up as much room as it needs.

47
00:02:01.262 --> 00:02:03.550
And then these two ones I just want to sort of

48
00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:05.480
split the difference between the two.

49
00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:09.658
And real CodePen you're able to resize it and whatnot

50
00:02:09.658 --> 00:02:11.094
cause they use some JavaScript.

51
00:02:11.094 --> 00:02:13.796
But I did my best with just CSS,

52
00:02:13.796 --> 00:02:16.446
it's as far as I could get it and there's no vertical resize

53
00:02:16.446 --> 00:02:18.564
but if you'd like to add some JavaScript you can.

54
00:02:18.564 --> 00:02:20.921
So we're going to grab our CodePen,

55
00:02:20.921 --> 00:02:24.305
and we're going to display grid on that.

56
00:02:24.305 --> 00:02:27.007
Then we need to cut it up into the four different pieces

57
00:02:27.007 --> 00:02:28.746
and in this case it's not actually columns

58
00:02:28.746 --> 00:02:30.018
it's going to be rows.

59
00:02:30.018 --> 00:02:32.185
So GTR grid template rows,

60
00:02:33.108 --> 00:02:36.446
and we want it to be auto, the first one to be auto size.

61
00:02:36.446 --> 00:02:39.174
The next one to be 1fr, the next one 1fr and then auto.

62
00:02:39.174 --> 00:02:40.958
And what that should do,

63
00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:42.574
it's a little bit hard to see it.

64
00:02:42.574 --> 00:02:45.655
So first we're going to have to be closing our dev tools

65
00:02:45.655 --> 00:02:48.402
so we can get the full look of what it's like.

66
00:02:48.402 --> 00:02:50.468
And then we'll also take our CodePen

67
00:02:50.468 --> 00:02:53.178
each of the direct descendants each of the items

68
00:02:53.178 --> 00:02:55.887
and we'll just put a border one pixel of black

69
00:02:55.887 --> 00:02:58.481
just so we can see where each of the items is.

70
00:02:58.481 --> 00:03:02.326
Now this is not working because shouldn't this code

71
00:03:02.326 --> 00:03:05.462
assets and commands, shouldn't that be at the bottom?

72
00:03:05.462 --> 00:03:08.167
And that's because the CodePen doesn't have a height on it

73
00:03:08.167 --> 00:03:11.025
and you need an explicit height in order for it to work.

74
00:03:11.025 --> 00:03:11.858
So what we're going to do is

75
00:03:11.858 --> 00:03:14.495
we're going to put a height on it.

76
00:03:14.495 --> 00:03:17.171
And the height of that is just going to be 100vh,

77
00:03:17.171 --> 00:03:21.208
which is the view port height that will be 100 percent high.

78
00:03:21.208 --> 00:03:23.227
And we give that a save view you'll now see that

79
00:03:23.227 --> 00:03:25.176
it's sticking to the bottom sticking to the top.

80
00:03:25.176 --> 00:03:27.924
And then the difference between the two are then split.

81
00:03:27.924 --> 00:03:29.114
Now let's move on.

82
00:03:29.114 --> 00:03:33.525
Let's do this right here which is the editors that we have.

83
00:03:33.525 --> 00:03:36.373
So that has a class of code on it.

84
00:03:36.373 --> 00:03:39.586
And we can inspect element real quick on that.

85
00:03:39.586 --> 00:03:41.774
See we have div with a class of code.

86
00:03:41.774 --> 00:03:43.903
And then we have three items which is editor, editor, editor

87
00:03:43.903 --> 00:03:45.988
for each multi ss and JavaScript.

88
00:03:45.988 --> 00:03:48.304
So we can display grid on that.

89
00:03:48.304 --> 00:03:51.531
And then we will equally size them

90
00:03:51.531 --> 00:03:55.698
with grid template columns and we'll repeat 3 1fr.

91
00:03:58.134 --> 00:03:59.988
And that will put them all side by side.

92
00:03:59.988 --> 00:04:01.374
Good I'm pretty happy with that.

93
00:04:01.374 --> 00:04:05.017
Now let's move up to this head right here.

94
00:04:05.017 --> 00:04:07.813
So header with a class of pen.

95
00:04:07.813 --> 00:04:09.928
So we'll go down here .pen,

96
00:04:09.928 --> 00:04:13.538
and we need...let's look at what the different pieces

97
00:04:13.538 --> 00:04:15.372
of code are inside of it.

98
00:04:15.372 --> 00:04:18.801
We've got the pen details and beside that we have

99
00:04:18.801 --> 00:04:21.199
a bunch of buttons, and this is very similar

100
00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:22.513
to the one that we looked at earlier

101
00:04:22.513 --> 00:04:25.693
when we looked at the FlexBox versus the grid.

102
00:04:25.693 --> 00:04:28.804
And what the pen details take up as much room as it can

103
00:04:28.804 --> 00:04:32.592
minus whatever size the buttons and the avatar are in.

104
00:04:32.592 --> 00:04:34.925
So display grid right there.

105
00:04:36.588 --> 00:04:38.755
Grid template columns 1fr,

106
00:04:41.192 --> 00:04:45.084
we'll do the same thing that we did previously.

107
00:04:45.084 --> 00:04:47.584
And then grid autoflow column.

108
00:04:51.985 --> 00:04:53.891
And what that will do is it will stick

109
00:04:53.891 --> 00:04:56.374
all the additional items to the right there.

110
00:04:56.374 --> 00:04:57.904
Now these are being stretched,

111
00:04:57.904 --> 00:04:59.631
the image is not being stretched

112
00:04:59.631 --> 00:05:01.964
so we can align items center

113
00:05:03.424 --> 00:05:06.839
and that will get us in a good spot for there.

114
00:05:06.839 --> 00:05:08.622
We'll deal with some...

115
00:05:08.622 --> 00:05:09.455
Here I'll put a little bit of grid gap on there as well 10px

116
00:05:09.455 --> 00:05:11.955
bump them off from each other.

117
00:05:13.426 --> 00:05:14.559
Good, I'm really happy with that.

118
00:05:14.559 --> 00:05:17.892
So that was the header, we did the code.

119
00:05:20.359 --> 00:05:23.099
The preview we need we've got an iFrame in here

120
00:05:23.099 --> 00:05:27.033
we want that to sort of span the entire place.

121
00:05:27.033 --> 00:05:31.568
And all we need for that is preview display grid.

122
00:05:31.568 --> 00:05:34.210
And by default it will be one column by one column

123
00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:37.139
and the default item is stretched so there's nothing else

124
00:05:37.139 --> 00:05:40.125
that we need to do for that specific one.

125
00:05:40.125 --> 00:05:43.293
And then the settings here there's no need to do the grid.

126
00:05:43.293 --> 00:05:47.362
So good, we just did the entire layout here

127
00:05:47.362 --> 00:05:50.724
by just saying grid three times and laying them out.

128
00:05:50.724 --> 00:05:53.796
Now let's go to get into each of the individual ones,

129
00:05:53.796 --> 00:05:56.271
and start working with it so.

130
00:05:56.271 --> 00:05:58.238
Let's start at the top here

131
00:05:58.238 --> 00:06:01.938
and start some styling on Some Amazing Pen name.

132
00:06:01.938 --> 00:06:03.942
And that again, that is our pen.

133
00:06:03.942 --> 00:06:06.109
We'll do background black,

134
00:06:07.224 --> 00:06:09.224
border bottom 5px solid.

135
00:06:12.371 --> 00:06:15.621
And the CodePen color is 3,4, 3,4, 3,6.

136
00:06:18.928 --> 00:06:21.568
And that's actually a color we use fairly often

137
00:06:21.568 --> 00:06:25.400
so let's put that into a variable called gray.

138
00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:28.680
And then let's go up to the top here,

139
00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:32.847
on the root selector and set the variable gray to be that.

140
00:06:35.323 --> 00:06:38.990
Did I spell that wrong g-r-e-y g-r-e-y good.

141
00:06:40.114 --> 00:06:42.785
In Canada sometimes they spell it with an A.

142
00:06:42.785 --> 00:06:45.317
And a padding of 10px on that header.

143
00:06:45.317 --> 00:06:48.067
Good now header's looking in pretty good shape,

144
00:06:48.067 --> 00:06:49.991
I'm pretty happy with that it's all nicely aligned.

145
00:06:49.991 --> 00:06:53.074
Let's go ahead and style the buttons,

146
00:06:55.513 --> 00:06:57.559
and they each have a class of button.

147
00:06:57.559 --> 00:07:01.136
So the background of each of our buttons is going to be

148
00:07:01.136 --> 00:07:03.636
the variable gray border zero,

149
00:07:08.795 --> 00:07:10.878
color white padding 10px,

150
00:07:15.029 --> 00:07:17.362
and a border radius of 10px.

151
00:07:20.469 --> 00:07:22.886
no that's too much, 5px good.

152
00:07:24.918 --> 00:07:26.918
And a font size of 15px.

153
00:07:28.988 --> 00:07:31.304
Awesome, looking pretty pretty good to me.

154
00:07:31.304 --> 00:07:33.714
We also have the concept of small buttons down here.

155
00:07:33.714 --> 00:07:35.157
So what I'm going to do that

156
00:07:35.157 --> 00:07:39.241
is say anything with a button that has a small on it

157
00:07:39.241 --> 00:07:41.682
we're simply just going to change the font size to 12,

158
00:07:41.682 --> 00:07:43.765
and make the padding 4px.

159
00:07:44.684 --> 00:07:46.848
Okay we've got these little buttons down here,

160
00:07:46.848 --> 00:07:48.062
and these little buttons here,

161
00:07:48.062 --> 00:07:51.117
and then these are our regular large buttons.

162
00:07:51.117 --> 00:07:54.480
Good, also this button right here has a class

163
00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:57.293
of dirty on it if you look at the answer here,

164
00:07:57.293 --> 00:07:59.850
it'll give us this little (sliding voop sound).

165
00:07:59.850 --> 00:08:04.831
So what we can do is select a button that has a dirty state.

166
00:08:04.831 --> 00:08:09.192
And in order to get this little line right here,

167
00:08:09.192 --> 00:08:12.596
what I've done is I've used a before attribute.

168
00:08:12.596 --> 00:08:16.715
So we'll say before and the background after that

169
00:08:16.715 --> 00:08:18.548
is going to be yellow,

170
00:08:19.557 --> 00:08:21.390
It's my yellow ffc600.

171
00:08:23.199 --> 00:08:24.620
And we'll do the whole song and dance

172
00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:27.226
if you've used a before before.

173
00:08:27.226 --> 00:08:30.891
So let's say display block content nothing

174
00:08:30.891 --> 00:08:35.341
height 2px, width it's going to be a 100 percent.

175
00:08:35.341 --> 00:08:37.279
But we don't want it to go all the way across.

176
00:08:37.279 --> 00:08:39.576
Here let's actually look at what we're dealing with there.

177
00:08:39.576 --> 00:08:41.988
It looks pretty good.

178
00:08:41.988 --> 00:08:45.460
But we're going to make it position absolute,

179
00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:49.055
and from the left it's going to be 3px.

180
00:08:49.055 --> 00:08:50.679
So now we run into a bit an issue where it's going

181
00:08:50.679 --> 00:08:53.592
all the way across so we back up to our button,

182
00:08:53.592 --> 00:08:55.471
and make that position relative

183
00:08:55.471 --> 00:08:57.203
and that will put it inside of it.

184
00:08:57.203 --> 00:09:01.370
But the problem is that if the button is a 100 percent wide

185
00:09:03.587 --> 00:09:05.487
then it goes all the way across.

186
00:09:05.487 --> 00:09:08.312
But we want it to go start from three pixels over.

187
00:09:08.312 --> 00:09:11.716
So really we want it 100 pixels less six,

188
00:09:11.716 --> 00:09:13.808
three pixels on each side.

189
00:09:13.808 --> 00:09:17.975
So we can use calc for that, so 100 percent minus 6px.

190
00:09:19.370 --> 00:09:21.250
Looking good.

191
00:09:21.250 --> 00:09:23.583
And then on top 3px as well.

192
00:09:25.124 --> 00:09:26.805
Good, I'm happy with that.

193
00:09:26.805 --> 00:09:29.500
Now let's move on these editors here.

194
00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:33.440
Each editor in itself we open some of those up,

195
00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:36.191
but not the code go into the editor.

196
00:09:36.191 --> 00:09:39.168
The editor header itself needs to be side by side.

197
00:09:39.168 --> 00:09:41.618
See if you look at this editor header we've got

198
00:09:41.618 --> 00:09:43.641
the little drop down on the right,

199
00:09:43.641 --> 00:09:46.356
whereas the rest of the items are over here.

200
00:09:46.356 --> 00:09:50.867
So the way we can do that is grab the editor header,

201
00:09:50.867 --> 00:09:52.617
display grid on that.

202
00:09:53.953 --> 00:09:58.195
And we will give ourselves three columns,

203
00:09:58.195 --> 00:09:59.695
Auto 1fr and auto.

204
00:10:01.875 --> 00:10:03.645
And what that should do

205
00:10:03.645 --> 00:10:06.312
is the middle item here the CSS,

206
00:10:07.453 --> 00:10:09.345
that will span as wide as it needs to

207
00:10:09.345 --> 00:10:11.400
less the size of the button,

208
00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:14.233
buttons on the right and the left.

209
00:10:15.126 --> 00:10:16.959
Good but I don't want the buttons,

210
00:10:16.959 --> 00:10:18.933
the buttons are currently now stretching

211
00:10:18.933 --> 00:10:23.576
so how do I do that, we'll justify items center,

212
00:10:23.576 --> 00:10:25.581
no that's not what I wanted.

213
00:10:25.581 --> 00:10:28.058
It's align items center.

214
00:10:28.058 --> 00:10:30.202
There we go they're no longer stretching.

215
00:10:30.202 --> 00:10:32.337
Put a little bit of padding on the header,

216
00:10:32.337 --> 00:10:33.754
5px looking good.

217
00:10:35.204 --> 00:10:38.954
And we'll also put some grid gap 5px on that.

218
00:10:41.858 --> 00:10:43.610
Good now just a little bit of color.

219
00:10:43.610 --> 00:10:47.027
Background is going to be RGBA 0,0,0,0.1.

220
00:10:49.717 --> 00:10:50.845
And what's that's going to do

221
00:10:50.845 --> 00:10:52.383
is it's going to sort of see through whatever

222
00:10:52.383 --> 00:10:55.321
the actual background of the editor is.

223
00:10:55.321 --> 00:10:58.158
So let's go back up to maybe we'll put the selector

224
00:10:58.158 --> 00:11:01.741
with our editor so we don't get too gnarly.

225
00:11:02.798 --> 00:11:06.548
Where did our editor, oh it's the code here's

226
00:11:09.359 --> 00:11:12.442
editor pen header, put that in there.

227
00:11:15.895 --> 00:11:19.530
Now each of our code blocks the background to that.

228
00:11:19.530 --> 00:11:22.784
It's going to be # and I just pulled this off of

229
00:11:22.784 --> 00:11:25.034
the CodePen website 1b2b34.

230
00:11:27.668 --> 00:11:30.196
That causes this to be unreadable.

231
00:11:30.196 --> 00:11:32.403
Let's actually just go up to CodePen

232
00:11:32.403 --> 00:11:35.074
and just set the color to be white on that in general.

233
00:11:35.074 --> 00:11:36.330
And that'll make everything white

234
00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:37.726
that's generally what we need happening

235
00:11:37.726 --> 00:11:40.100
rather than having to reset it on each one.

236
00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:42.517
Good now let's go to the editor,

237
00:11:42.517 --> 00:11:45.872
and that's each individual one we have three editors.

238
00:11:45.872 --> 00:11:49.374
And of the editors we have editor header,

239
00:11:49.374 --> 00:11:52.169
and then we have this editor code which should be the rest.

240
00:11:52.169 --> 00:11:53.994
And you see that it's currently not

241
00:11:53.994 --> 00:11:55.115
being as high as it should be,

242
00:11:55.115 --> 00:11:57.313
it should take up this entire space.

243
00:11:57.313 --> 00:12:01.480
So we need to now make the editor itself display grid,

244
00:12:02.544 --> 00:12:06.693
and we want the header to take up as much room as it needs.

245
00:12:06.693 --> 00:12:09.883
And then we want the code to take up the rest of the room.

246
00:12:09.883 --> 00:12:14.050
So say grid template rows one or auto, that's the header

247
00:12:15.923 --> 00:12:18.973
and then 1fr to take up the rest.

248
00:12:18.973 --> 00:12:20.704
And that didn't seem like it did much

249
00:12:20.704 --> 00:12:23.915
but now if you hover over top of the header in the code,

250
00:12:23.915 --> 00:12:27.203
you'll see that they are now taking up the entire space.

251
00:12:27.203 --> 00:12:30.803
And then the editor code in itself

252
00:12:30.803 --> 00:12:35.003
also needs to be display grid because the child of the code,

253
00:12:35.003 --> 00:12:37.173
which is there is the gutter,

254
00:12:37.173 --> 00:12:38.655
and then there is the input

255
00:12:38.655 --> 00:12:42.055
so those two things now need to go below each other.

256
00:12:42.055 --> 00:12:44.055
So editor code,

257
00:12:44.055 --> 00:12:46.714
that one will be displayed grid,

258
00:12:46.714 --> 00:12:50.631
and the gutter is going to be very, very small.

259
00:12:52.074 --> 00:12:55.314
And then this text area is gonna take up the rest

260
00:12:55.314 --> 00:12:56.492
of the area.

261
00:12:56.492 --> 00:12:59.575
So let's say grid, template, columns,

262
00:13:00.412 --> 00:13:01.245
auto 1fr.

263
00:13:02.703 --> 00:13:03.772
(whistling)

264
00:13:03.772 --> 00:13:04.605
Starting to look good.

265
00:13:04.605 --> 00:13:07.602
Oh the reason why this one didn't expand is because

266
00:13:07.602 --> 00:13:08.562
I've been,

267
00:13:08.562 --> 00:13:10.842
I was playing with it and then I set it

268
00:13:10.842 --> 00:13:12.442
inline width to it,

269
00:13:12.442 --> 00:13:13.310
which is not what we want.

270
00:13:13.310 --> 00:13:14.191
So I'm just gonna delete that,

271
00:13:14.191 --> 00:13:16.082
and you'll see that it goes back

272
00:13:16.082 --> 00:13:17.532
and snaps too.

273
00:13:17.532 --> 00:13:19.931
The gutter is going to be as wide as it needs to be

274
00:13:19.931 --> 00:13:21.892
and we're gonna take these spans

275
00:13:21.892 --> 00:13:23.141
or the class of the line number

276
00:13:23.141 --> 00:13:24.503
and we're gonna make them blocks,

277
00:13:24.503 --> 00:13:26.271
so that they go onto their own lines.

278
00:13:26.271 --> 00:13:28.972
So we'll grab the class on each of those numbers,

279
00:13:28.972 --> 00:13:31.389
editor number, display block.

280
00:13:32.551 --> 00:13:34.263
And that should make them stack.

281
00:13:34.263 --> 00:13:35.430
And I believe,

282
00:13:36.991 --> 00:13:40.423
put a little bit of padding on either side of that,

283
00:13:40.423 --> 00:13:41.256
good.

284
00:13:42.821 --> 00:13:44.852
Now let's go to our editor input,

285
00:13:44.852 --> 00:13:47.831
this little text area that we have here.

286
00:13:47.831 --> 00:13:50.322
As a class of editor input.

287
00:13:50.322 --> 00:13:52.722
We're going to make it resize none,

288
00:13:52.722 --> 00:13:54.812
take off that little thing.

289
00:13:54.812 --> 00:13:56.229
Background, none.

290
00:13:59.572 --> 00:14:00.572
Border zero.

291
00:14:02.491 --> 00:14:03.491
Color, gray.

292
00:14:04.962 --> 00:14:06.795
Make the font size 16.

293
00:14:08.671 --> 00:14:10.823
And line height 25.

294
00:14:10.823 --> 00:14:11.959
I was just playing around with that.

295
00:14:11.959 --> 00:14:12.792
Whoa.

296
00:14:12.792 --> 00:14:13.625
PX.

297
00:14:15.572 --> 00:14:16.941
That's not any good,

298
00:14:16.941 --> 00:14:18.644
you see it's not lining up here.

299
00:14:18.644 --> 00:14:20.492
All right you're probably at the,

300
00:14:20.492 --> 00:14:23.244
there's probably some scientific way to line it up,

301
00:14:23.244 --> 00:14:25.611
but I'm just gonna cheat it.

302
00:14:25.611 --> 00:14:27.004
Ah good enough.

303
00:14:27.004 --> 00:14:28.012
19.

304
00:14:28.012 --> 00:14:29.914
Yeah 19 pixels looks good to me.

305
00:14:29.914 --> 00:14:31.363
So it's lining up.

306
00:14:31.363 --> 00:14:32.954
What else do we have to do here?

307
00:14:32.954 --> 00:14:34.834
I think, oh we got this footer here.

308
00:14:34.834 --> 00:14:35.667
I think we're done

309
00:14:35.667 --> 00:14:38.812
all of the alignment stuff using grid

310
00:14:38.812 --> 00:14:42.444
and I think that the last little piece is to go down

311
00:14:42.444 --> 00:14:46.277
to this last little one which is the settings.

312
00:14:47.284 --> 00:14:49.794
Here and say settings.

313
00:14:49.794 --> 00:14:50.627
Padding.

314
00:14:50.627 --> 00:14:52.783
Put a little maybe 10PX on that.

315
00:14:52.783 --> 00:14:53.616
That's too much.

316
00:14:53.616 --> 00:14:55.172
5PX?

317
00:14:55.172 --> 00:14:56.005
Good, good.

318
00:14:56.005 --> 00:15:00.204
Background is going to be that gray color.

319
00:15:00.204 --> 00:15:01.124
Good,

320
00:15:01.124 --> 00:15:03.372
no that's the same color as the,

321
00:15:03.372 --> 00:15:04.812
make it just black.

322
00:15:04.812 --> 00:15:06.044
Good.

323
00:15:06.044 --> 00:15:09.294
And border dash top when PX solid gray.

324
00:15:12.194 --> 00:15:13.050
Looking good.

325
00:15:13.050 --> 00:15:13.892
Looking good.

326
00:15:13.892 --> 00:15:16.052
There's a couple little things if you look at the answer,

327
00:15:16.052 --> 00:15:18.132
I've got a couple more borders here and there

328
00:15:18.132 --> 00:15:19.052
and whatnot,

329
00:15:19.052 --> 00:15:22.052
but I'll let you spend some time finessing

330
00:15:22.052 --> 00:15:23.514
the borders and whatnot.

331
00:15:23.514 --> 00:15:27.623
The idea here is that we built all of this stuff with grid

332
00:15:27.623 --> 00:15:30.844
and we're actually making it look pretty good.

333
00:15:30.844 --> 00:15:34.181
It's pretty easy to snap together an application

334
00:15:34.181 --> 00:15:38.022
that seems relatively complex just with using grid

335
00:15:38.022 --> 00:15:40.524
nested inside of each other a couple times over.

336
00:15:40.524 --> 00:15:41.942
So hopefully you enjoyed that one.

337
00:15:41.942 --> 00:15:43.084
I'll see you in the next one.

338
00:15:43.084 --> 00:15:45.604
(upbeat music)
