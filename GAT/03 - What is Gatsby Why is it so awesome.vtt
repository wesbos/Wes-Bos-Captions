00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.667
(melodic music)

2
00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:05.670
<v ->Alright, what is Gatsby?</v>

3
00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:06.960
Like? What's the big deal?

4
00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.690
Why does everybody love it?

5
00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:10.780
What I'm going to do in this video sort of break down,

6
00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:12.810
I think what are the more important parts

7
00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:15.030
to me the developer

8
00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.430
as to why this is an awesome framework

9
00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:18.500
for building a website.

10
00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.250
So I like to think of Gatsby

11
00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.260
as a framework for building modern websites.

12
00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.040
And the reason we call it a framework over a library

13
00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:28.770
is because it comes with everything.

14
00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:30.400
It comes with a way to manage your data,

15
00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.100
It comes with a routing strategy,

16
00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.820
It comes with a build process, all of that stuff.

17
00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.380
Whereas unlike React, React is just a library

18
00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:41.900
that's used for rendering out data

19
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.011
to HTML or to

20
00:00:44.011 --> 00:00:46.090
the DOM very quickly.

21
00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:49.830
So React does use ,sorry, Gatsby does use React

22
00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:52.670
under the hood and then adds on a whole bunch

23
00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.480
of other stuff use for building a modern website.

24
00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.470
So why does everybody love it?

25
00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:59.970
Well, it makes it really, really easy.

26
00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:02.430
Almost effortless, I would say,

27
00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.690
to create fast and modern websites.

28
00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:06.190
So modern websites,

29
00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:09.380
I've just got to two websites up right here.

30
00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:11.750
This is going to be what we're building in

31
00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:13.020
this website here.

32
00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.440
This is Slick's Slices is going

33
00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.320
to be available at Gatsby.pizza.

34
00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:18.860
If you want to visit it,

35
00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:20.180
just see what we're building as well

36
00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:21.940
as my own personal website.

37
00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:25.150
I have been running on Gatsby as well.

38
00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:26.550
So like, what's the big deal?

39
00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:28.470
Well, this is my Homepage and if I click

40
00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:29.550
over to my Blog page,

41
00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:31.350
you see how fast that was for click back

42
00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.370
to my Homepage, boom, blog page, go over to this.

43
00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:37.280
You see how fast I'm navigating this.

44
00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.500
I'm not on particularly fast internet.

45
00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.490
And I didn't do a whole bunch

46
00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:46.150
of extra work in order to make that, that fast.

47
00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:49.140
So previously with other CMSs,

48
00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.980
if you wanted to use a lot of the

49
00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:53.173
new JavaScript things like PushDate,

50
00:01:53.173 --> 00:01:55.510
like like if I go to

51
00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:58.220
my Pizza Menu,

52
00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:01.520
and I click on Onion and I Go back to all

53
00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.630
you'll see how the URL is updating up here.

54
00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.500
However, I'm not actually reloading the page.

55
00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.580
It's simply just pushing from one page to another.

56
00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.980
If I go to my order and we add some things to our order,

57
00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.240
and then we go back to the Homepage,

58
00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:19.830
and we go back to order, the order is still there.

59
00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.040
Because we're actually not going from page to page,

60
00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.940
we're just loading in different pieces of the website

61
00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.180
and then updating the URL.

62
00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.200
So it's it's almost effortless in order

63
00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.540
to make a really fast website like that.

64
00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:33.910
So why is it fast?

65
00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:37.490
Well, at the core of Gatsby, it's what is referred to

66
00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:40.490
as a static site generator or pre generation,

67
00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:44.110
meaning that there is a build step in your website.

68
00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:47.120
So if you think of something like a WordPress,

69
00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.150
WordPress is on demand, meaning if somebody goes to

70
00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:51.630
a blog post on your website,

71
00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:56.510
what happens is that WordPress accepts the URL.

72
00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.057
It parses the slug into ,

73
00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:01.410
this is a tag page.

74
00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:02.760
This is a single Blog Post.

75
00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.350
This is a paginated page four and then it takes

76
00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:08.520
that URL and translates it into what needs

77
00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:11.080
to be looked up in the Database.

78
00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:14.010
It translates it into what Template needs to be rendered,

79
00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:15.790
it takes your data from your database,

80
00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:19.310
your template, puts them together, generates the HTML,

81
00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:21.470
and then spits it out The other end.

82
00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:22.790
There's a whole bunch of steps that sort

83
00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:24.220
of go on in between that.

84
00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.730
So Gatsby still does that type of thing.

85
00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:29.640
But it's done at build time.

86
00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.310
Meaning that when I'm ready to push

87
00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:33.770
this WesBos.com up,

88
00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:36.760
it will take five ,10 minutes or depending

89
00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:39.810
on if you have a special build setup,

90
00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.320
you can actually get it done in just a couple of seconds.

91
00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:44.660
It will regenerate the HTML for us.

92
00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:46.240
So if we go to this page here,

93
00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:49.170
and I were to view the source on it,

94
00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:51.870
you'll see that all of this HTML

95
00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:54.020
is generated here and that was not done

96
00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:57.470
when I visited the website ,that was done a week ago,

97
00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:59.410
the last time I built my website.

98
00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:02.540
And by doing having all of that HTML,

99
00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:05.410
already generated it allows the website

100
00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:08.040
to load much, much faster.

101
00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:11.740
Other things that it does is it's smart about your CSS,

102
00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:15.010
meaning that it will load the critical CSS.

103
00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:18.570
So if I go to this blog post here,

104
00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:20.020
and I look at the view source,

105
00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:22.570
you're going to see a whole bunch of CSS

106
00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:24.670
that has been loaded in here.

107
00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:27.410
And Gatsby is able to figure out what

108
00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:29.590
is the CSS that is needed.

109
00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:31.630
So when I load the page,

110
00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:35.290
it loads the CSS as fast as possible,

111
00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:37.890
or it loads the CSS before the content,

112
00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:41.910
meaning you don't get that jerk , jerky motion

113
00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:44.940
where you it's called the flash of unstyled content

114
00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:47.780
that that sort of goes on the website.

115
00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:50.220
Other things that it does is it does rehydration.

116
00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:52.600
So like what makes Gatsby different

117
00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:55.400
than just any other static site generator out there?

118
00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:59.780
Well, if we go to this page right here,

119
00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:03.490
this isn't is a React application here.

120
00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:06.000
So even if you were to,

121
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.860
if you page source,

122
00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:10.733
and let's see exactly ,here we go.

123
00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:16.690
It says, For about exactly 65 or whatever milliseconds,

124
00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:18.030
I've been a developer.

125
00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:19.923
And if we go to the page here,

126
00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:23.450
that's not the number of milliseconds that's showing up.

127
00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:25.580
That's the number of milliseconds it was

128
00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:27.050
when I built the website.

129
00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:28.930
However Gatsby will do a thing is

130
00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:31.870
where it will load this HTML under the page.

131
00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:33.630
And then it will pick it up from there

132
00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:37.100
and turn it into a fully featured React application.

133
00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:39.170
And in this case, I'm doing something silly

134
00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:40.460
and I'm just updating the number

135
00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:42.500
of milliseconds I've been a developer,

136
00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:44.520
but that just goes to show that

137
00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:47.980
you can have static HTML and then pick it up.

138
00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:51.050
It's called rehydration in the browser

139
00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:53.380
and have a fully featured React application.

140
00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:57.180
Same thing with the the pizza website right here.

141
00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:59.910
This is just static HTML renders out your

142
00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:02.920
info your name, your email, renders out the email.

143
00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:04.870
And then when it loads,

144
00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:07.940
the browser will then turn it or rehydrate it

145
00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:09.190
into a React application.

146
00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:11.610
So we can do things like add the pizzas

147
00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:15.223
and remove them and submit our actual order.

148
00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:17.073
What else does it do,

149
00:06:17.073 --> 00:06:20.910
it does image,

150
00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:24.280
see how these images are blurry,

151
00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:27.830
and then as I scroll in they load themselves.

152
00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:30.010
That is what is referred to as Lazy Loading.

153
00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:32.610
So you don't need to download the image

154
00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:34.590
until you're just about to see it.

155
00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:36.240
And Gatsby will do that for you.

156
00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:38.100
It'll also compress all of your images,

157
00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:40.010
it will convert them into modern formats

158
00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:42.343
like WebP if the browser supports it.

159
00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:46.200
And all of this like hard stuff

160
00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:49.472
with image handling used to be hard.

161
00:06:49.472 --> 00:06:50.305
(laughing)

162
00:06:50.305 --> 00:06:54.220
So it's now extremely easy when you use a framework

163
00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:56.430
like Gatsby, which is really cool.

164
00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:58.450
It does routing, so again like I said,

165
00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:00.920
If I click through to these,

166
00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:03.973
you see how like the first time I visited this website,

167
00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:07.180
the people were blurry and then they fade in.

168
00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:11.910
And then if I click through to it, it'll take a second

169
00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:14.300
and then load the large image.

170
00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:16.230
But if I go back to SliceMasters Now,

171
00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:17.660
those are already been loaded

172
00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:20.470
so that routing and loading is baked right into it,

173
00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:24.410
as well as huge plugin ecosystem just as a WordPress

174
00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:27.780
is awesome because it has a whole plugin ecosystem.

175
00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:30.940
Gatsby is awesome because you can get plugins

176
00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:33.240
for doing things like offline access

177
00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:36.470
or Code highlighting ,YouTube Embeds, you name it

178
00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:39.080
there's thousands of plugins out there for it.

179
00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:41.260
So that is why people really like Gatsby.

180
00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:44.290
The one thing that gets me is not currently

181
00:07:44.290 --> 00:07:48.950
is it is not a CMS, meaning that there is no back end

182
00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:53.360
that you log into Gatsby and update your content.

183
00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:55.360
For that you'd still need a CMS

184
00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:57.850
whether that is WordPress, or in our case

185
00:07:57.850 --> 00:07:59.510
we're going to use a CMS called sanity

186
00:07:59.510 --> 00:08:02.930
and we'll talk about That much more coming up.

187
00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:04.650
And then finally, there are a couple of

188
00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:08.820
shortcomings in terms of because of its static nature.

189
00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:12.810
You do need to code things in a particular way,

190
00:08:12.810 --> 00:08:15.500
specifically when it comes to dynamic pages,

191
00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:19.100
and we'll for sure be covering all of that in this course.

192
00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:22.450
So that is Gatsby, that's why we really like it.

193
00:08:22.450 --> 00:08:26.040
I just ran the App that we're building through this.

194
00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:27.340
This is called Lighthouse.

195
00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:29.260
And Lighthouse is sort of like,

196
00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:31.850
it'll give you a score on how fast

197
00:08:31.850 --> 00:08:36.130
and best practices and accessible your website is.

198
00:08:36.130 --> 00:08:39.620
And I literally did nothing to get the score.

199
00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:42.090
Meaning that until I was about to record this video,

200
00:08:42.090 --> 00:08:44.870
I didn't even look it up, I didn't tweak anything

201
00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:48.500
like that and we got almost hundreds out of the box.

202
00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:50.070
And that's why it gets to be so good

203
00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:53.240
because by default, it makes you code in such a way

204
00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:54.870
and it builds it in such a way

205
00:08:54.870 --> 00:08:58.890
that you're making a really fast performance accessible,

206
00:08:58.890 --> 00:09:01.890
SEO friendly website which is pretty cool.

207
00:09:01.890 --> 00:09:03.290
That's it, Let's get coding.
