00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.583
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:04.217 --> 00:00:06.560
<v ->Hi folks we gonna start learning about Gatsby querying.</v>

3
00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:10.200
There's two different types of queries that live in Gatsby.

4
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.640
There are page queries and there are static queries.

5
00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:16.340
The difference between a page query and a static query

6
00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:20.130
is that a page query can accept variables

7
00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.610
and can only be done on an actual page in your pages folder.

8
00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:27.700
And a static query can be done anywhere you want,

9
00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:29.680
however they are they cannot be dynamic,

10
00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:30.937
meaning they cannot take variables

11
00:00:30.937 --> 00:00:33.180
and so allow me to explain here.

12
00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.870
If we go to the finished version that we have here,

13
00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:38.470
we are going, if we go to the pizzas page,

14
00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:40.900
we get a list of all of the pizzas that we have,

15
00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.670
but we also want the ability to filter

16
00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.490
based on a specific topping.

17
00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:49.070
And I don't wanna like code this page twice

18
00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:50.930
I don't wanna code the pieces page.

19
00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:53.080
And then I don't wanna code a toppings page

20
00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:54.150
just a little bit different.

21
00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:57.480
So what I wanna do here is on the pizzas page,

22
00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.870
I'm gonna query all of the pizzas that meet

23
00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.050
that have this topping, or if there is no topping specified,

24
00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:08.833
I'm just gonna query all of the, the pizzas that we have.

25
00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:13.010
Now, we'll go a little bit more into that in the future,

26
00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:14.710
but it's really important to note

27
00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:17.400
that if you wanna have variables in your query,

28
00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.800
meaning that you wanna pipe in mushrooms,

29
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.950
it has to happen at a page level.

30
00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.860
That's a bit of a limitation of Gatsby,

31
00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:26.970
just I guess, because of the way that it works,

32
00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.640
how it all needs to be generated upfront.

33
00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.410
So let's get into page queries.

34
00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:37.620
And the way that you specify a page query is you just export

35
00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:41.787
a query from the page and Gatsby is smart enough to say,

36
00:01:41.787 --> 00:01:45.320
"Oh!, that's a query I better go and get that data for you

37
00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:46.960
when we run the build"

38
00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.800
and then it will pass it to our page component.

39
00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.630
So we go here and we'll just say, export const,

40
00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:58.170
a query is equal to graphql, and then we'll use back text.

41
00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.990
So a couple of things need to happen right here.

42
00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:01.873
So this variable right here,

43
00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.120
I always thought that that was like special.

44
00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:08.760
You will also see people using page query

45
00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:11.670
and it doesn't matter what you call it.

46
00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.440
It just matters that if you are exporting something

47
00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.190
that is a graphql query,

48
00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.960
it will then turn that into data for you.

49
00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.943
This graphql here, we may be can auto import it.

50
00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:25.370
There we go.

51
00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:28.800
It's imported as graphql from Gatsby.

52
00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.100
And then we also, I can get rid of this layout,

53
00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.370
cause we're no longer using that.

54
00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:34.510
Then inside of here,

55
00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:36.020
that's where we're going to go ahead

56
00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:37.420
and write all of our queries.

57
00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.891
So if we open up the local host, underscore, underscore,

58
00:02:41.891 --> 00:02:44.180
underscore underscore graphql

59
00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:47.980
you remember that we wrote this query here.

60
00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.150
It says allSanityPizza.

61
00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.730
And then for each node, we want the name,

62
00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:55.620
the ID the price of slug and all of that good data.

63
00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.560
So when here we can go ahead and start writing our queries.

64
00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:59.603
So we type query.

65
00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:04.040
Now we are gonna come back and modify this to take

66
00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.830
variables, which is the filter for the pizza.

67
00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:08.360
But in our case,

68
00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:11.803
we are not going to be doing that right now.

69
00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:17.520
You can also name this query called like pizza query.

70
00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:20.530
You may see, and I might do this myself.

71
00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:22.330
People not do it

72
00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:26.270
just because it's not necessary to add it,

73
00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:27.730
but you can pop a name on it.

74
00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:29.250
It's kind of like an anonymous function

75
00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:30.763
versus the name function.

76
00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:36.100
Then inside of here, we will query all of our sanity pizza

77
00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:37.833
So say allSanityPizza.

78
00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:42.140
Now I, you saw me put parentheses on the end there.

79
00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:43.190
We don't need them just yet.

80
00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:45.330
We will add them when we need to filter

81
00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:47.710
for the different topics that we have.

82
00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:51.810
And then for each sanity pizza, we need the node.

83
00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:56.070
And this is probably easier just to go into your graphql

84
00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:58.360
explorer here, or graphical

85
00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:00.760
and write this query inside of here,

86
00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:03.883
because you get all of the, the IntelliSense here.

87
00:04:03.883 --> 00:04:05.670
It will try to auto complete it.

88
00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:08.760
And also if you're having trouble with a query,

89
00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:12.450
like, let's say, you accidentally forgot the S on nodes.

90
00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:13.960
Like I just did.

91
00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:15.650
And then I want the name of the pizza.

92
00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:18.610
Let's try run this query so you would select all of this,

93
00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:21.277
not the surrounding backticks

94
00:04:21.277 --> 00:04:24.240
and just paste it in here and you run it.

95
00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.370
And it gives you an error,

96
00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:28.070
cannot read node on sanity pizza connection.

97
00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:29.490
Did you mean nodes?

98
00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:30.660
Yes, I did.

99
00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:33.230
So I'd go and add an S here.

100
00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:35.270
I had an S here.

101
00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:38.680
Run it, and there we go see it's now showing up.

102
00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:39.770
What else do we want for here?

103
00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:41.910
We want the ID of the pizza.

104
00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:46.133
We want the slug of the pizza, which has a current property.

105
00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:50.040
We also want the toppings on each of those pizza

106
00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:52.490
and for each of the toppings,

107
00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:53.880
you want the topping ID

108
00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:57.010
and the name of that topping.

109
00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:00.840
And then finally, and this is where we get into images.

110
00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:03.110
We'll cross that in a second, but we'll query it right now.

111
00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:04.150
We say image

112
00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:06.920
cause that's our field

113
00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:09.670
and normally you think like, Oh I just get the image

114
00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:13.390
and it gives me a URL,

115
00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:15.450
but in our case, we're going to be using something

116
00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:16.380
called Gatsby image,

117
00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:18.130
which we'll go into in just a second.

118
00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:20.600
But for now we just have to write this ourselves.

119
00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:23.670
So image, asset, nested inside of that,

120
00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:28.560
we want fluid parenthesis max width 400.

121
00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:31.670
Again, this will makes sense once we get into Gatsby image,

122
00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:34.290
and then we use something in graphql called the fragment.

123
00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:36.230
So inside of this fluid,

124
00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:37.120
there's gonna be something,

125
00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:38.790
there's gonna be like a don't type this

126
00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:41.370
there's gonna be like a base 64.

127
00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:43.423
There's also gonna be like an asseturl.

128
00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:49.190
There's gonna be a width there's gonna be a height.

129
00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:52.880
And so often you're gonna be querying all of these fields

130
00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:54.380
for the same thing.

131
00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:57.340
And in graphql, when you query the same thing

132
00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:59.310
over and over and over again,

133
00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:01.240
it's easier to not just have to type it,

134
00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:03.560
but to stick it inside of a fragment.

135
00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:08.560
And a fragment is just a collection of fields that we want.

136
00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:10.230
That's kind of a weird thing about graphql.

137
00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:13.000
As you can't just like ask for like give me everything

138
00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:13.960
that you have.

139
00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:17.320
You have to specifically ask for every field that you want.

140
00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:19.960
And if that's feeling a little bit cumbersome to you,

141
00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:21.540
you need to stick it in a fragment.

142
00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:22.380
And in our case,

143
00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:23.930
the fragments come with Gatsby

144
00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:25.580
So it's ...GatsbySanityImageFluid

145
00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:35.010
So all this is called upper camel case.

146
00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:37.370
So capital G on and then capital letters

147
00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:38.830
on all of the letters.

148
00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:40.990
Now, one kind of weird thing about that

149
00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:44.580
is now, if you were to take this query

150
00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:46.083
and paste it into here,

151
00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:50.590
we get an unknown fragment Gatsby sanity fluid.

152
00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:54.480
And that's because I'm not sure why

153
00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:55.570
this doesn't work that way,

154
00:06:55.570 --> 00:06:57.930
I guess, just because Gatsby adds this fragment

155
00:06:57.930 --> 00:06:59.300
as part of the build,

156
00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:01.250
but it's not available in graphical,

157
00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:03.883
it seems like maybe they could fix that.

158
00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:08.320
But if that was the case, then you'd have to, I don't know,

159
00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:10.380
Here we go you can just select some,

160
00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:14.410
you can just change it to SFC and that will see it gives you

161
00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:16.667
an actual URL of the actual pizza,

162
00:07:16.667 --> 00:07:19.140
but we need a lot more fields than just the SFC.

163
00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:21.430
So we'll be using that.

164
00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:24.260
Okay, so give that a Save now and now go back

165
00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:28.363
to your page and open up react dev tools.

166
00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:33.280
And we want to find our pizzas page component.

167
00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:36.050
This is why it's important to name your page components

168
00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:38.310
because we can go to the react dev tools

169
00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:40.860
and then just search for the pizzas page component

170
00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:46.863
which is here we pizzas page right here.

171
00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:52.170
Ooh! Hot export it pizzas page (laughs)

172
00:07:52.170 --> 00:07:53.700
That's funny so hot export

173
00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:55.350
it means that that's hot reloading.

174
00:07:55.350 --> 00:07:57.710
That's the quick reload,

175
00:07:57.710 --> 00:07:59.370
but you should see in here

176
00:07:59.370 --> 00:08:02.730
that we now have in the props of that component,

177
00:08:02.730 --> 00:08:04.950
we have a data prop,

178
00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:07.590
and then it says allSanityPizza.

179
00:08:07.590 --> 00:08:09.270
And then inside of that, we have our nodes.

180
00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:12.000
And then finally we have both of our pizzas

181
00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.920
accessible to us.

182
00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:15.310
One little thing I like to do

183
00:08:15.310 --> 00:08:17.810
is I don't like to type all sanity pizza

184
00:08:17.810 --> 00:08:21.120
or all sanity people or anything like that.

185
00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:24.020
I like to just name them what they are pizzas.

186
00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:24.900
And that's especially true

187
00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:27.520
if you were to ever like switch CMSs,

188
00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:29.310
you might have to update your queries anyways.

189
00:08:29.310 --> 00:08:31.400
But I don't like the name of this.

190
00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:34.890
So you can rename a query in graphql

191
00:08:34.890 --> 00:08:37.610
by doing this pizzas colon.

192
00:08:37.610 --> 00:08:39.400
And what that does is it renames it

193
00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:42.070
from allSanityPizza just to pizzas.

194
00:08:42.070 --> 00:08:45.150
And now look at that I just refreshed,

195
00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:48.730
now, we see pizzas instead of allSanityPizzas.

196
00:08:48.730 --> 00:08:53.320
Okay, so now the question is how do you access that in here?

197
00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:55.250
Well, we can go into here

198
00:08:55.250 --> 00:08:56.850
and we could say props

199
00:08:56.850 --> 00:08:59.420
and we could just simply just console.log the props

200
00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:01.051
that are available to us.

201
00:09:01.051 --> 00:09:02.250
And this is a little bit weird.

202
00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:03.083
You might be asking like,

203
00:09:03.083 --> 00:09:06.460
okay, well like how does this get from here to there?

204
00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:07.715
Like we're not passing it or anything.

205
00:09:07.715 --> 00:09:10.030
And that's a little bit of Gatsby magic

206
00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:14.240
Gatsby will recognize that you have exported a graphql

207
00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:16.550
component from the page,

208
00:09:16.550 --> 00:09:20.020
and then it will run it behind the scenes

209
00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:22.270
and then stick it into props.data.

210
00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:23.520
So let's just console log props.

211
00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:25.170
See what we're working with here.

212
00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:33.010
I like to just refresh the page,

213
00:09:33.010 --> 00:09:34.803
clear out any garbage in there.

214
00:09:35.930 --> 00:09:38.290
And oh! I think I cleared it out too early.

215
00:09:38.290 --> 00:09:40.080
Let's refresh it, there we go.

216
00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:41.500
There's our props.

217
00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:42.590
And inside of that,

218
00:09:42.590 --> 00:09:44.900
you see stuff about where we are

219
00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:47.970
a little navigate function, but most importantly,

220
00:09:47.970 --> 00:09:50.840
we have props.data.pizzas.

221
00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:54.993
So we can say console log props.data.pizzas.

222
00:09:56.630 --> 00:10:00.000
And now when it runs, we just get our pizzas directly.

223
00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.290
So what a lot of people will do is they'll destructure that

224
00:10:03.290 --> 00:10:07.950
one or two levels deep as sort of as deep as you want.

225
00:10:07.950 --> 00:10:10.570
So you could destructure that into data.

226
00:10:10.570 --> 00:10:13.550
And then we don't need to console log props, that data,

227
00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:15.383
it's just data.pizzas.

228
00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:18.020
There we go that's still works,

229
00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:19.900
and you could go even further.

230
00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:23.080
And destructure that into pizzas directly.

231
00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:24.080
I'm not gonna do that

232
00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:28.050
just cause like I'm not a hot shot.

233
00:10:28.050 --> 00:10:30.345
That seems a little unnecessary to me.

234
00:10:30.345 --> 00:10:32.630
And it gets a little hard to read.

235
00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:36.290
So I just like the destructure one level deep.

236
00:10:36.290 --> 00:10:38.370
I'll probably (laughs) contradict myself

237
00:10:38.370 --> 00:10:39.320
later in this course,

238
00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:41.720
but that's all I'm feeling right now.

239
00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:43.520
And let's just console log the data.

240
00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:46.253
Beautiful, okay.

241
00:10:46.253 --> 00:10:49.400
So, that's working so far.

242
00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:51.720
Now, we want to figure out

243
00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:54.550
how to start to display our pizzas on the page.

244
00:10:54.550 --> 00:10:56.210
Well, we can start doing something like this.

245
00:10:56.210 --> 00:10:58.010
Let's go into this paragraph and say,

246
00:10:58.010 --> 00:11:01.100
Hey there are, I can go in here and say

247
00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:05.413
data.pizzas.length pizzas.

248
00:11:08.410 --> 00:11:13.410
There are, Oh! There our pizzas (laughs)

249
00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:18.490
What did we do?

250
00:11:18.490 --> 00:11:21.831
Alright, data.pizzas.

251
00:11:21.831 --> 00:11:23.090
Oh! There we go.

252
00:11:23.090 --> 00:11:24.900
So that's a bit of a problem it's not pizzas.

253
00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:26.830
It's nodes inside of that.

254
00:11:26.830 --> 00:11:30.370
So data.pizzas.nodes.length

255
00:11:33.050 --> 00:11:34.730
and there we go there are two pizzas.

256
00:11:34.730 --> 00:11:36.837
You may also do this up here.

257
00:11:36.837 --> 00:11:40.370
You could just say const pizzas

258
00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:46.420
is equal to data.pizzas.nodes.

259
00:11:47.010 --> 00:11:47.950
And then we can just go ahead

260
00:11:47.950 --> 00:11:50.400
and have this nice clean variable called pizzas.

261
00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:52.600
So again, you could destructure in the object

262
00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:56.110
or do it right before you return your JSX.

263
00:11:56.110 --> 00:11:57.940
Both of them work really well.

264
00:11:57.940 --> 00:11:59.810
There we go, the hey there are two pieces.

265
00:11:59.810 --> 00:12:01.420
So we now see, we have the data.

266
00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:02.900
Now you might be saying like, okay,

267
00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:05.720
Wes, like what about loading state, right?

268
00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:07.801
Like you refresh the page

269
00:12:07.801 --> 00:12:10.350
and just works like in your other courses,

270
00:12:10.350 --> 00:12:11.840
we always had to do this whole song

271
00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:15.530
and dance of if it's loading and then also check,

272
00:12:15.530 --> 00:12:18.447
is there data and in Gatsby you just go ahead and use it.

273
00:12:18.447 --> 00:12:20.700
And that's the beauty of Gatsby

274
00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:23.450
is that there's never a loading state in Gatsby

275
00:12:23.450 --> 00:12:25.720
because it's all prebuilt.

276
00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:28.520
So before this page even renders,

277
00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:30.080
the pizzas will be there very similar

278
00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:31.530
to how server side rendering works.

279
00:12:31.530 --> 00:12:34.670
It just happens at build time rather than render time.

280
00:12:34.670 --> 00:12:36.900
So we don't have to check if there's loading

281
00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:38.990
and throw up spinner or something like that,

282
00:12:38.990 --> 00:12:41.400
because the pizzas will always be there

283
00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:43.020
because this page will not be rendered

284
00:12:43.020 --> 00:12:45.440
until it's there and in build time,

285
00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:46.640
we'll build it,

286
00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:47.690
the pizzas will be there

287
00:12:47.690 --> 00:12:50.500
and then we'll ship it off to the server.

288
00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:51.810
Okay, cool.

289
00:12:51.810 --> 00:12:55.190
Now, we wanna build another component that we'll go ahead

290
00:12:55.190 --> 00:12:57.890
and display all of the pizzas that we have.

291
00:12:57.890 --> 00:13:00.590
We could loop over the pieces right inside of here,

292
00:13:00.590 --> 00:13:05.590
but I always like to keep my pages as thin as possible,

293
00:13:06.550 --> 00:13:07.670
where you have your queries

294
00:13:07.670 --> 00:13:10.170
and then you just kind of block out the pieces

295
00:13:10.170 --> 00:13:11.230
that you want there.

296
00:13:11.230 --> 00:13:13.210
And then we'll use another component

297
00:13:13.210 --> 00:13:15.010
to actually display the pizzas.

298
00:13:15.010 --> 00:13:18.280
So let's go into our components folder here

299
00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:19.490
and make a new file.

300
00:13:19.490 --> 00:13:22.177
And we'll call that capital P PizzaList.js.

301
00:13:29.330 --> 00:13:32.713
I'm going to use import react from react,

302
00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:38.280
export default function, pizzaList.

303
00:13:42.130 --> 00:13:45.893
And then we're just return paragraph list of pizzas.

304
00:13:47.410 --> 00:13:50.390
And we'll go into here and try to use that component.

305
00:13:50.390 --> 00:13:53.390
So now I'm gonna get rid of this paragraph tag

306
00:13:54.650 --> 00:13:59.350
and we will just say PizzaList component,

307
00:13:59.350 --> 00:14:02.450
and then we will try to auto import that sucker.

308
00:14:02.450 --> 00:14:03.283
Boom! Okay.

309
00:14:03.283 --> 00:14:05.580
So if that didn't work for you import pizzaList

310
00:14:05.580 --> 00:14:08.460
from we go up a level into components

311
00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:10.840
and then grab it from the piece of list directory,

312
00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:15.023
give that a Save and pizzaList is not defined.

313
00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:17.750
Just needed a refresh.

314
00:14:17.750 --> 00:14:19.970
Sometimes you gotta we'll call that,

315
00:14:19.970 --> 00:14:20.930
give it a hot supper.

316
00:14:20.930 --> 00:14:22.930
So sometimes you just gotta give it a hot supper

317
00:14:22.930 --> 00:14:24.090
and refresh the whole thing.

318
00:14:24.090 --> 00:14:26.280
So it works.

319
00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:27.460
Alright, so now we have this.

320
00:14:27.460 --> 00:14:29.440
Now we wanna get the pizzas,

321
00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:31.540
which is here into that component.

322
00:14:31.540 --> 00:14:33.830
So we'll pass that down via props.

323
00:14:33.830 --> 00:14:35.250
So we'll go here,

324
00:14:35.250 --> 00:14:39.773
we'll say pizzas is equal to curly bracket pizzas.

325
00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:44.750
Then we can go into this pizzaList

326
00:14:44.750 --> 00:14:49.040
and destructure that prop pizzas, is that what we call it?

327
00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:49.873
Yep.

328
00:14:51.370 --> 00:14:54.120
And then let's just do one more check to say,

329
00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:58.187
there are pizzas.length zas.

330
00:15:01.323 --> 00:15:02.156
There we go,

331
00:15:03.030 --> 00:15:04.463
Looking good, okay.

332
00:15:06.180 --> 00:15:10.240
Now, what we wanna do is to loop over each of those pizzas

333
00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:12.400
and display each one that we have.

334
00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:15.740
So I'm gonna go and remove this

335
00:15:15.740 --> 00:15:18.240
and let's just give ourselves a div for now.

336
00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:21.780
And then we'll do curly brackets and we take our pizzas

337
00:15:21.780 --> 00:15:23.190
and you map over it.

338
00:15:23.190 --> 00:15:25.670
So if you wanna loop over something in react,

339
00:15:25.670 --> 00:15:27.560
you use a map function.

340
00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:30.050
And then from each pizza that you have,

341
00:15:30.050 --> 00:15:32.450
we get singular pizza.

342
00:15:32.450 --> 00:15:36.360
So for each pizza that we have take an individual pizza,

343
00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:38.740
and then from that return,

344
00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:41.653
a paragraph tag that says pizza,

345
00:15:43.430 --> 00:15:44.950
and there we go, so we have two pizzas.

346
00:15:44.950 --> 00:15:47.004
So we get two paragraph tags that show us

347
00:15:47.004 --> 00:15:50.090
that we each have a pizza, okay.

348
00:15:50.090 --> 00:15:51.740
Then we could replace that.

349
00:15:51.740 --> 00:15:53.623
We could say like pizza.name,

350
00:15:56.210 --> 00:15:58.740
there we go veggie delight and master pizza.

351
00:15:58.740 --> 00:16:00.740
But what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna make another

352
00:16:00.740 --> 00:16:04.750
component that is used for displaying a single pizza.

353
00:16:04.750 --> 00:16:08.270
So anytime I have this whole like grid of items

354
00:16:08.270 --> 00:16:09.720
and then singular items,

355
00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:12.070
I'll almost always make a separate component

356
00:16:12.070 --> 00:16:14.530
for the grid and then another component

357
00:16:14.530 --> 00:16:15.890
for the individual one.

358
00:16:15.890 --> 00:16:20.090
So let's go (clicking) let's go above it.

359
00:16:20.090 --> 00:16:24.933
So I'll say function single pizza.

360
00:16:26.730 --> 00:16:28.617
And you'll notice I'm not exporting this one.

361
00:16:28.617 --> 00:16:29.700
And the reason behind that

362
00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:31.990
is because I'm not actually gonna be using this

363
00:16:31.990 --> 00:16:33.400
anywhere else throughout the website.

364
00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:36.210
If I was, I could simply just export it

365
00:16:36.210 --> 00:16:38.120
and that would make it accessible.

366
00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:40.600
And I could use that anywhere else I wanted on the site.

367
00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:43.160
But in my case, we're just gonna be using it right here.

368
00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:45.000
So I'm gonna keep it in the same file.

369
00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:46.900
You might also be asking Wes,

370
00:16:46.900 --> 00:16:49.960
like why didn't you create like one function per component?

371
00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:51.860
Like, why don't you just create another component

372
00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:53.360
for that single pizza,

373
00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:56.250
And into that I say, that's too confusing.

374
00:16:56.250 --> 00:16:58.350
If I'm just gonna use it here,

375
00:16:58.350 --> 00:17:00.030
then I'm gonna put it in the same file.

376
00:17:00.030 --> 00:17:02.235
And then if I find myself saying like,

377
00:17:02.235 --> 00:17:04.560
Oh! Man, like I'm using this all over the website.

378
00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:06.310
I better put it in its own component.

379
00:17:06.310 --> 00:17:10.420
But in this case, I always opt for putting it all

380
00:17:10.420 --> 00:17:14.020
in one file and then chunking it out if I need to,

381
00:17:14.020 --> 00:17:16.560
rather than by default making a million files,

382
00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:19.150
cause that's no way to live your life.

383
00:17:19.150 --> 00:17:21.230
Or maybe it is you do you, yeah?

384
00:17:21.230 --> 00:17:22.630
It's a free world out there.

385
00:17:23.997 --> 00:17:24.830
What do we've got here?

386
00:17:24.830 --> 00:17:25.880
Single pizza, okay.

387
00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:30.880
And that will take in a pizza prop, okay.

388
00:17:31.110 --> 00:17:35.010
And then from here, let's just return.

389
00:17:35.010 --> 00:17:37.680
Let's do this first return a paragraph tag

390
00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:40.670
with the pizza.name inside of it.

391
00:17:40.670 --> 00:17:42.030
And we can go down here

392
00:17:42.890 --> 00:17:45.340
and replace this paragraph tag

393
00:17:45.340 --> 00:17:49.057
with a single pizza component.

394
00:17:51.410 --> 00:17:56.033
And then that needs to be passed the singular pizza.

395
00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:01.910
And that should work, give it a hot supper refresh.

396
00:18:01.910 --> 00:18:03.780
And here we go it's working now.

397
00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:06.010
It will yell at us about a key

398
00:18:06.010 --> 00:18:07.310
let's take a look here.

399
00:18:07.310 --> 00:18:09.270
Warning each child in a list

400
00:18:09.270 --> 00:18:11.393
should have a unique key prop, okay.

401
00:18:11.393 --> 00:18:12.230
Now, that's good.

402
00:18:12.230 --> 00:18:14.450
So anytime you map over something,

403
00:18:14.450 --> 00:18:19.020
you must give the individual item a unique key,

404
00:18:19.020 --> 00:18:22.810
so react can keep track of it and update it quickly.

405
00:18:22.810 --> 00:18:26.880
And that's why we queried the ID of the pizza.

406
00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:30.230
Cause that is a perfect use case for an ID in a key.

407
00:18:30.230 --> 00:18:35.030
So I would say key is equal to pizza.id,

408
00:18:35.030 --> 00:18:37.930
give it a Save, hot supper refresh

409
00:18:37.930 --> 00:18:42.320
and all kinds of other garbage in here.

410
00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:43.710
Hopefully this gets cleaned up soon,

411
00:18:43.710 --> 00:18:47.717
but there's no actual error coming from our things.

412
00:18:47.717 --> 00:18:50.230
And the way you can tell if that's an error,

413
00:18:50.230 --> 00:18:54.160
is if the actual error that you're getting here is coming

414
00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:56.050
from one of your components

415
00:18:56.050 --> 00:19:01.050
versus some junk in inside of Gatsby, okay.

416
00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:03.970
Alright, let's work on the single pizza here.

417
00:19:03.970 --> 00:19:05.850
So instead of returning a paragraph tag,

418
00:19:05.850 --> 00:19:07.360
we'll return a div

419
00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:11.340
inside of that, we'll have a link to that pizza.

420
00:19:11.340 --> 00:19:15.420
So a link to, and this is how we generate

421
00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:18.730
the individual pizza URL.

422
00:19:18.730 --> 00:19:21.650
So we'll link to forward slash pizza

423
00:19:21.650 --> 00:19:24.090
forward slash and we're gonna interpolate.

424
00:19:24.090 --> 00:19:26.350
So that's why we did this is a little bit confusing,

425
00:19:26.350 --> 00:19:30.690
but if you wanna generate a slug,

426
00:19:30.690 --> 00:19:31.890
you around here,

427
00:19:31.890 --> 00:19:33.897
you use curly brackets backticks.

428
00:19:33.897 --> 00:19:35.870
And then from there on out,

429
00:19:35.870 --> 00:19:38.670
it's just a ESX template strings.

430
00:19:38.670 --> 00:19:40.840
So we have to use dollar-sign, curly bracket

431
00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:45.690
to interpolate things like the pizza.slug.current.

432
00:19:45.690 --> 00:19:46.627
You may be saying like, Wes,

433
00:19:46.627 --> 00:19:50.280
"How did you know that that was pizza.slug.current?"

434
00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:52.993
Well, you could go to my components here.

435
00:19:54.110 --> 00:19:56.640
And oh! It's given us grief about the link

436
00:19:56.640 --> 00:19:59.070
we got to auto import that sucker.

437
00:19:59.070 --> 00:20:01.120
There we go, important link from Gatsby

438
00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:09.270
and let's look for a single pizza, here we go.

439
00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:12.720
Let's see in here, we've got two single pizzas

440
00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:15.960
and you see in the props, we have our slug.

441
00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:18.560
And then it gives us the current value of the slug,

442
00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:20.560
which is veggie-delight.

443
00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:23.620
Now we can go inside of this link.

444
00:20:23.620 --> 00:20:26.420
I hope my prettier auto closed it.

445
00:20:26.420 --> 00:20:30.470
I gotta close it like that and put something inside of it.

446
00:20:30.470 --> 00:20:31.380
I'm Inside of that,

447
00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:34.770
let's give ourselves an h2 tag

448
00:20:34.770 --> 00:20:39.770
where we put the pizza.name inside of it.

449
00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:45.260
Here we go, Veggie delight, Master Pizza.

450
00:20:45.260 --> 00:20:48.410
If we click on one of those, it doesn't work.

451
00:20:48.410 --> 00:20:50.760
And that's because we haven't created

452
00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:52.910
this veggie delight page yet.

453
00:20:52.910 --> 00:20:54.280
In order to do this,

454
00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:56.380
we're not gonna be creating a new page

455
00:20:56.380 --> 00:20:58.110
in our pages folder for every single pizza.

456
00:20:58.110 --> 00:21:00.450
Cause that would be millions of pizzas

457
00:21:00.450 --> 00:21:01.670
or millions of pages,

458
00:21:01.670 --> 00:21:04.420
but we will be dynamically creating those pages

459
00:21:04.420 --> 00:21:05.913
in a future video.

460
00:21:07.170 --> 00:21:08.570
Also what we want inside of here,

461
00:21:08.570 --> 00:21:11.233
just for some CSS that's coming up.

462
00:21:12.090 --> 00:21:17.090
I want you to take a span with a class of Mark

463
00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:22.850
and then put the pizza.name inside of that.

464
00:21:22.850 --> 00:21:25.810
That's just gonna be for some styling.

465
00:21:25.810 --> 00:21:28.430
Look that we have you take a look here.

466
00:21:28.430 --> 00:21:30.883
This little highlight here is a class of Mark.

467
00:21:31.780 --> 00:21:33.640
Go back to the pizzas page, there we go.

468
00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:35.800
See, that's showing up there.

469
00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:38.060
Now below this h2 we wanna,

470
00:21:38.060 --> 00:21:40.300
let's render out a list of the toppings that we have.

471
00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:42.430
So we'll give ourselves a paragraph tag

472
00:21:42.430 --> 00:21:47.430
and we'll take the pizza.toppings and we'll map over that.

473
00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:49.860
So you could kick this out to a separate component,

474
00:21:49.860 --> 00:21:52.350
but I don't think it's necessary given how small it is.

475
00:21:52.350 --> 00:21:54.480
So a map over each topping,

476
00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:58.710
and then this is an implicit return arrow function.

477
00:21:58.710 --> 00:22:03.710
We will return the topping.name.

478
00:22:05.780 --> 00:22:07.380
And you might be saying like Wes,

479
00:22:07.380 --> 00:22:09.580
where's the like a paragraph tag

480
00:22:09.580 --> 00:22:10.890
or where's the span around that?

481
00:22:10.890 --> 00:22:12.950
Let me show you what we got here.

482
00:22:12.950 --> 00:22:14.660
So give that a Save.

483
00:22:14.660 --> 00:22:15.880
You'll see, Oh!Look at that,

484
00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:18.140
mushrooms, onions, pepperoni mushrooms, onions bacon.

485
00:22:18.140 --> 00:22:21.140
So what we did there is we simply just took

486
00:22:21.140 --> 00:22:23.830
the list of toppings mapped over it

487
00:22:23.830 --> 00:22:25.690
and returned just the topping name.

488
00:22:25.690 --> 00:22:27.260
So let me show you an example here.

489
00:22:27.260 --> 00:22:30.633
So let's look for a single pizza again, there we go.

490
00:22:33.056 --> 00:22:35.230
And then we open up the pizza

491
00:22:35.230 --> 00:22:39.540
and I believe that we can access this component.

492
00:22:39.540 --> 00:22:42.470
If I click on it and go to our console,

493
00:22:42.470 --> 00:22:44.770
we can type $r.

494
00:22:44.770 --> 00:22:49.230
There we go, that gives us the component

495
00:22:49.230 --> 00:22:51.270
that is currently selected in here.

496
00:22:51.270 --> 00:22:54.590
And then if we look inside of there, do we have props,

497
00:22:54.590 --> 00:22:58.910
good $r.props.pizza.

498
00:22:58.910 --> 00:23:02.600
Okay, and then .toppings that gives us an array

499
00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:05.650
of the toppings, but like, don't care about the ID.

500
00:23:05.650 --> 00:23:08.030
I just want the name of it.

501
00:23:08.030 --> 00:23:12.730
So it will say $r.pizza.toppings.map.

502
00:23:12.730 --> 00:23:14.990
I'll say topping and we're just return

503
00:23:14.990 --> 00:23:17.190
the topping.name and what that does

504
00:23:18.830 --> 00:23:23.110
is returns just an Array of the toppings.

505
00:23:23.110 --> 00:23:25.580
And then we can simply just run .join

506
00:23:25.580 --> 00:23:29.170
on it with anything we want in between

507
00:23:29.170 --> 00:23:31.470
in our case we'll just join those things together

508
00:23:31.470 --> 00:23:33.510
with our divider here.

509
00:23:33.510 --> 00:23:37.890
So in our case, we wanted to use a comma space

510
00:23:37.890 --> 00:23:39.610
here we go nice little list.

511
00:23:39.610 --> 00:23:42.980
So in our case, there's no need to loop over it

512
00:23:42.980 --> 00:23:44.750
and wrap each one in a span.

513
00:23:44.750 --> 00:23:48.630
So we could just do this where we map over it.

514
00:23:48.630 --> 00:23:53.543
And then we use join comma space after.

515
00:23:54.590 --> 00:23:57.500
Here we go, got all of our toppings showing up.

516
00:23:57.500 --> 00:23:59.900
Cool, so I think that's enough for this video

517
00:23:59.900 --> 00:24:03.040
and what we have left here yet is being able

518
00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:05.550
to get the images showing up

519
00:24:05.550 --> 00:24:07.243
on this page of the pizza.
