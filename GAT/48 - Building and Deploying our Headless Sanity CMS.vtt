00:00:00.474 --> 00:00:03.057
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:06.200
<v Instructor>All right, there's still a little bit</v>

3
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:07.467
of CSS that needs to be done here,

4
00:00:07.467 --> 00:00:09.590
and we need to make the thing responsive.

5
00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:11.420
There's like little stuff like this should be centered

6
00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:13.780
and maybe spaced out a little bit more.

7
00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:15.970
We'll get to all that in a video soon,

8
00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:17.770
but I want to get this thing online for you

9
00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:20.700
so you can actually show your mom, something like that.

10
00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:25.950
We need to talk about deploying and building this thing.

11
00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:29.130
Let's start with our backend, which is our sanity.

12
00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.840
You're not going to just be running NPM start

13
00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:33.210
in order to edit this thing.

14
00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.450
You need the whole sanity CMS to be online somewhere.

15
00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:39.510
And that's kind of like the cool thing about sanity

16
00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.460
is that the sanity studio,

17
00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.241
which we've been working with has been our backend,

18
00:00:45.241 --> 00:00:47.950
and you can actually host that directly on sanity.

19
00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:49.560
And that's how most people go and do it.

20
00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:50.860
You can also host it yourself,

21
00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:53.230
but in order to get it up and running

22
00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:55.310
and just use sanity studio,

23
00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:59.980
you simply just type "NPM," no, "sanity deploy."

24
00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:02.950
And that will go ahead and do a whole bunch of stuff.

25
00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:06.180
And it will say, what is your host name?

26
00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.570
Oh, we'll call it Slick's Slices.

27
00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:10.730
And you can't do that.

28
00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:13.190
So don't email me, "Wes, Slick's Slices is taken."

29
00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:14.210
I took it.

30
00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:16.310
You put your own name on the end of there.

31
00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.370
And oh, host name was already taken.

32
00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:25.100
Maybe that was me when I was building this thing.

33
00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.943
We'll put Wes on the end, or Wes Bos on the end.

34
00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:30.740
There we go.

35
00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.973
Building, clearing output folder.

36
00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.820
All right, it didn't work.

37
00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:45.760
Minifying JavaScript bundles. (imitates buzzing)

38
00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:46.799
Didn't work.

39
00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:51.799
No such file or directory as master Gatsby sanity status.

40
00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.220
There's no static folder?

41
00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:55.370
Let's take a look here.

42
00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:00.620
Let's make a directory called static, mkdir static.

43
00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:02.060
And you might already have that.

44
00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.860
Maybe I'll add that to the starter files if that fixes it.

45
00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.203
Let's try it again, sanity deploy.

46
00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.240
Looks like that fixed it.

47
00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.230
So I'll add that to the starter files.

48
00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:17.340
You've probably already have that,

49
00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:18.510
but if you get that error,

50
00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.170
that's cause you need to create a static folder.

51
00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:22.260
Looks like I've got

52
00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.150
Slick's Slices Wes Bos at sanity.studio.

53
00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.710
I can open that sucker on up,

54
00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:30.220
and I'll probably ask me to log in.

55
00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.700
And if I'm not already logged in to sanity.studio.

56
00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.020
Here we are. It looks like I already am.

57
00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:37.470
And look, this is everything that we've built.

58
00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.410
You can see all of our data is now showing up

59
00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:44.050
inside of here, but we don't have to run that locally.

60
00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:47.350
So that is how to get sanity up and running.

61
00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:48.183
Pretty cool.

62
00:02:48.183 --> 00:02:51.080
If you actually just take a look here, open it up,

63
00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.890
go to your sanity, go to your dist folder.

64
00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:56.160
This is actually the sanity studio right here.

65
00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.320
So if you want it to host the sucker yourself,

66
00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:01.100
you can just do that.

67
00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:02.410
I think if I just double click it,

68
00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:03.990
look, you can just run it locally.

69
00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:05.410
I'm not sure if it will run locally,

70
00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:08.820
but you can host this anywhere you want.

71
00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:10.700
Just make sure that you add that domain name

72
00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.470
to your allowed API routes,

73
00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.710
and then you could do that for a client.

74
00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:18.860
But I recommend just putting it on sanity.studio

75
00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:22.080
because they know how to host this stuff.

76
00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:23.170
All right, that's the first one.

77
00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:24.003
In the the next one,

78
00:03:24.003 --> 00:03:26.610
we'll talk about building and deploying our Gatsby website.
