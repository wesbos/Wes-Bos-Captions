00:00:00.141 --> 00:00:02.724
(Upbeat music)

2
00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:05.620
<v Narrator>At this point in the course,</v>

3
00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:06.805
we've set up our Gatsby website.

4
00:00:06.805 --> 00:00:09.600
And we've done some very basic templating and layout

5
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.030
and creating of pages.

6
00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:13.110
On the other hand, we've done our sanity,

7
00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:14.360
we've created our schemers

8
00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:15.940
and we've created a couple content types

9
00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:17.970
and added some data to that.

10
00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.490
But now the question is,

11
00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:22.190
how do I take the data that lives in sanity,

12
00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:24.705
and get it into my Gatsby website.

13
00:00:24.705 --> 00:00:26.614
Before we even get into how to do that,

14
00:00:26.614 --> 00:00:31.614
I want to bring you into the GraphQL playground.

15
00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:32.860
If you take a look at...

16
00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:36.650
when you run NPM start on your Gatsby website,

17
00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:38.060
obviously gives you a local host,

18
00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:40.710
whatever for your Gatsby website.

19
00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.120
That's what we got going here.

20
00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.030
But then it also gives you this URL,

21
00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.450
___GraphQL.

22
00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:49.330
And if we go ahead and visit that,

23
00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:50.210
you'll see actually,

24
00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.120
you probably won't see this beer query.

25
00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.023
That's to come.

26
00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.853
Just you wait, it's gonna be real good.

27
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:01.080
This is the graphical,

28
00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:03.000
graphical is how you say it?

29
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.850
And basically this is just a playground

30
00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:08.723
that allows you to see what are called GraphQL queries.

31
00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.660
And you can run queries in here

32
00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:13.627
and see what data it returns you.

33
00:01:13.627 --> 00:01:15.940
We're going to be leaning on this a lot

34
00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:19.160
in order to write the different queries that are needed.

35
00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.160
The whole idea behind Gatsby

36
00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:24.880
is that at build time,

37
00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:25.950
when we build our website,

38
00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.710
before we deploy it to the internet,

39
00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.620
Gatsby will go and gather all of the the data

40
00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:34.690
that it needs in order to run.

41
00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:37.200
In our case, it's going to go over to sanity

42
00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.570
and grab all the pizzas,

43
00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:39.620
all the people,

44
00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:40.810
all the toppings,

45
00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:43.530
and all the relationships between all of those

46
00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:44.363
and all...

47
00:01:44.363 --> 00:01:45.196
everything that we've done.

48
00:01:45.196 --> 00:01:47.150
It's going to go ahead and grab all that data,

49
00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:49.970
and it's going to stick it in...

50
00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:51.650
I'm not going to call it a database

51
00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:53.834
because as soon as it's done,

52
00:01:53.834 --> 00:01:54.667
it's disappeared,

53
00:01:54.667 --> 00:01:58.030
but it sticks it into its memory

54
00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:03.030
and it allows us to query that data via GraphQL queries.

55
00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.240
Now if we look at this GraphQL endpoint right now,

56
00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.530
you'll see there is already a couple of different queries

57
00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:14.000
that come standard with Gatsby.

58
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.820
And there's some pretty simple things like all files,

59
00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:19.023
all site,

60
00:02:19.023 --> 00:02:20.860
you can get some siteMetadata,

61
00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:22.350
directories, things like that.

62
00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:27.030
But most of this is not very useful to us as web developers.

63
00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.270
It's more for lower level plugin authors

64
00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:31.533
and things like that.

65
00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:35.640
What we want to do is to figure out

66
00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.380
how do we surface the data from our sanity

67
00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.500
into this GraphQL explorer here,

68
00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.960
so that we'll see it listed in the queries

69
00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:47.540
and we'll be able to go ahead and pull that.

70
00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:49.520
The way that we do that is via plugins

71
00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:54.520
and plugins are defined in our Gatsby-config.js

72
00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:59.770
and the Gatsby config file is a spot

73
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.180
where we can...

74
00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.600
mostly you're going to be specifying plugins

75
00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.660
that are used on your website.

76
00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.090
However you can also specify Metadata

77
00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.930
about your website things like URLs,

78
00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:14.490
and titles and whatnot.

79
00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:17.310
And then there's some lesser used ones.

80
00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:18.930
Things like pathPrefix.

81
00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.000
Like if you're deploying this Gatsby website

82
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.540
to wesbos.com/blog,

83
00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:25.950
and not just like a domain,

84
00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:27.910
you could add that there.

85
00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:30.280
And then some polyfilling and whatnot stuff

86
00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.220
that isn't as commonly used.

87
00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.380
Let's go ahead and create that file.

88
00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.840
And we'll actually do some site Metadata first,

89
00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.790
just to show you how we can add it

90
00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:43.610
and how it gets sourced to the GraphQL Explorer,

91
00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:45.800
and then we'll look at adding sanity plugins,

92
00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:47.290
so we can pull all of our data in there.

93
00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:50.907
We already have Gatsby browser, Gatsby SSR,

94
00:03:50.907 --> 00:03:52.730
and we're in to make a new one

95
00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:54.320
in the very root of our folder

96
00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:59.090
and that's going to be called gatsby-config.js.

97
00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:01.687
Then in here, we'll say export default {

98
00:04:03.403 --> 00:04:04.730
In a lot of the documentation,

99
00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:05.650
you might see this,

100
00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:07.410
this is module.exports.

101
00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:11.380
This is what's referred to as commonJS syntax.

102
00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:13.143
And at the time of recording,

103
00:04:13.991 --> 00:04:18.530
NOJA's is currently adding the ability to do this

104
00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:20.230
which is ES modules

105
00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:22.133
And this is commonJS module.

106
00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:26.870
I don't like having to use commonJS modules

107
00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:29.020
because everything else is ES modules

108
00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:30.450
I like to just keep it all the same.

109
00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:34.960
So I've added a little bit of stuff in the package JSON,

110
00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:36.680
in order to start it.

111
00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:38.140
Let me see here,

112
00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:40.430
this little trick right here

113
00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:41.700
that might even be gone

114
00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:43.260
by the time you're taking this course

115
00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.130
because as soon as Gatsby implements this,

116
00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:47.040
I'll just take that out,

117
00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:49.680
and it will simply just be Gatsby build.

118
00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:51.670
So don't worry about that all that much.

119
00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:54.007
Then in here, we can say siteMetadata.

120
00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:58.940
This one has cost me a couple hours,

121
00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:01.130
make sure it's capital M on Metadata

122
00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:03.510
but no capital D on that

123
00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:05.960
because Metadata is one word.

124
00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:07.810
I had a capital D on one of my websites

125
00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:10.683
and it worked for the longest time until it didn't.

126
00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:13.180
And that's an object.

127
00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:14.260
And then inside of there,

128
00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.253
we can do things like the title of Gatsby.

129
00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:21.370
You notice that Gatsby docs use backticks here.

130
00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:24.330
And there's nothing special about that.

131
00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:26.180
You can use single, double, triple

132
00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:29.520
because this is JavaScript file, not a JSON file.

133
00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:30.353
You can use,

134
00:05:30.353 --> 00:05:33.068
I'll use backticks here just to show you again,

135
00:05:33.068 --> 00:05:35.460
I'll call it Slick's Slices,

136
00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:38.380
can do things like site URL,

137
00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:43.350
it's going to be https://gatsby.pizza

138
00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:47.630
And then description,

139
00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:52.373
we'll say the best pizza place in Hamilton.

140
00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:55.010
Give that a save.

141
00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:59.370
Now I believe that you need to...

142
00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:02.320
you might need to restart your build.

143
00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:06.590
Currently, they're working on not having to restart

144
00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:07.740
your build every time

145
00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:11.820
that you change your Gatsby browser config, or SSR.

146
00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:15.900
So that might be changed by the time you're doing this.

147
00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:18.060
But let's see here.

148
00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:21.910
We'll go back to our graphical

149
00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:23.580
and just refresh that page,

150
00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:27.440
then we should be able to query the data via this.

151
00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:29.170
However, because we just created this,

152
00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:31.790
you might need to restart your process

153
00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:32.700
at the time of recording,

154
00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:34.900
you do need to restart your process.

155
00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:36.690
Just go to your terminal,

156
00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:38.230
hit Ctrl+C to kill it,

157
00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:39.350
I always like to clear it out.

158
00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:41.540
I hit command-K or Command-R,

159
00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:45.500
and then I rerun NPM start from there.

160
00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:47.530
And what that will do is when it's starting,

161
00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:50.910
it first checks for gatsby-config.js,

162
00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:52.530
and then any settings that are in here

163
00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:55.123
gets applied to that build.

164
00:06:56.606 --> 00:06:57.439
There we go,

165
00:06:57.439 --> 00:06:59.330
now if we refresh the page here,

166
00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:00.870
get rid of whatever is in here.

167
00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:03.110
These are all the queries that we have in here.

168
00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:05.650
And the way that you write a query in GraphQL,

169
00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:08.330
is you type query and {.

170
00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:11.480
And we're going to be writing quite a few of these

171
00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:14.370
in our different pages and components.

172
00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:17.393
And then inside of there, we see that we have site.

173
00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:19.473
We can grab...

174
00:07:19.473 --> 00:07:20.644
actually look,

175
00:07:20.644 --> 00:07:22.170
if you just open and close,

176
00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:24.730
the thing you'll add it to your query.

177
00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:26.220
So it'll build the query for you,

178
00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:27.280
instead of you having to type it.

179
00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:31.160
It will also give you like IntelliSense.

180
00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:33.540
So as you start typing site,

181
00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:34.840
open that up,

182
00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:36.430
I believe it's Ctrl+Space

183
00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:38.422
will give you a possible...

184
00:07:38.422 --> 00:07:40.500
this is what people are referring to

185
00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:42.570
when they talk about typed things

186
00:07:42.570 --> 00:07:46.730
and things like TypeScript or GraphQL is also typed.

187
00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:48.910
They know ahead of time what the possible values are,

188
00:07:48.910 --> 00:07:51.890
so you get this really nice autocomplete.

189
00:07:51.890 --> 00:07:55.540
Inside a site, we can grab siteMetadata,

190
00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:57.223
and then inside of that,

191
00:07:58.420 --> 00:08:00.730
we are able to access the site,

192
00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:02.830
the title, the site URL and the description.

193
00:08:02.830 --> 00:08:04.010
You can take a look right here,

194
00:08:04.010 --> 00:08:04.843
look,

195
00:08:04.843 --> 00:08:06.620
description, site URL and title.

196
00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:09.430
Then we go ahead and run that query.

197
00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:13.290
And you'll see that it returns that data to us.

198
00:08:13.290 --> 00:08:15.490
Now we are going to do the same thing

199
00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:17.230
with our sanity studio.

200
00:08:17.230 --> 00:08:21.100
However we're not going to be just manually typing in here.

201
00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:22.780
We're going to be installing a plugin

202
00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:25.420
that will source that data from sanity

203
00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:29.300
and put it into our GraphQL explorer

204
00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:30.702
that we have right here.

205
00:08:30.702 --> 00:08:32.460
That's what we'll do in the next video
