00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.140 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now we need to build the inventory
management system, which is in our third

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:14.640 line:100% position:50% align:middle
column right here. Whenever we have this
specific halibut and the price or however

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:19.220 line:100% position:50% align:middle
much it costs, we need to be able to
update our state immediately as well as

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:26.150 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Firebase. And Rebase is going to relay
that to Firebase. For every single thing

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:29.680 line:100% position:50% align:middle
in our state, every single fish in our
state, we need to render out one of these

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:35.320 line:100% position:50% align:middle
blocks here, to edit it. Now we already
have that block for adding a new fish,

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:40.440 line:100% position:50% align:middle
where we can add something and say it's
cool and we can have a fish pic in it.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.960 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And when I add that, it will just push it
into our state for us,

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:49.550 line:100% position:50% align:middle
but we can't edit it or delete that actual
item from our inventory at all.

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:54.620 line:100% position:50% align:middle
All we need to do is go to our inventory
component here. And right above our load

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:59.790 line:100% position:50% align:middle
sample fishes and actually above our add
fish form, we need to loop over every

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:03.060 line:100% position:50% align:middle
single fish that we have. We can do the
same thing we've been doing,

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:08.060 line:100% position:50% align:middle
object.keys, this.props.fishes,
because we've already passed down

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.240 line:100% position:50% align:middle
our fishes to our inventory state. At
least I think we have. Let's double check

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.940 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that. Look for our inventory. Oh, we
haven't actually. Here's our inventory,

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:22.430 line:100% position:50% align:middle
so we need to pass down our fishes.
this.state.fishes.

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:29.840 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Good. Go to our inventory here.
this.props.fishes. And we will map over

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:36.547 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that. And the map I am going to pass that
off to another function. We're going to

00:01:36.547 --> 00:01:43.740 line:100% position:50% align:middle
create a render function called render
inventory, I'll say this.renderinventory.

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:49.830 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Then we go up here. We're going to make a
render inventory method,

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:57.940 line:100% position:50% align:middle
which will take in the key. And from that
we will return...let's just return a

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:01.620 line:100% position:50% align:middle
paragraph tag with the actual key. Let's
just make sure this is all actually

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:08.140 line:100% position:50% align:middle
working. Awesome! So now I've got all of
these different fishes popping up and this

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:14.080 line:100% position:50% align:middle
render inventory is then being put into
it. So what HTML do we actually need for

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.560 line:100% position:50% align:middle
this render inventory? We need a div with
a class of fish edit.

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:24.340 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So .fishedit. That needs a key of key,
otherwise React is going yell at us for it

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:29.910 line:100% position:50% align:middle
not being unique. Then inside of that
we've got a whole bunch of inputs that we

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.790 line:100% position:50% align:middle
need. Now we need the following five
things: name, price, status,

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.910 line:100% position:50% align:middle
description, and image. I'm going to do
the same kung fu that I did before.

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:44.240 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We have an input with type of text. This
one needs a name attribute and I'll show

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:49.970 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you why in just a second. Probably put a
placeholder on it just in case we delete

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:56.883 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it entirely. I'll say fish,
paste it in. Uppercase. Okay.

00:02:56.883 --> 00:03:00.606 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Cool! So that's all of our
inputs. However. name, price,

00:03:00.606 --> 00:03:08.560 line:100% position:50% align:middle
status. Status should be a select. So
we'll say select. And that select is going

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.300 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to have two options. You can just look at
your add fish form because this is exact

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:20.950 line:100% position:50% align:middle
same sort of mark up that we had, so we
want fresh and unavailable.

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:30.560 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Description is not an input. It is a text
area. There's a couple more things.

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:34.590 line:100% position:50% align:middle
First of all, we're going to need to put
the value of the fish into it, as well as

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:40.030 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we are going to need to data bind it,
which means that whenever I make an edit

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:46.030 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to any one of these, it's going to update
our state directly. That last part that we

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:52.520 line:100% position:50% align:middle
need is we actually need the information
about the fish. We will go up right before

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:58.376 line:100% position:50% align:middle
our return, and we'll say const fish
equals this.props.fishes[key].

00:03:58.376 --> 00:04:01.700 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And that should give
us the actual fish. And we can go to each

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:12.920 line:100% position:50% align:middle
of these. Satus. Description. Image. And
say value equals fish dot - not fish dot.

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:18.390 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We actually need the value there. Here we
go. Name, price, status,

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:24.630 line:100% position:50% align:middle
description and image. Let's take a look
at where we're at. React is going to yell

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:28.510 line:100% position:50% align:middle
at us because we used value and not
default value, and I'll tell you why in

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:32.500 line:100% position:50% align:middle
just a sec. Open up our dev tools here.
Cannot read properties undefined.

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:38.540 line:100% position:50% align:middle
This is an error. I'm glad that we always
trip up on this because this is a big

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:45.230 line:100% position:50% align:middle
thing in React. I use props of this. Why
can't I use this? Because this function,

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:50.950 line:100% position:50% align:middle
render inventory, is not render and it's
not bound to the actual inventory

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:54.080 line:100% position:50% align:middle
component. So how do we do that? Well we
give ourselves a constructor.

00:04:54.080 --> 00:05:02.310 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And we call super. Then inside of that we
will say this.renderinventory equals

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:07.150 line:100% position:50% align:middle
this.renderinventory.bindthis.
When that reloads we now have a couple of

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:10.370 line:100% position:50% align:middle
problems going on here. First of all,
we see all of our fishes.

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:14.860 line:100% position:50% align:middle
This is great. We see all these inventory
things, but I can't edit them.

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:18.750 line:100% position:50% align:middle
What's going on here? And second of all,
I've got this warning in the console here.

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:23.090 line:100% position:50% align:middle
You provided a value of prop without an on
change handler. This will render a read

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:28.240 line:100% position:50% align:middle
only field. If the field is mutable, use
default value. Essentially,

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:35.990 line:100% position:50% align:middle
React doesn't want you just sticking state
fish into an input unless you have a plan

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:41.730 line:100% position:50% align:middle
for actually updating it. If that needs to
just be set once and it's not going to be

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:46.090 line:100% position:50% align:middle
bound to state then that's fine. That's
what we did in our store picker.

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:52.510 line:100% position:50% align:middle
You'll remember that when we did our store
picker ,we used default value instead of

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:56.920 line:100% position:50% align:middle
value. That's because this was not tied to
our state at all. It was simply just a one

00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:03.380 line:100% position:50% align:middle
time thing. React is saying if you put
state in an input box, you must also

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:08.280 line:100% position:50% align:middle
provide us with some sort of instruction
as to how to update that state.

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:14.280 line:100% position:50% align:middle
That's really important because React
doesn't want you just having state in your

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:17.830 line:100% position:50% align:middle
input box in your HTML as well as in state
and they get out of sync.

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:23.200 line:100% position:50% align:middle
It wants one core area where our state is
coming from, and that is our application

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:27.790 line:100% position:50% align:middle
state. To update this box here what we
really need to do is we need to update our

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:32.530 line:100% position:50% align:middle
state, which React will then in turn
update that. It wants to keep them in

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:38.260 line:100% position:50% align:middle
sync. We need to listen for a change on
each of these inputs and when any time any

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:43.140 line:100% position:50% align:middle
of these inputs are changed, we need to
then update our corresponding state.

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:46.720 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So let's do it with a name one first,
then we'll go through and do the rest.

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:52.120 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We'll specify an onchange event listener.
When that happens we are going to run a

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:55.450 line:100% position:50% align:middle
function which gives us the event. Giving
us the event is really important here and

00:06:55.450 --> 00:06:59.791 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I'll show you why in a second. Say
this.handlechange. and we'll pass it the

00:06:59.791 --> 00:07:04.710 line:100% position:50% align:middle
event as well as we'll pass it the key for
that specific fish. Now where did handle

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:09.109 line:100% position:50% align:middle
change come from? I just made that up.
We need to specify our own handle change

00:07:09.109 --> 00:07:11.684 line:100% position:50% align:middle
method here
and we need to grab

00:07:11.684 --> 00:07:16.315 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the actual fish. So I'll say
const fish equals this.props.fishes,

00:07:16.315 --> 00:07:20.920 line:100% position:50% align:middle
so we're back at key. Now, before
we forget, if I use this inside of a

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:25.130 line:100% position:50% align:middle
method that we make up, we need to bind it
to the actual component itself.

00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:31.070 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we'll say handle change. Just to make
sure that this is all working,

00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:35.940 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we are going to console log the actual
fish, and when I change this name input on

00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:39.850 line:100% position:50% align:middle
any of them, it should console log the
corresponding fish. Let's see.

00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:44.230 line:100% position:50% align:middle
No. Key is not defined because our handle
change needs to take in the event and the

00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:51.610 line:100% position:50% align:middle
key. Now when I change it, there we go. We
see our fish. Changed to Pacific Halibut.

00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:54.650 line:100% position:50% align:middle
You notice it's still not changing, and
that's because we have not yet been

00:07:54.650 --> 00:08:00.120 line:100% position:50% align:middle
updating state. These inputs cannot be
edited unless we update state as well.

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:08.310 line:100% position:50% align:middle
However, we are seeing information about
that fish. So we need to first take a copy

00:08:08.310 --> 00:08:16.780 line:100% position:50% align:middle
of that fish and update it with the new
data. We'll say const updated fish equals.

00:08:16.780 --> 00:08:20.220 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now we're going to take a copy of fish.
How do you copy an object?

00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:25.130 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Well you could use object.assign and
you take an empty object and then you put

00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:31.750 line:100% position:50% align:middle
in your fish object. That will take an
actual copy of it. But we can use the fish

00:08:31.750 --> 00:08:37.500 line:100% position:50% align:middle
spread. So ...fish. Then we need
to just overlay our new attributes,

00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:41.190 line:100% position:50% align:middle
or our new properties, on top of it. So
first of all, what changed?

00:08:41.190 --> 00:08:45.940 line:100% position:50% align:middle
How do we know what changed? My console
log... I'll comment that out and console

00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:52.390 line:100% position:50% align:middle
log the event e.target. Let's see what
we got here. I'm going to change fish to

00:08:52.390 --> 00:08:59.300 line:100% position:50% align:middle
fish x. And look. There's our actual
input. So e.target is going to give us

00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:04.693 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the actual element itself and that will
allow us to console log e.target.name.

00:09:04.693 --> 00:09:08.699 line:100% position:50% align:middle
That's why we had to put a name
attribute on it. e.target.value.

00:09:09.030 --> 00:09:16.430 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Let's see here. New fish. I put an x on
the end. Aha! Name? That's the actual

00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:21.750 line:100% position:50% align:middle
property that we're updating. And new fish
x. That's the new value that we've been

00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:27.200 line:100% position:50% align:middle
having there. What we can do is take this
updated fish and overlay the new

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:33.570 line:100% position:50% align:middle
properties on it. So what property has
been updated? Well we can't say like if

00:09:33.570 --> 00:09:39.690 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it's name then type name, if it's image
then type image. We can use what's called

00:09:39.690 --> 00:09:43.630 line:100% position:50% align:middle
a computed property. We can say the
property that we're changing is called

00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:50.260 line:100% position:50% align:middle
e.target.name. Remember that's going
to be name or price or status or

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:55.910 line:100% position:50% align:middle
description or image. The actual value
of that is going to be e.target.value.

00:09:55.910 --> 00:10:01.510 line:100% position:50% align:middle
That's going to help us just change
the one thing that actually changed there.

00:10:01.510 --> 00:10:09.664 line:100% position:50% align:middle
If we console log the updated fish, we
should now see...open that up, the actual

00:10:09.664 --> 00:10:16.457 line:100% position:50% align:middle
name of this value is new fish x, right?
If I console log change

00:10:16.457 --> 00:10:20.346 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Pacific Halibut,
you should then see

00:10:21.227 --> 00:10:25.970 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the name is Pacific Halibut x. Why is this
an array? Actually we don't need the

00:10:25.970 --> 00:10:29.030 line:100% position:50% align:middle
square brackets here because it's not an
array, it's just an actual value.

00:10:29.030 --> 00:10:32.880 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Take those square brackets off. Let me
change Pacific Halibut once more.

00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:38.650 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Put an x on the end. We see that the name
is Pacific Halibut with an x on it.

00:10:38.650 --> 00:10:44.130 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Good, but that's still not updating our
actual inventory, so we need to then take

00:10:44.130 --> 00:10:49.570 line:100% position:50% align:middle
this updated fish and pass it to our app
component which is then,

00:10:49.570 --> 00:10:55.680 line:100% position:50% align:middle
in turn, going to update it. We need to
make one more method on our app component.

00:10:55.680 --> 00:11:01.416 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Right below add fish I'm going to make one
called update fish. That will take in the

00:11:01.416 --> 00:11:05.580 line:100% position:50% align:middle
key of the fish that we want to update,
as well as the new updated fish.

00:11:05.958 --> 00:11:09.510 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Inside of that we'll say const
fishes equals. We'll take a copy of the

00:11:09.510 --> 00:11:17.963 line:100% position:50% align:middle
existing this.state.fishes. Then we'll
update it. So fishes key equals fish. Or

00:11:17.963 --> 00:11:28.121 line:100% position:50% align:middle
maybe we'll call that updated fish. Then
we call set state this.setstatefishes.

00:11:28.981 --> 00:11:32.030 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Good. Now we've got this
updated fish method. We need to make it

00:11:32.030 --> 00:11:36.850 line:100% position:50% align:middle
available to our inventory component here.
Again, you're probably noticing a trend.

00:11:36.850 --> 00:11:41.230 line:100% position:50% align:middle
If I need to make this method available to
something like our inventory component

00:11:41.230 --> 00:11:49.210 line:100% position:50% align:middle
here, like we passed add fish and load
samples and fishes, we can also pass down

00:11:49.210 --> 00:11:55.280 line:100% position:50% align:middle
our update fish, this.updatefish.
Good. We'll go up here.

00:11:55.280 --> 00:12:02.530 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Make sure that our add fish and our update
fish are bound. Then inventory.

00:12:02.530 --> 00:12:09.820 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We'll go back to our handle change method
and say this.props.updatefish.

00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:16.140 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We'll pass it the key as well as our
updated fish object. Now when I update my

00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:22.220 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Pacific Halibut and put cool in front of
it, look! It's updating our state

00:12:22.220 --> 00:12:27.110 line:100% position:50% align:middle
immediately, which means that... Again,
let's go through the flow.

00:12:27.110 --> 00:12:32.490 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We have an onchange handler which will
trigger when someone types into it and it

00:12:32.490 --> 00:12:37.290 line:100% position:50% align:middle
triggers a change. That in turn is going
to run this handle change function,

00:12:37.290 --> 00:12:41.349 line:100% position:50% align:middle
which is going to take a copy of that one
single fish, not all of them, that one

00:12:41.349 --> 00:12:45.640 line:100% position:50% align:middle
single fish. Here's where we take
the copy of it. Then we just overwrite

00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:49.740 line:100% position:50% align:middle
whatever had changed. So this is a dynamic
way to get the name,

00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:54.290 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the price, the status from that fish, and
then we overwrite the actual value that

00:12:54.290 --> 00:12:59.380 line:100% position:50% align:middle
got changed there, so e.target.value.
We then pass that up to our update

00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:04.230 line:100% position:50% align:middle
fish function which lives on our app.js.
Let's take a look here.

00:13:04.230 --> 00:13:11.120 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Update fish. Update fish. That's a little
hot tip. Sublime text hit command R and

00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:14.330 line:100% position:50% align:middle
just type update fish and you can go right
to the actual function.

00:13:14.330 --> 00:13:19.220 line:100% position:50% align:middle
That takes in the key as well as the
updated fish object. We take a copy of all

00:13:19.220 --> 00:13:24.070 line:100% position:50% align:middle
of the fishes, which we always do when we
update our state. We overwrite that one

00:13:24.070 --> 00:13:28.510 line:100% position:50% align:middle
updated fish with our new updated fish
object. Finally we set state,

00:13:28.510 --> 00:13:35.180 line:100% position:50% align:middle
which in turn is going to update our type
box. That's like four steps to update a

00:13:35.180 --> 00:13:39.350 line:100% position:50% align:middle
box. That may seem like, "Wow! That was
like one line in JQuery and this seems

00:13:39.350 --> 00:13:43.570 line:100% position:50% align:middle
like a lot of work," but once your apps
get more complicated, you're really going

00:13:43.570 --> 00:13:48.710 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to love just having your state in one
place and not having to worry about having

00:13:48.710 --> 00:13:52.450 line:100% position:50% align:middle
a bunch of balls in the air. Let's go and
update the rest of them. So we just take

00:13:52.450 --> 00:14:00.730 line:100% position:50% align:middle
this onchange handler, and you can just
pop it on all of the rest of your inputs.

00:14:00.730 --> 00:14:08.260 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Input onselect, on textarea, and on our
description here. I'm going to paste that

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:13.680 line:100% position:50% align:middle
in. Then it should finally stop yelling at
us for not having an onchange handler

00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:18.550 line:100% position:50% align:middle
when we use value. Good, we don't see it
anymore. Then any time I change something

00:14:18.550 --> 00:14:22.480 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that's related to how much this costs, if
I change it from fresh to sold out,

00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:27.870 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it should automatically update. If I
change the description, "This is cool."

00:14:27.870 --> 00:14:32.240 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Good. I just want to double check that
it's also working in our Firebase console

00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:39.830 line:100% position:50% align:middle
here. We are on the store called Drab Drab
Tomato. Open that up.

00:14:39.830 --> 00:14:44.950 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Going to go into fishes. Going to go into
fish one. Cool Pacific Halibut.

00:14:44.950 --> 00:14:51.900 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Bring this sucker over here. When I change
Cool Pacific Halibut to Lovely,

00:14:51.900 --> 00:14:57.870 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it's updating everywhere. Ha! Isn't this
amazing? One state, just sort of like

00:14:57.870 --> 00:15:01.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
propagates wherever else
you wish to have it.
