One of the, probably, easiest way to
deploy your website is using something

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.300 line:100% position:50% align:middle
called "now." If you've never heard of it,
it's actually pretty new.

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:19.250 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now is a way to deploy any type of
application that you have. It started

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:23.430 line:100% position:50% align:middle
primarily with deploying no JS
applications, but now, you can deploy any

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.780 line:100% position:50% align:middle
type of application you want. And it comes
with free open-source hosting,

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:32.130 line:100% position:50% align:middle
which means that if you just want to
deploy your application really quickly,

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.470 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you can do it for free to now, and it's
going to give you a domain and a bunch of

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:40.110 line:100% position:50% align:middle
space to actually do it, and then you can
always upgrade your account to a paid one.

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.300 line:100% position:50% align:middle
But if you just want to try it out to host
your application, maybe to show someone,

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.970 line:100% position:50% align:middle
now is a great use case for this. Now, we
don't want to have to make our own server

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:51.640 line:100% position:50% align:middle
for this, so they also have this thing
called "now-serve," which will allow us

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:56.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
just to serve up the static html file,
which is exactly what we want.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.050 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Let's go over to our iTerm. We need to
install a couple of things first.

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:04.240 line:100% position:50% align:middle
You want to type "npm install -g," make
sure you spell install,

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:09.650 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"install -g," and you want to install
"now" and "now-serve". And then it's going

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:15.650 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to go ahead and globally install those for
you. If you've never logged into now,

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:21.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
simply just type, "now," and it's going to
prompt you to log in or create an account.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.640 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I've already done that, so I don't need to
do that. However, when you are all set-up,

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.350 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we need to first build our application,
which we can do again.

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:37.050 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I've deleted my build directory, so "npm
run build". Once that's created,

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:41.410 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I'm going to move into my build directory.
Again, double-check that you're actually

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:45.440 line:100% position:50% align:middle
in your build directory, not inside of the
catch-of-the-day directory.

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:49.840 line:100% position:50% align:middle
If we see the files that we have there,
you'll see that's where our index.html is.

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:55.400 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now, the very basic of how now-serve works
is you simply type "ns" and hit enter,

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.800 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and that's going to actually deploy it to
the cloud. It's not going to work right

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.810 line:100% position:50% align:middle
away and I'm going to show you
why. What it did right here

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:06.780 line:100% position:50% align:middle
is it deployed it to the cloud for me and
it's brought me to this URL,

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.100 line:100% position:50% align:middle
where it's just a temporary URL. Every
time you deploy, you're going to get a new

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:14.170 line:100% position:50% align:middle
URL. You can apply a domain name to it if
you like, but I'm just going

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.138 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to use this one right here.

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:21.330 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now, it seems like it works. And I visit
the store "fierce-angry-feet," and it

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.630 line:100% position:50% align:middle
actually works, and I can sign in and do
all that good stuff. But look at the URL

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:30.100 line:100% position:50% align:middle
here, "store/fierce-angry-feet," where is
this html coming from?

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:34.700 line:100% position:50% align:middle
That html is still coming from
"index.html" and it seems to work.

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:40.280 line:100% position:50% align:middle
However, if I would now refresh this page
or send someone to this URL,

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:45.820 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it says, "not found". And that's because
now-serve is a static html and it's

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:50.240 line:100% position:50% align:middle
actually looking for a folder called store
and a folder called fierce-angry-feet,

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:55.460 line:100% position:50% align:middle
which is not what we want. We want the
server to serve up our index.html

00:02:55.460 --> 00:03:01.050 line:100% position:50% align:middle
regardless of the URL here, and then we'll
take over the routing on the client's

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:03.980 line:100% position:50% align:middle
side. So we need a little bit further and
pass some arguments here.

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:10.400 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We need to type "ns" and then pass a
command to it, "--cmd" and then "list".

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.920 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now, this is a little bit funky. This
content and directory, we don't have a

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:19.540 line:100% position:50% align:middle
directory called "content," but now puts
our html in a directory on their server

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:22.700 line:100% position:50% align:middle
called content, so that's why we have to
say this content. It's a little bit weird.

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.920 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Hopefully, they'll fix that and make it a
little bit easier.

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:30.180 line:100% position:50% align:middle
The key here is "-s," and what that means
is single page, it means regardless of the

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:35.740 line:100% position:50% align:middle
URL here, it's always going to serve up
that index.html that lives in their form.

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:41.840 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So if I type "ns" command, off and
running, initializing, deploying,

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:48.880 line:100% position:50% align:middle
put me on a new URL here, now it works
great, then I visit the store and it seems

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:54.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to be working. No problem here. If I
refresh, it still brings me to that store,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.720 line:100% position:50% align:middle
even though my index.html is being served
up, so that's a little command.

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:02.560 line:100% position:50% align:middle
One little thing that we could do is use
that as an npm script.

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:11.340 line:100% position:50% align:middle
If I go up one level, and I open up my
package.json file, what we can do is

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:16.650 line:100% position:50% align:middle
actually create a script called "deploy,"
which will deploy it to now.

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:20.500 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We can go on to our script. I'm going to
go right at the bottom here,

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:25.320 line:100% position:50% align:middle
put a comma on there, and I'm going to
call on deploy, and I'm going to put that

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:32.920 line:100% position:50% align:middle
command in here. Now we can switch this to
single quotes. And then the other thing

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:37.520 line:100% position:50% align:middle
is, because we're going to be running this
from the catch-of-the-day folder and our

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:41.770 line:100% position:50% align:middle
actual files have been the build folder,
we have to change this "ns",

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:46.810 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"build", and that's going to just deploy
the build folder, and then it's going to

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:55.280 line:100% position:50% align:middle
run this command for us. So if I save now,
if I run "npm run deploy," it runs the

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:59.160 line:100% position:50% align:middle
deploy for us. It figures out this command
so you don't have to remember that

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:02.610 line:100% position:50% align:middle
command. You'll never do that, but you can
remember npm and deploy,

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:06.040 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it's going to deploy it to a new thing.

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:10.270 line:100% position:50% align:middle
By the way, a little tip, if you hold down
command in iTerm, you can click on the

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:14.320 line:100% position:50% align:middle
URL, makes them clickable, and you don't
have to copy-paste. So it works.

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:22.630 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Load some sample fishes, edit it, refresh,
good. You see that my log in worked there,

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:25.750 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and if you try your log in, it might not
work, and that's because you have to go to

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:31.360 line:100% position:50% align:middle
your Firebase console, and you have to go
to Auth, sign in method,

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:35.310 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and go to Authorized domains here, and you
know how we have localhost,

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:41.850 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and catch-of-the-day.firebaseapp. Now you
have to add in "now.sh" by clicking "add

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:45.620 line:100% position:50% align:middle
domain," because that's the actual domain
that it's going to work on.

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:49.490 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So that is deploying with now, very
simple, very straight-forward.

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:54.210 line:100% position:50% align:middle
You might get an error when you're
deploying, or maybe a warning that says,

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:59.130 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"this file exceeds 1MB" and that's because
our...let me take a look at it,

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:07.500 line:100% position:50% align:middle
open build, going to static, js, this map
file, that's the source map,

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:12.400 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it's pretty big. Mine's 3.3 Megs, and it's
not going to deploy that on the free plan

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:14.920 line:100% position:50% align:middle
for you, but that's totally fine, your
javascript will still work.

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:18.060 line:100% position:50% align:middle
It's just debugging with your map won't
work. Don't worry about it.

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:20.992 line:100% position:50% align:middle
If you see that error,
everything will still work just fine.
