00:00:00.146 --> 00:00:02.729
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.939
<v ->Hello everybody, Wes Bos here thanks so much for</v>

3
00:00:08.939 --> 00:00:11.420
checking out react for beginners, hopefully you're

4
00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:14.210
pretty excited to start learning react.

5
00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:16.280
There's a couple things we need to do in order to get

6
00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:19.250
setup with all the tooling and editor highlighting

7
00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:22.010
and whatnot so this is a pretty important video to

8
00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:24.220
make sure that we don't hit any bumps down the road.

9
00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:26.950
So first let's talk about tooling, what tools do we need?

10
00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:29.920
First you need to do is make sure that you have Node JS

11
00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:31.430
installed on your computer.

12
00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:34.870
Well we're not actually using Node as a back end service

13
00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:37.910
or server or anything like that, we are using Node JS

14
00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:40.442
to run all of the tooling that is required for

15
00:00:40.442 --> 00:00:43.170
developing locally on our computer.

16
00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.680
So if you do not have Node JS installed or if you're

17
00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.690
on a older version of Node JS, and the way you can

18
00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.620
test that is you go to your terminal and just type in

19
00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.622
Node space - V, and that will tell you what

20
00:00:54.622 --> 00:00:56.110
version of Node you're on.

21
00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:59.010
And so if you get an error like Node is not a command

22
00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.583
or you see a version that is maybe a couple versions

23
00:01:01.583 --> 00:01:06.334
behind what is the most recent current version on nodejs.org

24
00:01:06.334 --> 00:01:08.165
then go ahead and just download this.

25
00:01:08.165 --> 00:01:10.270
You click next, next, next and it will

26
00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:11.960
install it to your computer.

27
00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.650
Next what we need is the react dev tools for either

28
00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.180
Chrome or Firefox, and all you need to do is just

29
00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.631
search react dev tools+chrome or +firefox and go ahead

30
00:01:23.631 --> 00:01:25.450
and add those to Chrome.

31
00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:27.280
They way you can tell if they are working is that

32
00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.060
you need to go to a website that has react on it.

33
00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.730
So often I get emails from people where we have this

34
00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:36.370
index.js, and we'll just call it the log hey

35
00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:37.890
and make sure that it's working.

36
00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.710
Well it's not going to show up on this at this point

37
00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.970
because we don't have react installed on this app yet,

38
00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:45.030
so it won't show up.

39
00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.056
So what I like to tell people to do is go over to

40
00:01:47.056 --> 00:01:52.056
Instagram.com or Netflix or Facebook or any application

41
00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.670
that is built on react and just open up your dev tools

42
00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.230
and you should see a new tab, it's usually at the end here,

43
00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:02.270
you can drag and drop if you wanna go higher in the

44
00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.760
order here, and you should see the new react tab

45
00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.570
and that will show you your actual application

46
00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:12.410
as react sees it not as the rendered dom output.

47
00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:15.560
And that's gonna be really helpful for us as we

48
00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.540
move along through our application.

49
00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.630
What we also need is a terminal and if you are on

50
00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:26.560
Windows I recommend you go ahead and grab commander CDMDER

51
00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.370
and that will just give you some nicer syntax highlighting.

52
00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.710
I am on a Mac for this series so I use one called Hyper

53
00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:36.940
however there is a terminal built into OS X.

54
00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:41.228
It will be under your utilities folder and

55
00:02:41.228 --> 00:02:44.060
jump, jump, jump, you see it's right there,

56
00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.145
I'm trying to scroll it into view.

57
00:02:46.145 --> 00:02:48.580
You get the point it's that little one right there.

58
00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:52.010
Or just open up your, what is it, your command space

59
00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:54.580
and type on terminal and you'll see a terminal

60
00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:55.540
window pop open.

61
00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:57.737
We're not going to be doing a whole lot with that but

62
00:02:57.737 --> 00:03:01.590
we do need that to start all of our different tooling.

63
00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.560
If you're curious as to what these color schemes are

64
00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.130
or how I got the git in my thing right here

65
00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:12.050
or any of the colors or the font or anything that I use,

66
00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:14.971
what kind of toilet paper I use, you can go to

67
00:03:14.971 --> 00:03:19.971
wesbos.com/uses and this is just detailing all of the

68
00:03:20.002 --> 00:03:22.360
different little things that I use.

69
00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:25.038
From what font I use to the different emoji pickers that

70
00:03:25.038 --> 00:03:27.410
everyone seems to ask about.

71
00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:30.820
If it's not on there feel free to tweet me I'm @wesbos

72
00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:32.535
and that should help you out.

73
00:03:32.535 --> 00:03:34.640
That is it.

74
00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:37.360
For your text editor, you can use any text editor that

75
00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:38.450
you're comfortable with.

76
00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:42.330
I am using Visual Studio code in this one but you can use

77
00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:46.550
Atom or Sublime or WebStorm, whatever editor that

78
00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:47.700
you're most comfortable in.

79
00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.000
The thing that you need to know about this is

80
00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.510
if you're using Sublime text, and I just popped it open here

81
00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:55.790
you need to make sure that you have the java script babel

82
00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:58.590
highlighter or java script babble highlighter and

83
00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:01.480
not the default java script highlighter because there is

84
00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:05.640
some extended syntax highlighting in something called

85
00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:09.240
jsx that we're going to need, and it just won't

86
00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:12.820
look very nice, it just will kind of get in your way

87
00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:13.653
if you don't have it.

88
00:04:13.653 --> 00:04:16.050
So the way you can do that is you can just open this up,

89
00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:20.570
type install and you'll see package control, install package

90
00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:25.060
and then from that you'll be able to find one called,

91
00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:27.390
I think it's just called babel, let me just find it.

92
00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:31.640
List, packages, babel, yeah it looks like this.

93
00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:34.220
Syntax definitions for esx javascript with

94
00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:37.740
react jsx extensions and then once you're in there

95
00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:41.230
you click on this one in the corner, and you click

96
00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:44.010
open all with current extension, triple check

97
00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:48.290
you're in a .js file, open all with current extension as,

98
00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:50.830
find the one that says babel and then click on the one,

99
00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:52.640
I know you can't see this right now but it says

100
00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:56.377
javascript, brackets babel and that will make sure that

101
00:04:56.377 --> 00:04:58.880
your syntax highlighting no matter what file you're

102
00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:01.540
opening is up to snuff.

103
00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:02.600
So what do we got here?

104
00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:05.300
We got the text editor, we did the terminal.

105
00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:07.170
Let's talk about the step solutions.

106
00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:10.030
So log into your course dashboard and you're gonna see that

107
00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:13.740
your course is listed here, and then you're going to see

108
00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:16.580
a link that says starter files.

109
00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:18.590
Click on that and that's going to link you off to my

110
00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:20.810
github where I host all of the starter files

111
00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:23.250
and the step solutions to this course.

112
00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:24.630
So there's gonna be two folders.

113
00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:26.840
There's gonna be one called catch of the day,

114
00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:31.340
and that's going to include, that's our starter file

115
00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:33.580
for working, there's not much in there when we start

116
00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:35.270
because we're going to be building it all together

117
00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:37.150
but that's where we're gonna be working out of

118
00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:38.600
for the entire course.

119
00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:40.950
So that's your sort of home folder.

120
00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:43.100
If you're gonna bookmark a folder on your computer

121
00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:44.360
that's going to be it.

122
00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:46.800
However there is another one called step solutions

123
00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:50.140
and inside of step solutions there's gonna be a folder

124
00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:53.590
that corresponds with the start of every video.

125
00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:57.420
And I'll say that again, these folders here, like 16,

126
00:05:57.420 --> 00:06:00.720
that corresponds with the start of folder 16,

127
00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:02.120
or video 16.

128
00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:05.590
So if you are having trouble in say, video 15,

129
00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:08.590
and you want to make sure that you're exactly where I am

130
00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:12.170
in video 16 and you want to go forward with the

131
00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:14.420
exact same code that I'm working with than you can go

132
00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:18.280
ahead and grab out the changes from video 16.

133
00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:21.620
So you just copy paste those out of whatever corresponding

134
00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:23.718
one, overwrite any files that you have

135
00:06:23.718 --> 00:06:27.280
and then you'll be in catch of the day,

136
00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:30.180
you'll be up and running with what I have.

137
00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:34.630
Now in the catch of the day folder we do need to

138
00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:36.270
install some of our dependencies.

139
00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:39.160
So what I recommend to people is open up the catch of

140
00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:42.330
the day folder in your editor and then also open it up

141
00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:43.650
in your terminal.

142
00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:46.910
Now if you're having trouble finding where that is,

143
00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:49.180
what I recommended to people is that you just type

144
00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:52.390
cd space, and then open up either your windows

145
00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:55.610
explorer or your finder in OS X,

146
00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:58.470
find the folder that you have, and the just go ahead

147
00:06:58.470 --> 00:07:01.280
and just drag and drop that in there and that's gonna

148
00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:04.830
complete the long path of wherever it is in the

149
00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:06.280
bowels of your computer.

150
00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:08.870
And then hit enter and that will bring you to the

151
00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:12.310
actual catch of the day folder that we're trying to look at.

152
00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:15.970
One thing I will say is that make sure you don't have any

153
00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:20.970
weird characters anywhere along the path to your folder.

154
00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:26.400
So sometimes people put dashes or parentheses or emojis

155
00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:29.680
or stars, I don't know all kinds of weird characters,

156
00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:33.030
and that will for sure screw up the file watching

157
00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:35.710
where when we make a change it's gonna automatically

158
00:07:35.710 --> 00:07:37.180
reload the change.

159
00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:39.759
If that's not working it's likely because you have a weird

160
00:07:39.759 --> 00:07:43.760
character in one of your folders along the way.

161
00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:46.110
And that also goes for renaming folders.

162
00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:48.640
If you rename it halfway through that will likely goof

163
00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:52.120
it up so keep things exactly the same as we have here.

164
00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:54.850
Now in your catch of the day folder open up your

165
00:07:54.850 --> 00:07:57.450
package .json, and the package .json, if you've never

166
00:07:57.450 --> 00:08:01.270
seen one what I'm gonna do here is an nmp install

167
00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:03.950
so if you know what that is you can skip this whole section

168
00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:08.050
but for those who don't know, dev dependencies are things

169
00:08:08.050 --> 00:08:12.620
that are needed in order to locally run our application

170
00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:15.080
and two things here are, the first one is called

171
00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:17.980
react scripts and what react scripts is,

172
00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:22.640
is a tool put out but Facebook and it does underneath

173
00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:26.210
the hood, it does all of the compiling and transpiling

174
00:08:26.210 --> 00:08:28.850
of our javascript code in order for it

175
00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:30.090
to run in the browser.

176
00:08:30.090 --> 00:08:34.450
So you may have previously heard of web pack or some

177
00:08:34.450 --> 00:08:37.050
stuff called babel which will convert all of our

178
00:08:37.050 --> 00:08:40.830
jsx to actual react code, there's a whole bunch of stuff

179
00:08:40.830 --> 00:08:43.155
and we're gonna go through what those things are.

180
00:08:43.155 --> 00:08:47.000
But this sort of takes all the complexity of setting

181
00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.357
up your own development environment and sort of,

182
00:08:49.357 --> 00:08:53.090
temporarily lets us sweep that stuff under the rug

183
00:08:53.090 --> 00:08:56.150
and just get into building our react application.

184
00:08:56.150 --> 00:08:57.950
So it does the web pack and the babel

185
00:08:57.950 --> 00:08:59.300
under the hood for us.

186
00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:01.350
Now if we want to have a little bit of access to

187
00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:04.570
our web pack and our babel config, then I'm gonna

188
00:09:04.570 --> 00:09:07.440
show you how to do something called eject, near the

189
00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:09.200
end of this course, which will give us

190
00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:12.260
full control over and we can see the actual web

191
00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:13.900
pack config that happens under the hood.

192
00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:16.280
And that's kind of the best of both worlds because

193
00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:19.300
it doesn't like, give you the burden of setting up

194
00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:23.060
your own web pack, which is extremely complicated

195
00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:25.590
up front, although if you do want access to it you

196
00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:27.810
can sort of say pretty please and get access to it.

197
00:09:27.810 --> 00:09:29.600
So those are our dev dependencies.

198
00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:31.450
And then we have a couple dependencies and these are

199
00:09:31.450 --> 00:09:33.890
things that are actually needed in our application

200
00:09:33.890 --> 00:09:35.250
to make it run.

201
00:09:35.250 --> 00:09:37.110
So we'll talk about these ones.

202
00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:38.474
These two are for styling.

203
00:09:38.474 --> 00:09:41.580
This one is going to be for connecting to our database,

204
00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:43.191
which is called fire base.

205
00:09:43.191 --> 00:09:47.110
Prop types is something that's going to allow us to

206
00:09:47.110 --> 00:09:49.370
specify what data gets passed in and

207
00:09:49.370 --> 00:09:51.170
what the data looks like.

208
00:09:51.170 --> 00:09:53.870
And that used to be part of react itself, if you're watching

209
00:09:53.870 --> 00:09:56.150
this tutorial for the second, this used to be part of

210
00:09:56.150 --> 00:09:57.982
react now it's in it's own package.

211
00:09:57.982 --> 00:10:01.060
We'll talk about what those are in it's own video.

212
00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:04.220
Rebase is going to allow us to actually connect to fire base

213
00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:06.600
and sync our changes in real time.

214
00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:08.990
React and react dom are the entire reason why

215
00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:10.590
you're taking this course.

216
00:10:10.590 --> 00:10:13.344
React router is going to allow us to watch for changes

217
00:10:13.344 --> 00:10:15.370
and have special url's.

218
00:10:15.370 --> 00:10:18.040
And then finally this transition group is going

219
00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:21.460
to allow us to have nice little animations swoop

220
00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:23.815
things in and swoop things off the screen and whatnot.

221
00:10:23.815 --> 00:10:26.240
We'll go through what all of those are throughout

222
00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:28.020
the entire course.

223
00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:29.890
But those are the only dependencies that you want.

224
00:10:29.890 --> 00:10:32.920
I will recommend that you stick with these versions

225
00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:34.900
that you have here.

226
00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:38.070
I will be updating the course as react gets updated and

227
00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:40.740
as there are new fundamental changes.

228
00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:43.200
But often what will happen, especially in the case

229
00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:47.230
of like prop types, react might like move part of their

230
00:10:47.230 --> 00:10:50.167
dependency to a secondary package and in that case

231
00:10:50.167 --> 00:10:53.100
it will start spitting warnings into your console.

232
00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:55.970
So just know that these versions will be updated

233
00:10:55.970 --> 00:10:59.880
as I need to and for your best experience in learning

234
00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:02.480
react, keep these versions as they are in here.

235
00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:04.640
And then they might even be different because I'll be

236
00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:06.680
updating the github as we go through them.

237
00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:07.970
Finally we got some scripts here.

238
00:11:07.970 --> 00:11:10.330
I'll go through what all these different ones are but

239
00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:13.650
we're mostly just worried about the start command

240
00:11:13.650 --> 00:11:15.940
right now and that's going to run the babel and the

241
00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:19.800
web pack through this thing called create react app.

242
00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:24.800
So let's open up our terminal here and I am in the

243
00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:27.880
catch of the day folder and we just need to go ahead

244
00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:31.390
and type npm install and that's going to fetch

245
00:11:31.390 --> 00:11:34.040
all of those dependencies that are from our package

246
00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:37.070
.json and it's going to go and download a copy of

247
00:11:37.070 --> 00:11:39.560
each of those so that we can run everything locally

248
00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:40.960
and run our compile.

249
00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:43.620
So depending on the speed of your network and your

250
00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:45.710
computer this might take a minute or two.

251
00:11:45.710 --> 00:11:47.800
Once it's finished it actually doesn't tell you

252
00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:52.720
that it worked, I guess it says added 1,444 packages

253
00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:55.840
in 28 seconds, but it will dump a whole bunch of stuff

254
00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:57.820
on the screen as long as you don't see any actual

255
00:11:57.820 --> 00:12:00.370
errors you might see notices and warnings, but

256
00:12:00.370 --> 00:12:02.360
as long as you don't see any errors you're in good shape.

257
00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:05.760
If you're ever having trouble with your install, I do this

258
00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:08.360
all the time, if something maybe has gone wrong

259
00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:11.410
during the install or it's not starting up like

260
00:12:11.410 --> 00:12:15.210
you think it should be, just go into your folder and find

261
00:12:15.210 --> 00:12:18.110
the noda modules folder there and delete it.

262
00:12:18.110 --> 00:12:20.300
You can also try deleting the package lock file.

263
00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:22.730
I would not delete that the first time though.

264
00:12:22.730 --> 00:12:25.370
Just go ahead and delete it and then run npm install again

265
00:12:25.370 --> 00:12:28.230
and that's going to reinstall all of your dependencies.

266
00:12:28.230 --> 00:12:30.570
Now what we need to do to test if it worked,

267
00:12:30.570 --> 00:12:31.820
I'll clear this all out, you just type

268
00:12:31.820 --> 00:12:34.390
npm start and that's going to start up the

269
00:12:34.390 --> 00:12:38.580
create react app server for us and it's going to load

270
00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:40.300
up our local host.

271
00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:42.950
Generally it's going to be local host 3000.

272
00:12:42.950 --> 00:12:45.180
If you have something else running on the port 3000

273
00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:47.180
its gonna ask you for another port.

274
00:12:47.180 --> 00:12:49.330
It's also gonna tell you what your local network ip

275
00:12:49.330 --> 00:12:52.320
address is, so if you'd like to maybe test out the

276
00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:54.910
application on your phone or another computer,

277
00:12:54.910 --> 00:12:57.447
you can always open it up on that local ip address,

278
00:12:57.447 --> 00:13:00.350
as long as your connected to the same wifi network.

279
00:13:01.380 --> 00:13:02.770
Let's get it running then.

280
00:13:02.770 --> 00:13:06.760
There's not much in here, just this little fold button,

281
00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:09.680
and we're gonna be building the entire app out ourselves.

282
00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:13.840
But then go into your editor and in the source folder

283
00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:16.420
you're going to see an index .js file and that will

284
00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:17.686
have nothing in there.

285
00:13:17.686 --> 00:13:19.940
And just to test that everything is working fine,

286
00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:22.920
just type alert hey inside of there and give it a save.

287
00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:25.480
And when we save it, it should automatically detect

288
00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:28.070
that we made a change to one of our javascript files

289
00:13:28.070 --> 00:13:29.900
and the browser should reload itself.

290
00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:33.348
Give it a save and bam, we get the hey there going

291
00:13:33.348 --> 00:13:36.560
and click okay, and everything is in good shape.

292
00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:39.340
So if we've done all that properly, you see the hey

293
00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:41.120
popping up, then we're ready to actually

294
00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:42.560
start writing some react code.

295
00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:43.860
See you in the next video.
