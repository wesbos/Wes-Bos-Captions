If you've ever tried to write HTML in
JavaScript, you'll know

00:00:10.494 --> 00:00:12.260 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that it's a pain in the ass, where
you've got a paragraph,

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:15.650 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and you've got a concatenate in your
variable name, and you've gotta,

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:19.660 line:100% position:50% align:middle
like, open the concatenation again. It's
just a pain in the ass.

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:23.140 line:100% position:50% align:middle
ES6 Template Strings has made it a little
bit better, where you can do things like

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:28.020 line:100% position:50% align:middle
this, and you can say hello inside of it.
However, it's just not completely there.

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:33.890 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So, there's this thing called JSX, which
allows us to write HTML right inside of

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:37.730 line:100% position:50% align:middle
our JavaScript. And, while it's not
completely required by React,

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:42.540 line:100% position:50% align:middle
pretty much everybody uses it, because the
alternative to creating elements inside of

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:48.400 line:100% position:50% align:middle
React is you design like this: You say,
React.create element. You pass it the tag

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.220 line:100% position:50% align:middle
name that you'd like. You pass it an
object for all the attributes,

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:57.050 line:100% position:50% align:middle
maybe, like, class name of testing, and
then, finally, you pass it all the

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:00.090 line:100% position:50% align:middle
content, like, I love you. And what that
will do is it will create a paragraph tag

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.750 line:100% position:50% align:middle
with a class of testing, and it will say,
"I love you." Go back to our code here,

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:09.440 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it says, "I love you." It's gone ahead and
created that paragraph element.

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.240 line:100% position:50% align:middle
But, like, who wants to do that?
Especially when you're nesting things,

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.260 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it's really no way to live your life. So,
rather than use that,

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:22.250 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we use JSX. Now, when you return from a
render, you...previously we just did this

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:27.260 line:100% position:50% align:middle
alone, right? However, you're more than
likely going to do multiple lines of

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.930 line:100% position:50% align:middle
actual code. And you'll know, like, if you
wanted to do this paragraph on its own

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.180 line:100% position:50% align:middle
line, the return is going to put a
semicolon there, and it's not going to

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:39.170 line:100% position:50% align:middle
return anything for us. So what you
actually want to do from your return is

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.610 line:100% position:50% align:middle
give yourself a pair of parentheses. And
then, inside of that,

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.500 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we're going to write all of the HTML that
we actually need. So,

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:53.110 line:100% position:50% align:middle
first tag that we actually need is a form
element here, and if you just type form

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:58.860 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and hit your control e tab, if you have
emmet, it will just expand the actual HTML

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.020 line:100% position:50% align:middle
for you. I've got a blog post on that. If
you're interested in how to get it to

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.450 line:100% position:50% align:middle
work, just search Wes Bos React emmets,
something like that, and you'll find it on

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.400 line:100% position:50% align:middle
my blog post. Now, there's a couple of
different things that we need to know

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:13.960 line:100% position:50% align:middle
about this form element. First of all, if
you want to give it a class,

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:18.530 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and we need to, you cannot just say class
equals store dash selector,

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:23.070 line:100% position:50% align:middle
because class is a reserved word in
JavaScript, and React and JSX have

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:27.930 line:100% position:50% align:middle
disallowed it. So you need to say class
name. That's just one little pain that you

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.840 line:100% position:50% align:middle
need to remember. However, what I find
with using emmet, instead of writing class

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.260 line:100% position:50% align:middle
name every time, I just say form dot store
selector, hit control e,

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.990 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and that will automatically scaffold it
out, and it detects that I'm not in HTML,

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:45.930 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I'm actually in JSX right now, and it's
going to use class name instead of class.

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.080 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We don't need this action here, so you can
go ahead and delete that.

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:55.830 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Another thing we need to know about JSX is
that you can only ever return one parent

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.670 line:100% position:50% align:middle
element, and what I mean by that is, I've
got this form tag here,

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:02.840 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and I can put as much HTML as I actually
want inside of it. However,

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:07.190 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I cannot put, like, maybe a paragraph that
says, right here...watch this.

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:12.340 line:100% position:50% align:middle
If I say this, and we go back to our thing
here, we're going to get an error in our

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:20.020 line:100% position:50% align:middle
console that says syntax fail adjacent JSX
elements must be wrapped in an enclosing

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:25.620 line:100% position:50% align:middle
tag. And that means you can't return it to
elements. You must only ever return one

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:29.580 line:100% position:50% align:middle
parent element and put everything inside
of it. So, if you ever run into that,

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:33.110 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you can just pop a quick DIV around both
of those child elements,

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:38.560 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and that will return a single element. Now
inside of this form we need an H2 tag that

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:47.530 line:100% position:50% align:middle
says please enter a store. We need an
input tag here with the type of text.

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:55.410 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And we are going to have retired on it,
and then the placeholder say store name.

00:03:55.410 --> 00:04:00.470 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And one thing here you may notice, like
this. This is like if you were a developer

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:05.960 line:100% position:50% align:middle
in XHTML four point whatever days, and you
know that everyone used to self close

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:10.650 line:100% position:50% align:middle
their tags. And then HTML5 came around and
we said, "Don't self close your tags,

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:15.130 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it's not necessary." But now we're back at
JSX and you have to self close your tags.

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:21.550 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So, any tag, like an image tag, or an HR
tag, or a BR tag, all of these tags that

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:25.970 line:100% position:50% align:middle
don't have a corresponding, like, closing
tag for you, you need to make sure that

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:32.660 line:100% position:50% align:middle
they self close themselves in JSX. And it
will yell at you if you forget to do that.

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:37.540 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Again, learning emmet in your editor is
probably worth it, just because it takes

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:41.580 line:100% position:50% align:middle
care of all these differences from when
you're writing regular HTML here.

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:47.030 line:100% position:50% align:middle
If I want a button with the type of
submit, just because of some CSS that I

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:51.590 line:100% position:50% align:middle
have, and we'll say visit store. Now, we
haven't actually hooked this up to any

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:55.260 line:100% position:50% align:middle
functionality at this point. It's just
simply what it actually looks like,

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.190 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and what we're going to do is we're going
to circle back and hook up all these

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:02.610 line:100% position:50% align:middle
events. So when you hit submit, we take
the details out of this placeholder here.

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:05.420 line:100% position:50% align:middle
If we hop on over to our browser, you're
going to see, it says,

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:08.050 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"Please enter a store. Store name. Visit
store." It's not styled yet.

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:11.010 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We'll go over that in just a second.
However, there's one more thing I need to

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:14.410 line:100% position:50% align:middle
show you, and that's writing comments in
JSX. So you might think,

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:17.760 line:100% position:50% align:middle
okay, I've got a form here, and I want to
give myself a comment,

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:22.970 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I'll just say, look here. If you save
that, we actually see the JavaScript

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:27.260 line:100% position:50% align:middle
comment here. So I think, okay, maybe I'll
use HTML comments. Look here.

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:30.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Right, because maybe it's like that. That
doesn't work as well.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.860 line:100% position:50% align:middle
It yells at you for actually using a
comment. So if you to comment in React

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:37.880 line:100% position:50% align:middle
JSX, it's a little bit weird. It's a lot
weird. It's really annoying,

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:42.280 line:100% position:50% align:middle
but you have to use curly brackets.
Forward slash star, hello,

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:46.300 line:100% position:50% align:middle
star forward slash. And that is a legit
comment inside of JSX.

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:51.640 line:100% position:50% align:middle
You can always comment regular JavaScript
anywhere else. It's only when you enter

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:57.390 line:100% position:50% align:middle
into this JSX here, where you have to use
these special comments in JSX here.

00:05:57.390 --> 00:06:02.350 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So, if you need any sort of comment, you
need to make sure that you put it in

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:05.530 line:100% position:50% align:middle
there. And then one other, like, really
weird thing that has happened to me

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:08.130 line:100% position:50% align:middle
before, and I banged my head against the
wall for a couple hours,

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:14.620 line:100% position:50% align:middle
so maybe just commit this to memory, if
you put your comment right above whatever

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:19.440 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it is that you return, watch what's going
to happen here. Oh, big error here.

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:23.590 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Module build failed, syntax error.
Unexpected token. It's telling you that

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:27.910 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the problem is that class right here, but
the actual problem is that we're actually

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:33.630 line:100% position:50% align:middle
trying to return this and this. And like
we said earlier, you can only ever return

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:37.500 line:100% position:50% align:middle
a single parent, not two. So don't put
your comments at the top level.

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:41.039 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Either put them above or put them inside
of your actual element

00:06:41.039 --> 00:06:43.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that you're returning there.
