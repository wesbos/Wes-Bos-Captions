This video is going to
be all about state.

00:00:09.178 --> 00:00:12.810 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And state, in React, is a pretty core
fundamental concept, so if there's any

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:15.590 line:100% position:50% align:middle
videos that you're going to back and watch
a couple of times over,

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:21.420 line:100% position:50% align:middle
this is definitely going to be one of
them. State is a representation of all of

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.390 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the data in our application. Each
component can have it's own state,

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:30.930 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and we're going to go into that. However,
you need to think about state as just one

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:36.620 line:100% position:50% align:middle
object that holds all of the data related
to a piece of our application or all of

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:41.790 line:100% position:50% align:middle
our application. For example, right now, I
have state here, which has a listing of

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.870 line:100% position:50% align:middle
all of the fishes. And then I also have
state related to my order or how many of

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:51.860 line:100% position:50% align:middle
them I have purchased, and then it will
calculate it all. If you are coming from a

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:56.700 line:100% position:50% align:middle
background of jQuery, you might be used to
managing your state in your HTML,

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:01.430 line:100% position:50% align:middle
meaning that sometimes you'll get
information out of an input and then put

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:07.840 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it back in. Or you may save some data in
data attributes. Or you may save some data

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.210 line:100% position:50% align:middle
in the DOM and pull it out and put it back
in, and back and forth.

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:15.200 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Where the application is currently at is
done in the DOM.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:21.590 line:100% position:50% align:middle
With React it's totally different, in that
you store all of your data in this master

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:26.840 line:100% position:50% align:middle
object called state, and whenever you want
to change anything on the page,

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.440 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you edit your state and you let React
handle the HTML for you.

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.180 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I think that's a big hang-up for people
coming from jQuery and other libraries

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:39.090 line:100% position:50% align:middle
like that, where they want to just touch
the HTML directly. But with React,

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:44.830 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you edit the data and React will edit the
HTML for you. So case in point here,

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:50.210 line:100% position:50% align:middle
if I go to my React DevTools here, this is
the finished one, and I go to my app,

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.700 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you see that we have the fishes state.
Now, it's going to go fish1 and I'm going

00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:00.360 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to change that from Pacific to Atlantic,
so I am changing state right now.

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:06.150 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I'm not worried about what h3, what class
is on here, and here.

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:08.710 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And here you see it's referenced three
times throughout the application.

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:13.360 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I'm not worried about updating every
single piece of that. I just changed my

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:18.030 line:100% position:50% align:middle
state, which is just an object, and when I
hit enter, you see it's updated it

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:23.660 line:100% position:50% align:middle
wherever I have pulled on state. Huge idea
behind React, it's really,

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.180 line:100% position:50% align:middle
really nice because you don't have to
worry about, where is it happening and

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
what do I have to update? You've got all
of these balls in the air.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.200 line:100% position:50% align:middle
You simply just update state and
everything else that you've modeled out

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.280 line:100% position:50% align:middle
with your JSX will update.

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.220 line:100% position:50% align:middle
What we are going to do now is we are
going to create this form right here.

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.370 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I'm going to call that the "Add Fish"
form, where you put fish name,

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.180 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you put a price, you put a description,
you put a URL to the image,

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:51.170 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and when I click "Add image"...let's try
it. Crabs, it's going to be $50,

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:56.750 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it's going to be fresh, it’s going to be
really good. And then we put an image URL

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:02.670 line:100% position:50% align:middle
in there, I've got a fishpic1. And when
I add the item... Bam!

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:07.840 line:100% position:50% align:middle
It adds it to my state. Again, if I pop
open my DevTools here,

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:14.610 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we go to React, we look for our App
component, and you'll see we have state

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:17.460 line:100% position:50% align:middle
here. The first fish, that's the fish
right there. This is just a key.

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:21.110 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I'll explain that in a second. But there's
"Really good," it's crabs,

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:24.730 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it's that much, I can go ahead and add the
crabs to my order. If I were to then

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:31.560 line:100% position:50% align:middle
change any of the price as well, it would
be no problem. Everything will be updated

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:32.450 line:100% position:50% align:middle
for me.

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:35.860 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Cool! That's what you want to do. This
right here, you might think,

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:39.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"Okay, let's open up Inventory." Actually,
let's go ahead and do that.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.420 line:100% position:50% align:middle
First of all, this paragraph should
probably be in the h2 tag,

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:48.010 line:100% position:50% align:middle
so we're going to put this here. Well,
we’ve got Inventory...and you might think

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:53.320 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we can just pop a form element here.
However, that add fish form,

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:56.910 line:100% position:50% align:middle
yeah, it's in Inventory now, but what if I
wanted to put it somewhere else?

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:01.320 line:100% position:50% align:middle
It's probably not good just to tie it to
my Inventory directly.

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:05.150 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We probably want to make a separate
component for it, so let’s go into our

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:13.050 line:100% position:50% align:middle
components folder and we'll make
"AddFishForm.js." Again, just take one of

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:17.850 line:100% position:50% align:middle
your other components, paste it in and
replace every instance of that old

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:22.860 line:100% position:50% align:middle
component name with the new one, which is
AddFishForm. Cool.

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:27.160 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now, let's just test that it works. We're
going to go into our Inventory component

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:34.530 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and I need that AddFishForm, so import
AddFishForm from...there we go.

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:42.430 line:100% position:50% align:middle
AddFishForm. Now, if everything has worked
properly, we should now see AddFishForm in

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:49.560 line:100% position:50% align:middle
here. Not seeing it. Let me refresh. Not
seeing it. Let's check our console here.

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:53.800 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We've got one error here, "Warning
'AddFishForm' is defined but not used."

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:58.730 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Oh, what did I do? I didn't use it. I
imported it, but if you want to use it,

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:04.450 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you have to pop in a AddFishForm tag. Now,
we said that we can't return two adjacent

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:07.550 line:100% position:50% align:middle
elements. Here, I'll show you. I'll save
it and it’ll yell at us for doing two

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:11.220 line:100% position:50% align:middle
adjacent elements. Here we go. Adjacent
JSX elements must be wrapped in an

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:16.650 line:100% position:50% align:middle
enclosing tag. So what do we do with that?
We give ourselves a div and put the things

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:23.120 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that we want inside of there. Good.
AddFishForm is now popping up.

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:27.960 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We open our React DevTools, we should see
the AddFishForm element popping up.

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:32.840 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We have no standard props in that. But
what we are going to do is go into here,

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:38.060 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and we are going to create a form element.
There's going to be no action on that form

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:38.730 line:100% position:50% align:middle
element.

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:44.550 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And that form will have a class name of
"fish-edit," and inside of this form,

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:49.740 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we then need a whole whack of inputs,
right? If we look back at what we have,

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:55.680 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we need name, price, status, description,
URL to image, and an add item button.

00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:00.540 line:100% position:50% align:middle
How does that work? Well, I've got all the
names right here, and I'm just going to

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:10.910 line:100% position:50% align:middle
quickly make an input...the type of text
and the placeholder, whatever it is.

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:18.090 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Good! We need a button with the type of
"submit," and inside of that we're going

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:23.670 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to say, plus "Add Item." Let's see how
we're looking here. Good.

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:29.430 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Looks okay, but this fish status should
actually be a select, so we'll do a select

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:37.070 line:100% position:50% align:middle
tag instead. I don't need a name or an ID.
Inside of that, we have an option,

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:46.330 line:100% position:50% align:middle
which is available, and we'll call that
"Fresh!" We’ll have "unavailable" and that

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:55.750 line:100% position:50% align:middle
will be "Sold Out!" We don't need this
here. Save. Fish Price,

00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:59.100 line:100% position:50% align:middle
looking a little bit funny, what are we
missing here? Oh, description.

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:05.570 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We forgot the description. Which is not
input type of text, but is a textarea.

00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:09.800 line:100% position:50% align:middle
There we go. Name, price, fresh or sold
out, description, image,

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:14.370 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and then add item. So that is the form
that we've then filled out.

00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:19.970 line:100% position:50% align:middle
But when someone clicks this "Add Item,"
we actually want to create a fish object

00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:24.630 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that takes all of this data and puts it
into an object for us.

00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:28.720 line:100% position:50% align:middle
For that, what we're going to do is we're
going to make a method here called

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:35.540 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"createFish," and that again, is going to
pass in the event. And when somebody

00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:42.480 line:100% position:50% align:middle
submits this thing, say "onSubmit=" exact
same thing that we did on our Store

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:45.490 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Picker, let's take a look at that. On our
Store Picker we said,

00:07:45.490 --> 00:07:54.650 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"onSubmit= this.goTostore", so "onSubmit=
e.createFish." So when someone submits

00:07:54.650 --> 00:07:58.270 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that, we're going to go here, and we're
going to call "event.preventDefault" and

00:07:58.270 --> 00:08:06.310 line:100% position:50% align:middle
let's just "console.log"… “Gonna make some
fish!" Some fish emoji,

00:08:06.310 --> 00:08:10.830 line:100% position:50% align:middle
let's see here. Tons of fish emojis.
That's a good one.

00:08:10.830 --> 00:08:17.370 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Where are we at right now? When I go to my
console, add item, “Gonna make some fish!”

00:08:17.370 --> 00:08:22.640 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Good! Now, the question is, when I type
into one of these boxes or all of them and

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:27.430 line:100% position:50% align:middle
hit "Add Item," how do I then take the
text out of these inputs and selects and

00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:31.460 line:100% position:50% align:middle
textarea, and put it into an object?
Because what I want here is,

00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:35.240 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I want to make a fish object. And that
fish is going to have a name,

00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:40.030 line:100% position:50% align:middle
a price, a status, a description, and an
image. So how do I then do that?

00:08:40.030 --> 00:08:44.340 line:100% position:50% align:middle
How did we do it before? We used refs for
that. So I’m going to go down here and say

00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:53.430 line:100% position:50% align:middle
input, input, select, textarea, input, and
if we want actual refs for them,

00:08:53.430 --> 00:09:00.060 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we say, "ref=," and we use an arrow
function in-line here, and that has the

00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:04.030 line:100% position:50% align:middle
input, then we'll say "this." and then I'm
just going to say, name,

00:09:04.030 --> 00:09:11.940 line:100% position:50% align:middle
price, status, description, and image,
equals "input". That will allow us to

00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:19.250 line:100% position:50% align:middle
have...let me comment this out. Let's
double check. Save. I go to my React

00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:24.900 line:100% position:50% align:middle
DevTools, we're going to find the
"AddFishForm" component, and we're going

00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:33.700 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to look at it in the console, "$r." If I
open that sucker up, you'll see we've got

00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:39.710 line:100% position:50% align:middle
image, description, we’ve got all of these
values, references to these inputs here,

00:09:39.710 --> 00:09:49.020 line:100% position:50% align:middle
on our actual this. So we can go back to
this right here and say,

00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:54.810 line:100% position:50% align:middle
".this." and the actual name of it,
because that's the name of the input as

00:09:54.810 --> 00:10:00.250 line:100% position:50% align:middle
well, that's what we did, ".value," right?
Hopefully, that will make us a fish object

00:10:00.250 --> 00:10:06.190 line:100% position:50% align:middle
if we "console.log" the fish after that.
Go fill this sucker out.

00:10:06.190 --> 00:10:15.040 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Hi, 1000, Fresh! Testing, fishpic1, and I
add the item. Awesome!

00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:20.140 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Gonna make a fish! And then it creates us
this nice, tidy little fish object,

00:10:20.140 --> 00:10:25.450 line:100% position:50% align:middle
which we can then send on over to our
state, so let's look at how we can do that

00:10:25.450 --> 00:10:26.500 line:100% position:50% align:middle
next.

00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:30.410 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now that we have this fish object, how do
we actually get it into our application or

00:10:30.410 --> 00:10:35.860 line:100% position:50% align:middle
into our state? Now, earlier, I showed you
that the state we are going to use is tied

00:10:35.860 --> 00:10:40.920 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to our App component. Your state is always
tied to a specific component.

00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:46.030 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And each component can have its own state.
However, sometimes when a component needs

00:10:46.030 --> 00:10:50.070 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to share a state with other
components...in our example, we have an

00:10:50.070 --> 00:10:54.170 line:100% position:50% align:middle
App component, and we're going to need to
share the data with our order,

00:10:54.170 --> 00:10:57.590 line:100% position:50% align:middle
our Inventory, as well as the listing of
all of the fish here,

00:10:57.590 --> 00:11:00.540 line:100% position:50% align:middle
right? Because state is referenced here.
It's referenced here.

00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:04.150 line:100% position:50% align:middle
As well as it's referenced right here. So
what I'm going to do is I'm going to put

00:11:04.150 --> 00:11:08.610 line:100% position:50% align:middle
my state on our App component, which is
sort of like the parent of all three of

00:11:08.610 --> 00:11:13.630 line:100% position:50% align:middle
these ones right here. And then we are
going to pass it on down to it.

00:11:13.630 --> 00:11:17.710 line:100% position:50% align:middle
How do you use state on a React component?
Well, first of all,

00:11:17.710 --> 00:11:22.050 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we need to do something, it's called "get
initial state." React needs to know what

00:11:22.050 --> 00:11:25.100 line:100% position:50% align:middle
state you're going to have, what type of
state it's going to be,

00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:29.680 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and really, what to expect. So what we
need to do is, when this App component

00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:33.090 line:100% position:50% align:middle
initializes, we need to tell it that we're
going to have a fishes state,

00:11:33.090 --> 00:11:39.120 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and an order state. And how we do that in
this ES6 class is via a constructor

00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:44.620 line:100% position:50% align:middle
method. So we used a constructor method
earlier. We just simply add one here.

00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:48.590 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And inside of this constructor, we first
need to call "super." Again,

00:11:48.590 --> 00:11:53.580 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we cannot use the keyword "this" until we
call super again because the React

00:11:53.580 --> 00:11:57.870 line:100% position:50% align:middle
component that we're extending needs to be
initialized first. And then we simply say

00:11:57.870 --> 00:12:02.160 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"this.state =" and state is one big object
like I told you here.

00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:06.740 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And inside of that state, we are going to
have our two pieces of state.

00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:10.600 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we're going to have the fishes
state...and by the way, don't email me,

00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:15.810 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that is correct. I know you think fish is
plural, but if you have multiple types of

00:12:15.810 --> 00:12:20.630 line:100% position:50% align:middle
one fish, it is fishes, so don't email me
giving me heck. Some people actually did

00:12:20.630 --> 00:12:25.820 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that. And what type is it going to be?
Well, some people might use,

00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:29.760 line:100% position:50% align:middle
like, an array, and you want to keep your
fishes incremental, or you can use an

00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:32.900 line:100% position:50% align:middle
object. So for simplicity's sake, I'm
going to be using an object here and our

00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:36.980 line:100% position:50% align:middle
keys are just going to be based on 1, 2,
3, as well as timestamps.

00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:38.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I'll show you that in a second.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.320 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So it's going to be an empty object,
because we’re going to start with no

00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:44.500 line:100% position:50% align:middle
state, it's going to be empty. And then
we're also going to have an order state,

00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:49.420 line:100% position:50% align:middle
which is going to be an empty object as
well. If we save that and head back to our

00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:54.910 line:100% position:50% align:middle
App, and go to our React DevTools, and
find App here, you'll see...ha-ha!

00:12:54.910 --> 00:13:00.030 line:100% position:50% align:middle
There's our state, it's empty. There's
nothing in there, but we now have our

00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:07.690 line:100% position:50% align:middle
initial state. Maybe we'll put a little
comment in there. And that is also called

00:13:07.690 --> 00:13:11.860 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"getinitialState" if you're using the
React create class. However,

00:13:11.860 --> 00:13:15.860 line:100% position:50% align:middle
this is how you do it with ES6 classes.
It's sort of the way forward.

00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:22.360 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now, we've got our fish here in
AddFishForm, and we've got our state here.

00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:28.870 line:100% position:50% align:middle
How does the fish swim upstream to get to
our "App.js"? Well, first of all,

00:13:28.870 --> 00:13:35.170 line:100% position:50% align:middle
what we need to do is make a method on our
App called "addFish()",

00:13:35.170 --> 00:13:41.080 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and that's going to take one argument,
it's going to be fish. And inside of this,

00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:46.770 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we need to then do a couple of things. We
need to update our state and then we need

00:13:46.770 --> 00:13:51.160 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to set state. You might think that this is
probably the easiest thing ever because

00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:55.883 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you just say something like
"this.state.fishes" and maybe like

00:13:55.883 --> 00:14:01.161 line:100% position:50% align:middle
".fish1 =" and then we'll say "fish"
right? Like, that's it. You update your

00:14:01.161 --> 00:14:04.084 line:100% position:50% align:middle
object, you move on with your life.
However, with React, it's actually a lot

00:14:04.084 --> 00:14:06.330 line:100% position:50% align:middle
more complicated than that, and
this is something that I got, like,

00:14:06.330 --> 00:14:11.460 line:100% position:50% align:middle
really hung-up on when I was first
learning React is when you want to update

00:14:11.460 --> 00:14:15.570 line:100% position:50% align:middle
state, there's a couple things that we
need to do. First of all,

00:14:15.570 --> 00:14:19.810 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you can directly update your state by
doing something like this,

00:14:19.810 --> 00:14:24.960 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"this.state.fishes.fish1 =" the fish that
got passed in. However,

00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:29.640 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it is a best practice to first take a copy
of your current state,

00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:34.800 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and then update your actual state. And the
reason, after some research and talking to

00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:38.430 line:100% position:50% align:middle
a whole bunch of people is that this is
done entirely for performance,

00:14:38.430 --> 00:14:42.410 line:100% position:50% align:middle
as well as you don't want to accidentally
update a couple state and have a race

00:14:42.410 --> 00:14:45.760 line:100% position:50% align:middle
condition between other things. So it's a
bit of a run-around to do it,

00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:48.710 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and I'm just going to leave that there,
because you can do that.

00:14:48.710 --> 00:14:52.970 line:100% position:50% align:middle
However, what we want to do is first, take
a copy of the state.

00:14:52.970 --> 00:14:57.080 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And the way that I'm going to do it is I’m
going to say, "const fishes =" and I'm

00:14:57.080 --> 00:15:06.070 line:100% position:50% align:middle
going to do this, "...this.state.fishes."
Now, what is this? What's going on?

00:15:06.070 --> 00:15:09.450 line:100% position:50% align:middle
First of all, "this.state.fishes" is our
existing fishes state,

00:15:09.450 --> 00:15:12.910 line:100% position:50% align:middle
so if I had six fishes in there already,
what that's going to do is we're going to

00:15:12.910 --> 00:15:17.620 line:100% position:50% align:middle
take each of the fishes from our existing
state and put them into a new one.

00:15:17.620 --> 00:15:22.570 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now, this "..." this is a spread, and you
may be familiar with the spread from my

00:15:22.570 --> 00:15:28.110 line:100% position:50% align:middle
ES6 videos, however, we only have ever
used a spread with an array,

00:15:28.110 --> 00:15:32.220 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and into a function. But what this will do
is it will take every item from our

00:15:32.220 --> 00:15:37.080 line:100% position:50% align:middle
object, this is the ES6...or sorry...it’s
not part of ES6, and that’s coming to the

00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:43.390 line:100% position:50% align:middle
language very soon. It will take every
item from our object and spread it into

00:15:43.390 --> 00:15:48.200 line:100% position:50% align:middle
this object. So that's a long way of
saying this takes a copy of your existing

00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:53.370 line:100% position:50% align:middle
state and puts it into this new fishes
state. And then what we'll do is we will

00:15:53.370 --> 00:15:55.840 line:100% position:50% align:middle
add in our new fish.

00:15:55.840 --> 00:16:01.260 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now, if we take a look at our example
here, you'll see, like, this is how I've

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:06.320 line:100% position:50% align:middle
named all of our fishes. Fish one through
nine, those are just temporary ones that

00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:10.380 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we're going to load in some sample fishes
and get those. But whenever we add a new

00:16:10.380 --> 00:16:14.120 line:100% position:50% align:middle
one, it gives us this seemingly random
number that we have here.

00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:18.630 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And I'm going to be using a timestamp
here. First of all, a timestamp is going

00:16:18.630 --> 00:16:24.450 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to be unique, as well as it's going to be
incremental, so every time I add a new one

00:16:24.450 --> 00:16:28.980 line:100% position:50% align:middle
on, it's going to go to the top of it. You
can use an array and maintain your order

00:16:28.980 --> 00:16:32.260 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and stuff like that, but really, for
simplicity's sake here, I'm going to be

00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:38.040 line:100% position:50% align:middle
using a timestamp as the key of the
fishes, so that I can keep adding

00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:43.910 line:100% position:50% align:middle
additional ones in. So I'll say "fishes,"
square bracket, and I want to say,

00:16:43.910 --> 00:16:49.650 line:100% position:50% align:middle
like, "[fish-1]," "[fish-2]," "[fish-3],"
however, I need a timestamp for that.

00:16:49.650 --> 00:16:55.190 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So first, we're going to make a timestamp,
say "const timestamp =,” and then we’ll

00:16:55.190 --> 00:16:59.210 line:100% position:50% align:middle
say, "Date.now." That will give us...if
you've never used that before,

00:16:59.210 --> 00:17:02.570 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it's something that's somewhat new to
JavaScript, it will just give you the

00:17:02.570 --> 00:17:05.810 line:100% position:50% align:middle
timestamp. And this is the number of
milliseconds since January 1st,

00:17:05.810 --> 00:17:09.310 line:100% position:50% align:middle
1970, something like that. And it's always
going to be unique,

00:17:09.310 --> 00:17:13.410 line:100% position:50% align:middle
unless you, of course, add two fishes in
the same millisecond.

00:17:13.410 --> 00:17:19.710 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we've done that "Date.now," and then we
go back to our fishes,

00:17:19.710 --> 00:17:23.870 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and we'll say, "fishes," square bracket,
and I'll use backticks,

00:17:23.870 --> 00:17:31.350 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"[fish-]" and then I'll use the timestamp
in here, equals, and then we pass in that

00:17:31.350 --> 00:17:35.840 line:100% position:50% align:middle
fish, because what we're going to do is
we're going to take this fish object that

00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:42.530 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we made here and pass it to this addFish
method here. Fish. So that's the first

00:17:42.530 --> 00:17:45.840 line:100% position:50% align:middle
part of it. So we have this object of
updated fishes, however,

00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:51.070 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it's not yet been set to our actual state.
And the way that you do that is you

00:17:51.070 --> 00:17:56.380 line:100% position:50% align:middle
explicitly tell React which state you
would like to update. So rather than React

00:17:56.380 --> 00:18:01.670 line:100% position:50% align:middle
watching your huge state object and
anytime you make a change to it,

00:18:01.670 --> 00:18:06.910 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it will then update your DOM. What we have
to do is we tell React,

00:18:06.910 --> 00:18:11.570 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"Okay, I updated this piece of state." So
what we do is we say,

00:18:11.570 --> 00:18:17.920 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"this.setState" and you don't just pass it
your entire state, because you might have

00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:22.090 line:100% position:50% align:middle
five or six different things in your
state, and React doesn't want to have to

00:18:22.090 --> 00:18:26.700 line:100% position:50% align:middle
check every single one of them if you, the
developer, know what has changed.

00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:30.200 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So in our case, what is the one piece that
has changed? We've passed in an object,

00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:35.520 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it's fishes, right? So we say, the fishes
state has changed, and here is the new

00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:41.160 line:100% position:50% align:middle
updated state. What is that? We put it in
a variable called fishes.

00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:47.700 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So the fishes state is updated. Here is an
object full of all of the existing as well

00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:52.760 line:100% position:50% align:middle
as my new fishes. And what React is going
to then do, any time I make a change to

00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:58.760 line:100% position:50% align:middle
any one of these, like Crabs is going to
be changed to Fish, any time that happens,

00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:02.530 line:100% position:50% align:middle
React will find anywhere in the DOM that
you've then used that piece of state,

00:19:02.530 --> 00:19:07.540 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and it's going to update it. That's what
the whole virtual DOM thing is behind React.

00:19:07.540 --> 00:19:13.210 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now, a little thing that we can do here is
in ES6 if you have "fishes:fishes," it

00:19:13.210 --> 00:19:17.920 line:100% position:50% align:middle
seems a little bit redundant, so you can
actually just pass fishes like that.

00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:22.150 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And that's the same thing as doing this.
So we've built out this addFish method,

00:19:22.150 --> 00:19:27.220 line:100% position:50% align:middle
but if we go to our React DevTools and
search for App, and take a look at it and

00:19:27.220 --> 00:19:32.560 line:100% position:50% align:middle
go back to our console, use our "$r" to
see where we're at. You open it up,

00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:38.590 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and don't see the addFish method anywhere
on it, and that's because this addFish has

00:19:38.590 --> 00:19:46.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
not yet been added to this. So we need to
do it up in our constructor here.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:53.960 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We'll say, "this.addFish =
this.addFish.bind(this).” And that will

00:19:53.960 --> 00:20:02.870 line:100% position:50% align:middle
bind it to the actual App itself. And if
we React, find our App component here,

00:20:02.870 --> 00:20:08.190 line:100% position:50% align:middle
now, you will then see that we have our
addFish function added to us.

00:20:08.190 --> 00:20:11.620 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And we can actually just call it ourselves
if we would want to,

00:20:11.620 --> 00:20:19.980 line:100% position:50% align:middle
so ".addFish" and you could pass it a name
of "cool" and a price of $50,

00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:26.260 line:100% position:50% align:middle
let's just try it with those two things.
When I add it, nothing happens,

00:20:26.260 --> 00:20:30.920 line:100% position:50% align:middle
but if we go back to our React DevTools,
open up our state, ha-ha!

00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:36.110 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Yes! Look at this, we've got our first
state has been added. So that method,

00:20:36.110 --> 00:20:39.880 line:100% position:50% align:middle
addFish can be called, you pass it a fish,
and then behind the scenes,

00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:42.950 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it's going to do all of this, like, sort
of complicated copying the state,

00:20:42.950 --> 00:20:46.780 line:100% position:50% align:middle
updating it, making a timestamp for all of
that good stuff, etc.etc.

00:20:46.780 --> 00:20:52.210 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So really the last thing we need to do now
is when someone...at this point,

00:20:52.210 --> 00:20:56.570 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we have this fish object, how do we swim
upstream? Such a stupid thing to say,

00:20:56.570 --> 00:21:02.560 line:100% position:50% align:middle
but how do we swim upstream with the fish
to App.js? Well, this is where props

00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:09.390 line:100% position:50% align:middle
starts to come in. So I have this addFish
function. How do I call it from a child

00:21:09.390 --> 00:21:14.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
component? That's a couple levels deep.
Well, the way that we do it is we go to

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:20.030 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Inventory, and we’ll just say, “addFish=
this.addFish," so we're passing the

00:21:20.030 --> 00:21:27.300 line:100% position:50% align:middle
function then on down to Inventory. And
then if we...let me show you now.

00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:36.640 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We go to our App component and open up our
Inventory component,

00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:43.110 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and you see that this addFish function has
now been passed down via props.

00:21:43.110 --> 00:21:47.220 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And then we got to go one level more,
because we have to open up our Inventory

00:21:47.220 --> 00:21:51.800 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and we have to pass it. So we’ll say,
“addFish =,” and now it's not

00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:58.500 line:100% position:50% align:middle
“this.addFish," it's "this.props.addFish."
Why? Because the way that you pass things

00:21:58.500 --> 00:22:02.800 line:100% position:50% align:middle
down, whether it's data or reference to
this addFish function,

00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:12.980 line:100% position:50% align:middle
is we do that via props. Now, giving that
a save, and if we open up our AddFishForm,

00:22:12.980 --> 00:22:17.680 line:100% position:50% align:middle
aha! It's now available. Now we can access
this addFish function inside of our

00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:27.710 line:100% position:50% align:middle
AddFishForm, and all we have to do now is
"this.props.addFish" and we'll pass it our

00:22:27.710 --> 00:22:35.740 line:100% position:50% align:middle
actual fish. So let's try that and see if
it works. Wes, 100, something,

00:22:35.740 --> 00:22:41.580 line:100% position:50% align:middle
something, go to our console, add item,
"Gonna make some fish." Now we go back to

00:22:41.580 --> 00:22:47.910 line:100% position:50% align:middle
our React DevTools, search for App, now
for state, ha-ha! There it is!

00:22:47.910 --> 00:22:51.510 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Awesome! We just added that actual element
here.

00:22:51.510 --> 00:22:58.130 line:100% position:50% align:middle
One last thing that we could do is, when
we submit that, we actually want to clear

00:22:58.130 --> 00:23:03.949 line:100% position:50% align:middle
this form so that it's empty. So we can
put a ref on the form itself, say

00:23:03.949 --> 00:23:15.328 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"ref=(input)" say, "this.fishForm=input"
and then we'll go up here,

00:23:15.328 --> 00:23:21.140 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and we'll say, "this.fishForm.reset."
That's just using a regular old JavaScript

00:23:21.140 --> 00:23:28.140 line:100% position:50% align:middle
reset, so that when I type something in
here, add it, it clears out the fish,

00:23:28.140 --> 00:23:33.630 line:100% position:50% align:middle
but we also should now have that state in
our fishes. Good! Whew!

00:23:33.630 --> 00:23:38.410 line:100% position:50% align:middle
That is an introduction to state. We’re
going to be using it a lot more.

00:23:38.410 --> 00:23:42.350 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We're going to be doing that a few more
times, but it's sort of a fundamental

00:23:42.350 --> 00:23:47.270 line:100% position:50% align:middle
feature of React, so make sure that that
feels pretty good to you right now.

00:23:47.270 --> 00:23:51.130 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And then in the next one we're going to
look at how do we load some default state

00:23:51.130 --> 00:23:54.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
in and how do we actually get state to
start displaying.
