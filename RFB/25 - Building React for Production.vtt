Now we've pretty much finished up building
our application, but there's a lot more

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:15.080 line:100% position:50% align:middle
in terms of how do we actually deploy
this application and get it running in

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:19.370 line:100% position:50% align:middle
production? So, luckily for us Create
React App, which is what we have used so

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:24.260 line:100% position:50% align:middle
far, has a build step. If you open up your
package.json, you will see there is a

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:29.260 line:100% position:50% align:middle
script called build and we simply just
have to run. If you open up your terminal

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:34.880 line:100% position:50% align:middle
here, npm run build, and what that's going
to do is it's going to compress it,

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.940 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it's going to remove all the stuff out of
React that we don't necessarily need.

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:44.250 line:100% position:50% align:middle
It's going to minify it and uglify it, all
of that good stuff that we're used to and

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.720 line:100% position:50% align:middle
make us a tiny little JavaScript file, as
well as take our CSS out and put it into

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:54.410 line:100% position:50% align:middle
its own file. So, there we have it. It ran
npm run build and after that we've got a

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:59.150 line:100% position:50% align:middle
couple little tiny...a CSS file,
a JavaScript file, and an index.html.

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:02.200 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Then it also gives us some information
here on how to serve it.

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.510 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And, I'm going to go over the next couple
videos with you, show you how to get that

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:10.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
online. But, let's just take a quick look
at that build folder here.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.130 line:100% position:50% align:middle
You'll see inside of it is the index.html,
which is very small and then inside of our

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:20.550 line:100% position:50% align:middle
static, we've got our CSS. And then, we
also have a css.map, and that's the source

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:25.310 line:100% position:50% align:middle
map, so that if there's ever an issue with
our CSS, we can see where we actually

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.800 line:100% position:50% align:middle
authored it, like in our animations.style
file. Same goes for our javascript file,

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:36.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it's one big file, however, if you look
inside of that, the map file's going to

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.510 line:100% position:50% align:middle
point you towards the actual components
where we wrote it. And then,

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:42.940 line:100% position:50% align:middle
in the media, I've got just a couple fonts
that we need here, and then the anchor

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:48.120 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that we used in our main file. So, that's
pretty much all we need,

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:54.010 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it's just an index.html and stack, there's
no server that comes along with it.

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:59.580 line:100% position:50% align:middle
If I were to open that up in my browser
here, you'll notice that it doesn't work.

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:05.420 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Right? There's some errors and everything.
And, even if you were to push that up to

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:12.550 line:100% position:50% align:middle
some server and surf to index.html, what
happens is that when you're on index.html

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:17.070 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it's actually fine, but when you go to a
secondary page, like

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:22.520 line:100% position:50% align:middle
store/defeatedobnoxiouschildren, the
browser thinks you're in a folder called

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:26.600 line:100% position:50% align:middle
store and a folder called defeated
obnoxious children. And, if you were then

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.370 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to refresh that, there's no index.html
inside of that folder.

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:36.630 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So, we need some sort of server that is
essentially going to serve this index.html

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:42.600 line:100% position:50% align:middle
up, regardless of what URL the user
requested and we'll say, don't worry about

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.050 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it, we're going to let the browser
figure out all of our routing.

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:49.310 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So, I'm going to show you a few different
methods to actually do that.

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:54.250 line:100% position:50% align:middle
The first one is now.sh, the second one is
going to be Github pages, and then the

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:59.252 line:100% position:50% align:middle
third one, I'm going to just show you how
to just throw it up on any existing server

00:02:59.252 --> 00:03:03.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that you might have, like a PHP server,
that's a couple bucks a month.
