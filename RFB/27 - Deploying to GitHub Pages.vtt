Another way that we can host our
applications is on GitHub Pages.

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:15.430 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now, this probably isn't the greatest way
to host your application because it uses a

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:18.220 line:100% position:50% align:middle
bit of a hack, and we'll go into that in
just a second. However,

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:21.250 line:100% position:50% align:middle
if you just need to get something online,
if you want to show it to other people,

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:23.520 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it's free hosting and it's
really easy to do.

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:29.920 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So, what I've done here is set up a new
blank GitHub repo, and I'm going to go to

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:37.090 line:100% position:50% align:middle
my Sublime Text and open up my Terminal.
Now before we actually run npm run

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:42.670 line:100% position:50% align:middle
build, what happens is that, this
"getting-fishy" is going to be my repo

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:48.660 line:100% position:50% align:middle
name and "wesbos" is my GitHub name. So
the effective URL for this is going to be

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:56.610 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"wesbos.github.io/getting-fishy" and
what's different about that is not that

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.350 line:100% position:50% align:middle
there's a subdomain...that's fine...but
what's different about that is that it's

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:07.032 line:100% position:50% align:middle
going to be running sort of in a subfolder
where "getting-fishy/store/clean-children"

00:01:07.032 --> 00:01:11.542 line:100% position:50% align:middle
or something like that, right? So this
part, how do we account for that.

00:01:11.542 --> 00:01:16.639 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So far it's always just been
"/store/clean-kitchen." So what we need to

00:01:16.639 --> 00:01:18.792 line:100% position:50% align:middle
do is a couple things here.

00:01:18.792 --> 00:01:24.830 line:100% position:50% align:middle
First of all, we need to go into our
package.json and specify a home page.

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:30.140 line:100% position:50% align:middle
This is going to tell create React app
where to make the link path.

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:34.220 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So, we are going to add a home page, and
then you need to type in

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:39.140 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"wesbos.github.io" or obviously your repo
here .../the repo name. That's

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:44.520 line:100% position:50% align:middle
really important because when we get back
to these URLs here, our CSS isn't going to

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:55.180 line:100% position:50% align:middle
be "/static/style.css" It's going to be
"/getting-fishy/static/style.css." So it's

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:59.350 line:100% position:50% align:middle
really important that we add that home
page parameter here and create React app,

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:03.890 line:100% position:50% align:middle
when we run build, is going to take
that into account when creating its URL.

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:09.500 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So, no problem there. However, we also
need to open up our index.js and we need

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:15.570 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to modify our React router here to run in
a subfolder. If you've ever tried to run

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:20.700 line:100% position:50% align:middle
React router before in a subfolder, you
know that it just pushes it to forward

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.470 line:100% position:50% align:middle
slash. And we need to tell it that
everything is going to be living at

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:29.730 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"/getting-fishy." So the way that we do
that is we say "basename=" and

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.060 line:100% position:50% align:middle
then "/getting-fishy/."

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:36.770 line:100% position:50% align:middle
One little trick that I've done before is
that I'll create a quick variable from the

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:42.130 line:100% position:50% align:middle
URL. So I'll say "const repo =" some
back text, and I'm just going to take...

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:53.360 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Let's say I'm at this URL right here. I've
got [removed].pathname.

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:59.200 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And what you can do is you can split that
on a forward slash, and you can grab the

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.810 line:100% position:50% align:middle
second item, and that's going to give you
the repo name. In this case,

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:08.960 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it says "wesbos," but if it was
"/getting-fishy/storeid" then it would

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:11.090 line:100% position:50% align:middle
give me "getting-fishy."

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:19.650 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I'm going to take the
[removed].pathname.split, and then

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:24.180 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I'll grab the second thing that comes in,
and that will only work for GitHub Pages

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:29.380 line:100% position:50% align:middle
because GitHub Pages is always going to be
"your username.github.io/the repo

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:35.130 line:100% position:50% align:middle
name." So that's the repo. Then we can
just pop the repo into there.

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:36.750 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Here. Good.

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:42.200 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So, now we need to go back to our iTerm
here and run "npm run build." That is

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:46.940 line:100% position:50% align:middle
going to create a build directory so cd
into build. I'm going to initialize a git

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:52.810 line:100% position:50% align:middle
repo. I'm going to add the
remote, git add -A

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:54.810 line:100% position:50% align:middle
git commit - m.
I'm going to put a fish

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:04.300 line:100% position:50% align:middle
in my commit. And then I'm going to push
everything up to the master branch.

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:07.840 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Good. Again, I only did that with the
build directory, not the entire

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:11.060 line:100% position:50% align:middle
catch-of-the-day. If you already have a
repo in catch-of-the-day,

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:15.160 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you can create what's called a git sub
module where you can just have a separate

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:18.710 line:100% position:50% align:middle
git repo for that specific build folder.

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:22.250 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So, now, if I refresh this getting fishy,
I have my master branch with my

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:29.160 line:100% position:50% align:middle
index.html. If you go to settings, scroll
down, and under Github Pages you can set

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:35.350 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it to be your master branch.
It will then give you a URL:

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:41.440 line:100% position:50% align:middle
wesbos.github.io/getting-fishy. Then you
can go to that URL and your application is

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:42.370 line:100% position:50% align:middle
working.

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:46.620 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So let's try it out, visit the store. It's
not going to work just yet if I try

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:52.440 line:100% position:50% align:middle
logging in because I need to add github.io
to my Firebase. I'll do that in a second.

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:58.100 line:100% position:50% align:middle
But the problem is... Watch when I
refresh: we get a GitHub 404.

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:03.010 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And that's because GitHub doesn't know
that there's a folder called "store" and a

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:06.260 line:100% position:50% align:middle
folder called
"old-fashioned-mysterious-teeth."

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:10.860 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Also, GitHub doesn't really offer any
routing at all. They only offer you two

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:15.920 line:100% position:50% align:middle
things: an index.html, which we took
advantage of right here.

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:20.070 line:100% position:50% align:middle
However, when we change the URL with push
date and someone refreshes,

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:26.868 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it hits a 404. So sort of the hack we can
do here is rename our index.html to

00:05:26.868 --> 00:05:28.510 line:100% position:50% align:middle
be also 404.

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:34.620 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So, if I copy the index to be 404.html,
and you can see a couple things.

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:37.560 line:100% position:50% align:middle
There are some other workarounds and you
can use something called Surge and there

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:40.935 line:100% position:50% align:middle
are static build tools here. But, at the
very basic, if you just take your

00:05:40.935 --> 00:05:49.170 line:100% position:50% align:middle
index.html and dupe it over to 404, and
add it, and commit it, and push it,

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:58.280 line:100% position:50% align:middle
then when GitHub hits a 404, it's going to
serve up your index.html file in your 404.

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:04.010 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And it will actually just work for you, no
problem there. Let's check that it's in my

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:11.200 line:100% position:50% align:middle
repo here. Here we go, 404 to html.
Now we can refresh.

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:14.760 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Sometimes it takes a second on GitHub
Pages to actually work. So if it's not

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:18.030 line:100% position:50% align:middle
working for you, maybe give it a couple of
minutes. There we go.

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:23.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now when I refresh, an actual store name
is coming to it. The only downside here is

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.370 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you are technically sending the browser a
404 code, telling it that it didn't work.

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:31.230 line:100% position:50% align:middle
It did, but you're telling it that it
didn't work. So if you're doing anything

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:37.220 line:100% position:50% align:middle
with SEO or catching this page, then some
people might get confused,

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:40.060 line:100% position:50% align:middle
especially Google. So don't use this for
anything in production.

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:43.070 line:100% position:50% align:middle
But again if you want to get something up
and running, if you want client-side

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:46.960 line:100% position:50% align:middle
routing with that catch-all,
you can use 404.html.

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:50.670 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Next up, I'm going to show you how you
actually can use this on your own server,

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:54.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
whether that's an Apache
or an Nginx server.
