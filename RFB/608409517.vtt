00:00:06.977 --> 00:00:09.326 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Up until now, pretty much
anyone can just

00:00:09.326 --> 00:00:13.450 line:100% position:50% align:middle
edit or create a store and that's not
ideal if you actually want to have a real

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:18.050 line:100% position:50% align:middle
world application where you have owners of
a store and only the owner of that store

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:21.090 line:100% position:50% align:middle
would be able to edit it. So, this is the
finished application here.

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.640 line:100% position:50% align:middle
This is how it's going to work. We're
going to go to one of the stores that we

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.110 line:100% position:50% align:middle
have here and, by default, it's going to
show you nothing. You need to log in with

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:33.090 line:100% position:50% align:middle
GitHub, Facebook or Twitter. So, I'm going
to go ahead and log in with GitHub,

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.820 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and once I've logged in, the first person
to log in to that store with either one is

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.940 line:100% position:50% align:middle
going to be the owner of that actual
store, then I can go ahead and load some

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.950 line:100% position:50% align:middle
samples and add some stuff to my order.
However, if I were then to log out of

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:52.120 line:100% position:50% align:middle
here, I wouldn't be able to actually
manage that inventory. If I were then to

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:58.740 line:100% position:50% align:middle
log in with Twitter and authorize that
application, you're going to see,

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:01.440 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"Sorry, you aren't the owner of the
store," because I logged in as a different

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:08.590 line:100% position:50% align:middle
person. I can log out again, log in with
GitHub, and I'm back to being able to edit

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:13.090 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the actual store. So, we are doing
everything client-side, so how do you do

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:17.210 line:100% position:50% align:middle
authentication when it's only client-side?
That's really where Firebase comes in.

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.620 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We're going to split this into two parts.
First, we're going to,

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:23.640 line:100% position:50% align:middle
like, lock it down or pseudo lock it down
on the client side where people just won't

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.550 line:100% position:50% align:middle
be able to see this actual form to edit
it, and then we're going to actually go on

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:33.490 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the back end of Firebase and make sure
that if anyone were to sneakily be able to

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.850 line:100% position:50% align:middle
get this editing form to show, even if
they weren't the store owner,

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:39.770 line:100% position:50% align:middle
then Firebase would just reject them
because they aren't the actual store

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:41.730 line:100% position:50% align:middle
owner. So, that's what we want to do here.

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:46.320 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I'm going to close it down, and we want to
go to our Firebase here,

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:53.530 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and go to the Authentication tab, "Auth."
Then we want to add a couple different

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.580 line:100% position:50% align:middle
sign-up methods, so we're going to set up
a sign-up method, and in this tutorial,

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:59.080 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I'm going to show you how to do Facebook,
Twitter, and GitHub.

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.660 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Those are the most popular. However, you
can use email and password,

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:06.910 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and Google, and all kinds of other stuff
here. So, I'm going to turn on Facebook

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:12.270 line:100% position:50% align:middle
first. Now, what you need to do is go to
Facebook and create an application.

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:19.050 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So it's developers.facebook.com/apps and
we want to create an app called Catch of

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.670 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the Day, and we're going to put it in, how
about the Business,

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:28.130 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the fish business, and create an
application...oh, "Please select all

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:32.760 line:100% position:50% align:middle
photos which show a wristwatch." Wrist,
wrist, wrist, wrist, wristwatch.

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:40.810 line:100% position:50% align:middle
That is a waterfall. Facebook login, so
I'll click "Get Started Here," and we want

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:47.950 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to first, "Valid OAuth redirect URLs." So,
what we want to do is take this URL that

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:53.440 line:100% position:50% align:middle
they've given us, and then you need to
make sure that you actually hit enter so

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.530 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that it looks like a blue bubble.
Sometimes I always forget to do that and

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:59.970 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it does it. And, finally, "Embedded
Browser OAuth Login," you need to make

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:05.980 line:100% position:50% align:middle
sure that is checked on, scroll to the
bottom and click "Save Changes," then go

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:11.110 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to the Dashboard, and we need the
application ID, which is this right here,

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:14.740 line:100% position:50% align:middle
so I'm going to paste that into my "App
ID" here. I'm going to enable it,

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:19.360 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I guess. And, then, the Secret you also
need is...you can show it here,

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:23.850 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you can grab it. Don't ever put this in
any client-side code just because now that

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:26.550 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I've shown you this, I'm going to have to
reset them after this video.

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:29.850 line:100% position:50% align:middle
That's not something anyone should ever
see. So, I'm going to paste it in there,

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:35.040 line:100% position:50% align:middle
click "Save." Good, I've set that one up.
Now, Twitter, I want to turn on as well.

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:40.690 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I'm going to go to Twitter. I've already
created an application with Twitter,

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:46.080 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and then you can see that if I go to
Twitter, it's going to ask me for this

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:50.440 line:100% position:50% align:middle
callback URL. This callback URLs is really
important. This is not local host or

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:54.780 line:100% position:50% align:middle
anything like that. This is the actual URL
that Firebase gives you.

00:03:54.780 --> 00:04:03.370 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And I'm going to update that, then I'm
going to go to Details.

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:08.030 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I'm going to grab...actually, no, back to
Settings, or Keys and Access Tokens.

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:17.810 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Going to grab the API Key, I'm going to
grab the Secret...save that.

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:22.130 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Then, finally, GitHub, we want to turn on.
I'm going to go to GitHub and create one

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:29.450 line:100% position:50% align:middle
called "Catch of the Day," and it's going
to be wesbos.com, it's going to be "cool

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:37.210 line:100% position:50% align:middle
app," and then, again the URL, very
important here...going to grab that from

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:42.450 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Firebase here, paste that in, make sure
you don't actually copy the "CANCEL SAVE"

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:51.210 line:100% position:50% align:middle
button, register it. Good, it's going to
give us a Client ID and the Secret.

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:54.750 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So you see how we have to put all this
info into Firebase and not our app,

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:58.520 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and that's just because we can't put the
sensitive information in an application

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:02.490 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that's entirely client-side because anyone
would be able to crack it open and find

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:07.230 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that info. So, save that. Good, so I've
enabled Facebook, Twitter,

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:07.780 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and GitHub.

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:12.270 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now we need to actually write some code.
So we're going to open up our inventory

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:17.410 line:100% position:50% align:middle
component and first what we want to do is
create a method that's going to render out

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:22.690 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the buttons GitHub, Facebook, and Twitter.
So, I'm going to create a method called

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:34.150 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"renderLogin," and, then, from that, I'm
just going to return some jsx,

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:37.040 line:100% position:50% align:middle
which I'm going to paste in here and just
go over it with you real quick.

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:41.510 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So, H2 of Inventory, "Sign in to manage
your... ," we've got a button with a

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:45.110 line:100% position:50% align:middle
className of github. It's just going to
style it to be GitHub colors.

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:49.590 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Really, the only important thing here is
that "onClick" of one of these buttons,

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:52.610 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we are running a function called
"this.authenticate," which we're going to

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:56.410 line:100% position:50% align:middle
create next. That's a method. And, then,
we pass it, the method that we'd like to

00:05:56.410 --> 00:06:00.620 line:100% position:50% align:middle
authenticate. It's either going to be
GitHub, Facebook, or Twitter.

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:06.810 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Then what we want to do is go down to our
render function, and we need to do a

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:12.410 line:100% position:50% align:middle
couple different returns here. So, above
this return, we're going to say if their

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:17.160 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"!this.state.uid"...so, we are going to
store both the user ID,

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:23.030 line:100% position:50% align:middle
which is the currently logged in person,
and we are also going to store in state

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:28.240 line:100% position:50% align:middle
our application owner. So, we want to
check if the currently logged in user,

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:33.450 line:100% position:50% align:middle
which is "uid," and the current store's
owner are the same people.

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:37.400 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So, first we just want to check if there's
anyone logged in. If they're not,

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:43.970 line:100% position:50% align:middle
maybe we'll put a comment above that,
"check if they are logged in...or,

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:48.870 line:100% position:50% align:middle
check if they are not logged in at all,"
and if that is true, what we are going to

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:53.840 line:100% position:50% align:middle
do is we will return simply just a div.
Inside of that div we'll say,

00:06:53.840 --> 00:07:01.980 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"this.renderLogin." Good. And we also want
to go to our constructor here and make

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:09.360 line:100% position:50% align:middle
sure that we bind "renderLogin" so that we
can use this inside of our renderLogin

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:14.130 line:100% position:50% align:middle
function. Good, no problem there. Let's
see where we're at right now.

00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:20.270 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So, we've got a bit of an error popping up
here. Cannot read property user ID of

00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:24.950 line:100% position:50% align:middle
null. Oh, yeah, so by default, what we
also need to do in our constructor is set

00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:34.170 line:100% position:50% align:middle
a user ID and a store owner to be nothing.
So we say, "this.state =" and the user ID

00:07:34.170 --> 00:07:41.150 line:100% position:50% align:middle
is going to be null and the owner is going
to also be null. So,

00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:47.160 line:100% position:50% align:middle
explicitly nothing by default. Good, and
then, what happens here is we've got "log

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:50.680 line:100% position:50% align:middle
in GitHub, log in Facebook, log in
Twitter." If I click that, it's going to

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:53.680 line:100% position:50% align:middle
error. It's going to say that that
authentication method is not defined.

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:59.200 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Good. "this.authenticate" is not a
function. That makes sense because we have

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:03.840 line:100% position:50% align:middle
bound it to run authenticate on click, but
we have not yet actually made that

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:07.450 line:100% position:50% align:middle
authenticate method. That's fine. We'll go
over that in a second.

00:08:07.450 --> 00:08:12.200 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Then the next thing we need to do is check
if they are the owner of the current

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:18.480 line:100% position:50% align:middle
store, So, "if this.state.uid" so we're
going to be storing the user's ID and

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:26.790 line:100% position:50% align:middle
state once they log in...is not equal to
this.state.owner, then we're going to just

00:08:26.790 --> 00:08:37.300 line:100% position:50% align:middle
return some sorry div. Div, this is p,
"Sorry you aren't the owner of this

00:08:37.300 --> 00:08:42.830 line:100% position:50% align:middle
store!" Then we also need that log out
button, so I'm going to go right above

00:08:42.830 --> 00:08:52.510 line:100% position:50% align:middle
this render here and say "const logout ="
and that is simply just a button that says

00:08:52.510 --> 00:08:58.760 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"Log Out!" And, then, when someone clicks
that, we're actually going to hook it up

00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:02.540 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to our log out button, but we won't do
that just yet because we haven't created

00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:07.380 line:100% position:50% align:middle
this log out method. But, we can then take
that log out and put it right here.

00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:11.350 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Maybe someone logged in with the wrong
account, so we can put "logout" there.

00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:15.550 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And then we also probably want to put the
log out right in our inventory,

00:09:15.550 --> 00:09:18.650 line:100% position:50% align:middle
as well, because if they are logged in,
maybe they're on a shared computer,

00:09:18.650 --> 00:09:21.950 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you want to allow them to log out, as
well. So, save, let's see how we're doing

00:09:21.950 --> 00:09:28.190 line:100% position:50% align:middle
here. Good, no errors. Now, let's actually
hook up some of this work.

00:09:28.190 --> 00:09:34.100 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So, we've got that authenticate method
running so we can go ahead and code it in

00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:38.120 line:100% position:50% align:middle
ourselves, so we're going to say,
"authenticate" and that will take in a

00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:45.560 line:100% position:50% align:middle
provider, and, then when someone clicks
it, the log, "Trying to log in with

00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:50.590 line:100% position:50% align:middle
$provider." So, we made this authenticate
method. Make sure we bind it again up

00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:54.920 line:100% position:50% align:middle
here. Look, GitHub, trying to log in with
GitHub, trying to log in with Facebook,

00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:57.880 line:100% position:50% align:middle
trying to log in with Twitter. Good. So,
these buttons are working.

00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:02.710 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now we actually have to run the code that
will pop it up and try to interface with

00:10:02.710 --> 00:10:04.434 line:100% position:50% align:middle
GitHub. So, for that,

00:10:04.434 --> 00:10:09.120 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we need to import our base.
Remember, we made this "base.js," which

00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:14.190 line:100% position:50% align:middle
connected to Firebase for us? We need to
import this. So, we say,

00:10:14.190 --> 00:10:22.960 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"import base from '.. /base'." Then, when
we authenticate, we're going run "base.

00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:30.070 line:100% position:50% align:middle
AuthWithOAuthPopup."
Triple check you've got all your capitals

00:10:30.070 --> 00:10:35.070 line:100% position:50% align:middle
ready there, that's a bit of a jumble, and
then we are going to pass it.

00:10:35.070 --> 00:10:38.960 line:100% position:50% align:middle
First, what provider. So, you normally
would pass it, like, "'twitter'" or

00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:42.990 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"'facebook'" or "'github'" here, but
because we just want to make one

00:10:42.990 --> 00:10:48.700 line:100% position:50% align:middle
authenticate method here, we have popped
that into a variable called "provider."

00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:53.260 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Good. And, then, the next thing that we
want to do is, when the person

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:57.210 line:100% position:50% align:middle
successfully or unsuccessfully
authenticates, we need a callback

00:10:57.210 --> 00:11:00.660 line:100% position:50% align:middle
function. So, what is going to run as soon
as they click allow access?

00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:04.220 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And that's going to be what's called an
"authHandler," which we're going to build.

00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:09.140 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We'll say, "this.authHandler," and then
that's the next step, what we need to do,

00:11:09.140 --> 00:11:13.310 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"authHandler" and that is going to give us
an error if there is one,

00:11:13.310 --> 00:11:17.710 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and then like a payload, which I like to
call "authData." It's full of all the

00:11:17.710 --> 00:11:22.220 line:100% position:50% align:middle
information in it. And then we just,
"console.logauthData," and see where we're

00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:28.270 line:100% position:50% align:middle
at here. Let's go back up to our
constructor and we also want to duplicate,

00:11:28.270 --> 00:11:33.410 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"authenticate" is going to be
"authHandler," so you need to bind all of

00:11:33.410 --> 00:11:37.550 line:100% position:50% align:middle
these methods to that instance of the
component. Right now, click "LOG IN WITH

00:11:37.550 --> 00:11:41.790 line:100% position:50% align:middle
GITHUB," it's going to pop it open, and
it's going to ask me...the first time it's

00:11:41.790 --> 00:11:44.670 line:100% position:50% align:middle
going to ask me, the next time it's just
going to pop up and close immediately

00:11:44.670 --> 00:11:48.250 line:100% position:50% align:middle
because I've already authenticated it. Two
pictures of myself.

00:11:48.250 --> 00:11:52.310 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Authorize application, and then, oh, look
what comes back. So,

00:11:52.310 --> 00:11:58.480 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I just authenticated, which is right here.
We authenticated with GitHub,

00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:03.230 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and then when that successfully worked ,
we ran authHandler, which,

00:12:03.230 --> 00:12:07.910 line:100% position:50% align:middle
let's go to the authHandler function here,
and then let's look in here...error and

00:12:07.910 --> 00:12:12.290 line:100% position:50% align:middle
authData, this is what we're seeing right
here. The console logging the authData,

00:12:12.290 --> 00:12:16.790 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and inside of there you're going to see
information about the actual user.

00:12:16.790 --> 00:12:21.350 line:100% position:50% align:middle
You can see my email address, and any
other good information, as well as some

00:12:21.350 --> 00:12:22.310 line:100% position:50% align:middle
credentials.

00:12:22.310 --> 00:12:26.720 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Good, but what we actually need to do with
this data is then store it in state so

00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:32.740 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that we can re-render the inventory
component and show those boxes to edit.

00:12:32.740 --> 00:12:37.310 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So, we're going to go to our authHandler
function. If there's an error,

00:12:37.310 --> 00:12:44.080 line:100% position:50% align:middle
then we'll "console.errorerr" the actual
error itself and "return." Otherwise,

00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:50.220 line:100% position:50% align:middle
what we're going to do is "// grab the
store info." So, essentially what we need

00:12:50.220 --> 00:12:54.940 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to do is, if they've authenticated here,
we need to grab the reference to our

00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:59.490 line:100% position:50% align:middle
actual store. In this case, "Sparkling
Plain Leaves," and we're going to do a

00:12:59.490 --> 00:13:04.350 line:100% position:50% align:middle
couple things. We're going to claim it as
our own, as well as update our state.

00:13:04.350 --> 00:13:08.190 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So, we're going to connect directly to
Firebase. We're going to grab sort of a

00:13:08.190 --> 00:13:13.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
copy of all the information about the
current store, and then when that info

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:17.140 line:100% position:50% align:middle
comes back from Firebase, we're going to
say, "Okay, we've got all the information

00:13:17.140 --> 00:13:23.730 line:100% position:50% align:middle
about Sparkling Plain Leaves, we've got
this person, Wes, who's signed in.

00:13:23.730 --> 00:13:30.890 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now, first of all, does Wes own this
store? If not, the question is,

00:13:30.890 --> 00:13:34.390 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"Is someone else the owner?" If that's not
true, then, finally,

00:13:34.390 --> 00:13:37.740 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we're going to set them as the actual
owner. Otherwise, we're not going to set

00:13:37.740 --> 00:13:40.640 line:100% position:50% align:middle
them as an owner. So, we've got to grab
the store info and we're going to connect

00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:47.350 line:100% position:50% align:middle
directly to Firebase for this. So we say,
"const storeRef = base.database," and what

00:13:47.350 --> 00:13:50.260 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that's going to do is connect us directly
with our Firebase database,

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:52.950 line:100% position:50% align:middle
which will allow us to use any of the
existing Firebase APIs. So,

00:13:52.950 --> 00:13:58.150 line:100% position:50% align:middle
if you go to any of the Firebase
documentation, you can also use any of the

00:13:58.150 --> 00:14:01.670 line:100% position:50% align:middle
API that you have there if some of the
stuff in Rebase doesn't cut it for you.

00:14:01.670 --> 00:14:05.750 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And then we're going to say, "ref"
because, what a "ref" will do is it will

00:14:05.750 --> 00:14:08.680 line:100% position:50% align:middle
allow us to get just a piece of our
database. We don't want the entire

00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:12.820 line:100% position:50% align:middle
database with every single store that's
ever happened, we just want Sparkling

00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:16.390 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Plain Leaves. So we would normally just
type that in here, like,

00:14:16.390 --> 00:14:20.270 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"'sparkling... '"blah, blah, blah, but we
can't. We need to make it dynamic.

00:14:20.270 --> 00:14:26.310 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we need to pass down the store again.
So we'll go to app, go to the bottom here,

00:14:26.310 --> 00:14:33.430 line:100% position:50% align:middle
go to our inventory, and we'll say,
"storeID=this.props.storeID." Good.

00:14:33.430 --> 00:14:36.600 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Then we will go to inventory.

00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:42.750 line:100% position:50% align:middle
What do you do when you add a new prop?
You go down here and you add it,

00:14:42.750 --> 00:14:48.950 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"storeId" is going to be a string, and
that's required that we pass it.

00:14:48.950 --> 00:14:53.680 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Okay. Oh, we got a bit of an error here.
Required prop storeId was not specified,

00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:57.200 line:100% position:50% align:middle
so, right away, it's catching an error. I
don't know what the error is,

00:14:57.200 --> 00:15:01.040 line:100% position:50% align:middle
but obviously I did something wrong.and
our prop types are kicking in to tell me

00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:05.270 line:100% position:50% align:middle
something went wrong. So, let me take a
quick look at when we passed it.

00:15:05.270 --> 00:15:11.390 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So, we passed the data here and, oh, it's
"this.props.params.storeId." So,

00:15:11.390 --> 00:15:15.860 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that was just a silly mistake that I made
and it caught it immediately.

00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:21.010 line:100% position:50% align:middle
See, there we go. Then we go back to our
inventory, back up to the function we were

00:15:21.010 --> 00:15:30.200 line:100% position:50% align:middle
just writing, "refthis.props.storeId."
Good. Then we want to get the data once,

00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:41.950 line:100% position:50% align:middle
so we'll say, "query the firebase once for
the store data." "storeRef.once'value',"

00:15:41.950 --> 00:15:47.640 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and then that returns to us. I call that a
"snapshot," which with Firebase is sort of

00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:55.200 line:100% position:50% align:middle
object of all the data. And then we can
say, "const data = snapshot.val." You have

00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:58.190 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to call "val" on it to get the actual data
out of it, otherwise,

00:15:58.190 --> 00:16:00.390 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it's going to be a blank object.

00:16:00.390 --> 00:16:08.240 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Then we claim it as our own if there's no
owner already. And the way that we claim

00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:15.130 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it as our own is we simply just set
"storeRef.set" and we are going to set the

00:16:15.130 --> 00:16:19.540 line:100% position:50% align:middle
owner to be...now we go back to this
authData dump that we have,

00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:26.950 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we say "authData.user.uid." And that UID
is going to be unique coming from GitHub.

00:16:26.950 --> 00:16:33.320 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Good. Now let's see how it is here. Let
this refresh. I'm going to open up my

00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:37.270 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Firebase, I'm going to go to the database,
so I'm going to open up Sparkling Plain

00:16:37.270 --> 00:16:46.990 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Leaves. See, we only have "fishes" here
right now, but if I log in with GitHub,

00:16:46.990 --> 00:16:54.130 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I go back, I see my owner now is opened on
up and that user ID is there.

00:16:54.130 --> 00:16:57.080 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Good, but we still can't see any of the
fishes, we can't load them,

00:16:57.080 --> 00:16:58.850 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we can't actually work with any of it
right now.

00:16:58.850 --> 00:17:03.480 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So what we need to do is set the state
locally in our application,

00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:11.392 line:100% position:50% align:middle
as well. So, we'll say, "this.setState,"
say the user ID is going to be the same

00:17:11.392 --> 00:17:20.714 line:100% position:50% align:middle
thing, "authData.user.uid," and then the
"owner:" is going to be either,

00:17:20.714 --> 00:17:27.263 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"data"...what's data? Data is the actual
"store.owner" or it's going to be

00:17:27.263 --> 00:17:36.050 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"authData.user.uid." Good. That was a lot.
It's a little bit confusing having to jump

00:17:36.050 --> 00:17:40.460 line:100% position:50% align:middle
between the two, so maybe take a second to
just read over that a couple times to see

00:17:40.460 --> 00:17:47.040 line:100% position:50% align:middle
if you know what's going on here, but now
I think when I log in with GitHub...aha,

00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:50.910 line:100% position:50% align:middle
look what happens. When I log in with
GitHub, it comes back and now gives me the

00:17:50.910 --> 00:17:55.540 line:100% position:50% align:middle
fish. I can load in a whole bunch of
sample fishes, I can remove those fishes,

00:17:55.540 --> 00:17:57.540 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and be able to update my Firebase.

00:17:57.540 --> 00:18:03.550 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now, there is a problem in that, when I
refresh, I have to log in again.

00:18:03.550 --> 00:18:07.700 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Every single time I refresh, I have to log
in again, and then I'll be able to

00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:12.020 line:100% position:50% align:middle
actually edit it. So, when would we do
that? Well, hopefully, you're thinking

00:18:12.020 --> 00:18:16.650 line:100% position:50% align:middle
back to when we've previously done that
and we can use one of the React lifecycle

00:18:16.650 --> 00:18:20.020 line:100% position:50% align:middle
hooks to hook into it, and the one that
we're going to be using is called,

00:18:20.020 --> 00:18:25.060 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"component did mount." I;m going to go up
to the top here, right underneath

00:18:25.060 --> 00:18:28.130 line:100% position:50% align:middle
constructor, and we're going to use
"componentDidMount." I sort of like to

00:18:28.130 --> 00:18:32.150 line:100% position:50% align:middle
always put all of my lifecycle and
constructor stuff above all of my custom

00:18:32.150 --> 00:18:35.870 line:100% position:50% align:middle
stuff, and then I like to put my render
right at the bottom, but that's just a

00:18:35.870 --> 00:18:40.060 line:100% position:50% align:middle
personal preference. So we say,
"base.onAuth" and that is going to

00:18:40.060 --> 00:18:45.660 line:100% position:50% align:middle
listen...this is sort of like base is our
database, and then onAuth is sort of like

00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:49.730 line:100% position:50% align:middle
if you've done jQuery, you could say,
"on'auth'" or "on'click'," so "onAuth" is

00:18:49.730 --> 00:18:54.010 line:100% position:50% align:middle
going to listen for when we load the page,
Firebase is going to immediately try to

00:18:54.010 --> 00:18:59.500 line:100% position:50% align:middle
authenticate myself again. And, when that
happens, we're going to run this user

00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:10.290 line:100% position:50% align:middle
here, and we are going to check if there's
a user, and then, if there is,

00:19:10.290 --> 00:19:13.990 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we're just going to call
"this.authHandler" again. We're not going

00:19:13.990 --> 00:19:18.960 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to pass anything there, and then we'll
pass the user along with it.

00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:27.140 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So, we're using this authHandler callback
both once for when the actual user gets

00:19:27.140 --> 00:19:31.390 line:100% position:50% align:middle
signed in the first time, and then
subsequently every single time that we

00:19:31.390 --> 00:19:35.340 line:100% position:50% align:middle
reload the page, we're going to call this
authHandler again, and then that should,

00:19:35.340 --> 00:19:39.400 line:100% position:50% align:middle
in turn, do all the checking and the
setting of state and all that hard stuff.

00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:42.930 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And so now I save. Hopefully, when it
refreshes...yes, you see,

00:19:42.930 --> 00:19:45.990 line:100% position:50% align:middle
like, for a split second there, we do see
the log in buttons, and,

00:19:45.990 --> 00:19:51.540 line:100% position:50% align:middle
again, you could use your lifecycle hooks
to prevent that, but as soon as it loads,

00:19:51.540 --> 00:19:57.360 line:100% position:50% align:middle
as soon as it did mount, then it's up and
running. So, that is our authentication on

00:19:57.360 --> 00:20:00.810 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the client side. We just need to hook up
this "LOG OUT" button.

00:20:00.810 --> 00:20:05.350 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So, I'm going to go right underneath our
authenticate, and we're going to make a,

00:20:05.350 --> 00:20:12.800 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"logout" method, that doesn't take any
arguments in, and then inside of that,

00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:16.660 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we do a couple things. First, we need to
just run "base.unauth," it's really easy,

00:20:16.660 --> 00:20:20.710 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it's going to connect, or we already
connected to it, and run unauth.

00:20:20.710 --> 00:20:25.450 line:100% position:50% align:middle
That'll log us out and sever any ties we
have with Firebase. And then we simply say

00:20:25.450 --> 00:20:29.910 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"this.setState" and we are going to set
the user ID of the currently logged in

00:20:29.910 --> 00:20:34.900 line:100% position:50% align:middle
person to be nothing because we need to
delete that as well. Then,

00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:39.780 line:100% position:50% align:middle
of course, we'll do our whole song and
dance where we go to the top here and bind

00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:45.550 line:100% position:50% align:middle
logout, and then we go to our button where
we created the logout button.

00:20:45.550 --> 00:20:53.940 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Here we go. And then "onClick= =>
this.logout." Actually, in this case,

00:20:53.940 --> 00:21:00.170 line:100% position:50% align:middle
because we are not passing any arguments,
we can simply just pass it like this,

00:21:00.170 --> 00:21:05.280 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"this.logout" You only need to do that
song and dance here for when you need to

00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:10.720 line:100% position:50% align:middle
pass an argument, so we'll say,
"this.logout" and when I click it,

00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:15.300 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it will just sign me on out. And then I
can go ahead and sign in again with

00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:17.820 line:100% position:50% align:middle
GitHub, should I want that.

00:21:17.820 --> 00:21:22.160 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now we actually need to head on to the
other side, which is secure things at

00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:27.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Firebase's end because, like, I visually
can't edit these fish,

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:31.360 line:100% position:50% align:middle
but anybody with a little bit of know-how
as to how Firebase works would be able to

00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:37.050 line:100% position:50% align:middle
figure out how to query and edit all the
different fishes if they knew how Firebase

00:21:37.050 --> 00:21:40.700 line:100% position:50% align:middle
works. So, we need to go to Firebase, our
security rules. So, click on Database,

00:21:40.700 --> 00:21:43.640 line:100% position:50% align:middle
go to your database and click on rules,
and way earlier, like,

00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:49.140 line:100% position:50% align:middle
many videos ago, we set "read" and "write"
to be true. Now what we need to do is

00:21:49.140 --> 00:21:52.820 line:100% position:50% align:middle
change those security rules, and I've
provided you a file called

00:21:52.820 --> 00:21:57.520 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"Security-rules. JSON." I'm just going to
paste them in here, and then I'll explain

00:21:57.520 --> 00:22:01.620 line:100% position:50% align:middle
them.for you. So, I'm just going to paste
it in here, and I'm going to go through it

00:22:01.620 --> 00:22:02.924 line:100% position:50% align:middle
with you.
So, the rules.

00:22:02.924 --> 00:22:07.110 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Reading. Anybody can read
it, right? True. Write.

00:22:07.110 --> 00:22:12.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
You can only write to it if the data
doesn't exist. So, this let's people not

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:16.600 line:100% position:50% align:middle
being able to delete an existing room.
Otherwise, you could call Firebase.delete.

00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:21.700 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And then on each individual room, and
that's just like sort of one level down,

00:22:21.700 --> 00:22:26.970 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that's what I did with "$r," only the
store owner can edit the data.

00:22:26.970 --> 00:22:32.220 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So, in order to...anybody can read. Right?
No problem. Anybody can read all of that

00:22:32.220 --> 00:22:37.340 line:100% position:50% align:middle
data, but to write to that individual room
or to write to that individual

00:22:37.340 --> 00:22:42.710 line:100% position:50% align:middle
store...maybe that would be better to be
called...we have to say that when new data

00:22:42.710 --> 00:22:48.240 line:100% position:50% align:middle
comes into Firebase, if the owner is not
equal to the currently authenticated user

00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:52.870 line:100% position:50% align:middle
ID, then don't allow them. So, that's how
Firebase works. You have to set these

00:22:52.870 --> 00:22:58.260 line:100% position:50% align:middle
rules for reading and writing. And, in
this case, we will not let anybody write

00:22:58.260 --> 00:23:05.030 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to it unless the owner...again, I can show
you the owner ID is equal to whatever the

00:23:05.030 --> 00:23:09.690 line:100% position:50% align:middle
owner, the user's ID when they are
actually logged in. And that will lock it

00:23:09.690 --> 00:23:14.050 line:100% position:50% align:middle
down so that no one can monkey around with
it up behind the scenes.

00:23:14.050 --> 00:23:16.910 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So, let's save that, make sure that your
rules are in there...

00:23:16.910 --> 00:23:21.820 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I forgot to save it...and I'm going to
publish them. Good. Then I'm just going to

00:23:21.820 --> 00:23:26.320 line:100% position:50% align:middle
go ahead and refresh this. Good, and I
should still be able to say,

00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:33.080 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"Hey Ho," refresh and it still says "Hey
Ho." I log out, and I'm not able to

00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:34.800 line:100% position:50% align:middle
actually edit it. Good.
