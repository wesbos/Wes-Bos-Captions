- [Wes] Before we dive into any code, I
want to make sure that we're all

00:00:09.302 --> 00:00:12.546 line:100% position:50% align:middle
comfortable with the tools and the files
that we're going to be using. All too

00:00:12.546 --> 00:00:15.873 line:100% position:50% align:middle
often, you pick up a project and they just
sort of dump a GitHub repo full of files

00:00:15.873 --> 00:00:20.353 line:100% position:50% align:middle
in your lap and you really aren't sure
where to start, so let's run through all

00:00:20.353 --> 00:00:24.940 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the things that you need to be up and
running. First of all, we need Node.js,

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:28.980 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and while we're not doing any server-side
programming, all the tooling that you use

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.050 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to work with React is done in Node

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.060 line:100% position:50% align:middle
so head on over to nodejs.org and
download the latest, current version.

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:40.363 line:100% position:50% align:middle
If you don't know if you have Node
installed or not, go to your terminal and

00:00:40.363 --> 00:00:45.540 line:100% position:50% align:middle
just type node -v, and that will tell you
what version of Node you have installed.

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:49.850 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So if it's anything less than six, I would
probably just head on over to Node.js and

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:54.944 line:100% position:50% align:middle
re-download this, go through the installer
and you'll be up and running. We also

00:00:54.944 --> 00:00:59.852 line:100% position:50% align:middle
need React DevTools and this is available
both for Chrome as well as Firefox. And

00:00:59.852 --> 00:01:03.240 line:100% position:50% align:middle
what React DevTools are going to allow us
to do is we're going to be able to look at

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:07.340 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the components and the state and the props
and all of the good stuff that's related

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.910 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to React, and it just adds another
tab to our regular DevTool. So

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:17.540 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that is for sure required on either Chrome
or Firefox, whatever one you're using.

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.528 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Next up, we're going to be writing
something called JSX, as well as we're

00:01:20.528 --> 00:01:24.009 line:100% position:50% align:middle
going to be writing a lot of
javascript as an ES6, which is

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:26.485 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the latest version of JavaScript.

00:01:26.485 --> 00:01:31.540 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So in order to have, like, the best syntax
highlighting both for ES6 as well as for

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:35.160 line:100% position:50% align:middle
JSX, which is sort of like writing
HTML inside your JavaScript,

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:39.810 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we're going to learn all about that in
this course, we need a highlighter for

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.900 line:100% position:50% align:middle
your actual editor. So on Sublime Text,
which is what I'm going to be using in

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:48.830 line:100% position:50% align:middle
this tutorial here, there's one called
Babel, and what that will do is when you

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:53.503 line:100% position:50% align:middle
open up one of your JavaScript files, in
the bottom right-hand corner,

00:01:53.503 --> 00:01:58.965 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it should say JavaScript (Babel). So if
it just says JavaScript after you have

00:01:58.965 --> 00:02:06.220 line:100% position:50% align:middle
gone to the package control, and type
install package, and type install Babel.

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:10.104 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I'll let you figure that out, there's
tutorials on how to install a

00:02:10.104 --> 00:02:13.430 line:100% position:50% align:middle
package in Sublime online.

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:18.290 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Go to JavaScript, in the bottom right-hand
corner make sure you're in a .js file,

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.460 line:100% position:50% align:middle
any file will do. Open all with current
extension, and then just hunt through this

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:27.820 line:100% position:50% align:middle
list for actual Babel, and then you will
be able to see JavaScript (Babel).

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:31.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
It's just off my screen here, but
you can grab it from there and

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.157 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that will just give us all of the syntax
highlighting we need for ES6 as well as

00:02:35.157 --> 00:02:40.140 line:100% position:50% align:middle
JSX. If you're using Atom, just go and
grab the React package for you there.

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:45.860 line:100% position:50% align:middle
If you're using Vim, go and grab vim-jsx,
and pretty much all of the other editors

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:50.597 line:100% position:50% align:middle
out there have some sort of
support for ES6 as well as JSX.

00:02:50.597 --> 00:02:56.170 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Next thing we need is a console or a
terminal window. We're not going to be

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:00.380 line:100% position:50% align:middle
doing a whole lot in the terminal window,
but in order for us to start and stop all

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:06.730 line:100% position:50% align:middle
of our actual webpack processes and deploy
this thing, we're going to be running some

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:08.320 line:100% position:50% align:middle
commands in our terminal.

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:14.110 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So on OS X there is a terminal built in. I
use something called iTerm 2,

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:17.680 line:100% position:50% align:middle
as well as there's another one called
HyperTerm, which is gaining a lot of

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.800 line:100% position:50% align:middle
popularity, you can grab that one. If
you're on Windows, I definitely recommend

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:28.164 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that you go grab this one called cmder,
C-M-D-E-R, and what that will do is it

00:03:28.164 --> 00:03:31.534 line:100% position:50% align:middle
just give you, like, some nice
highlighting here, and it's already set up

00:03:31.534 --> 00:03:34.030 line:100% position:50% align:middle
for a lot of the stuff that
we're going to be doing.

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:37.690 line:100% position:50% align:middle
You can use the default windows terminal
if you know what you're doing there,

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:41.160 line:100% position:50% align:middle
but if you want some nicer highlighting,
go and grab cmder, so

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:45.830 line:100% position:50% align:middle
those are all the tools that we need to
have everything up and running.

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:48.120 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Let's jump into learning some code.

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.750 line:100% position:50% align:middle
If you log into your account on
reactforbeginners.com/account,

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:56.210 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you're going to see access to your actual
course here. What I want you to do is hop

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:59.240 line:100% position:50% align:middle
on over to the starter files
button that we see here

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:01.332 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and download these starter files.

00:04:01.332 --> 00:04:04.450 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now, when you open that up, you're going
to see two folders. There's one called

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:08.550 line:100% position:50% align:middle
catch-of-the-day, and that's where we're
going to be working out of for the entire

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:11.380 line:100% position:50% align:middle
course. And then there's another
folder called stepped-solutions,

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:15.522 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that's going to contain all of the
stepped code that we write throughout the

00:04:15.522 --> 00:04:19.850 line:100% position:50% align:middle
videos. Not every video is going to have
code that is significant enough that we're

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:23.928 line:100% position:50% align:middle
going to put it in there, but sometimes if
you get, maybe on video six or something,

00:04:23.928 --> 00:04:27.230 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you get a little sidetracked and
you're not sure what went on.

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:30.470 line:100% position:50% align:middle
You want to get back up to speed with
where the videos are, you can go into

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:33.671 line:100% position:50% align:middle
stepped-solution, grab that code, and
bring it back into your catch-of-the-day

00:04:33.671 --> 00:04:36.487 line:100% position:50% align:middle
folder. So again, we're
only ever going to

00:04:36.487 --> 00:04:39.219 line:100% position:50% align:middle
be working out of
the catch-of-the-day folder.

00:04:39.219 --> 00:04:44.119 line:100% position:50% align:middle
What we need to do is go to this folder in
our terminal. Now if you aren't really

00:04:44.119 --> 00:04:48.074 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that comfortable moving around in the
terminal, one little trick you can do is

00:04:48.074 --> 00:04:52.768 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you type cd space, and just drag
and drop the folder into your terminal.

00:04:52.768 --> 00:04:57.500 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And what that's going to do is it's
going to complete the actual path for that

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:02.370 line:100% position:50% align:middle
folder, and then you should be in the
catch-of-the-day folder here.

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:07.050 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now in order to actually use React,
because we're going to be using React,

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:09.960 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we're going to be using a couple other
modules in here, we're going to be

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:14.057 line:100% position:50% align:middle
bundling all of our code, we need
something that's called a module bundler.

00:05:14.057 --> 00:05:19.605 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And what that will do is, rather
than us go into our HTML file...

00:05:19.605 --> 00:05:23.025 line:100% position:50% align:middle
- [Man] Folks, quick interruption! In this
video tutorial, you'll mostly see me

00:05:23.025 --> 00:05:26.820 line:100% position:50% align:middle
referencing index.html right
inside of the catch-of-the-day.

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:31.514 line:100% position:50% align:middle
However, Create React App and React
Scripts, they have moved that to a public

00:05:31.514 --> 00:05:35.980 line:100% position:50% align:middle
folder, which you could also put images
and any other CSS that you'd like to have

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:40.717 line:100% position:50% align:middle
public so it doesn't matter, because
we're not editing index.html at all,

00:05:40.717 --> 00:05:44.173 line:100% position:50% align:middle
however, if you're just wondering, like,
"where's index.html? It's in the sidebar

00:05:44.173 --> 00:05:47.758 line:100% position:50% align:middle
for him, but not for me!" It's
because it's in your public folder.

00:05:47.758 --> 00:05:49.470 line:100% position:50% align:middle
That's it, continue on.

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:58.346 line:100% position:50% align:middle
- ...and go into our script tag here, and
say script, source equals react.js,

00:05:58.346 --> 00:06:00.906 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and then like react-dom.js.

00:06:00.906 --> 00:06:04.310 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And you know how you would do this with
jQuery and all of your plugins?

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:08.360 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Rather than popping in a new script tag
every time that we need a dependency,

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:13.080 line:100% position:50% align:middle
what we're going to be doing is we're
writing all of our code in this index.js

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:16.433 line:100% position:50% align:middle
as well as in all the components that were
going to be created. And we're going to

00:06:16.433 --> 00:06:20.829 line:100% position:50% align:middle
import all of the libraries as we will
need it, so we'll import React,

00:06:20.829 --> 00:06:24.138 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we're going to import
react-dom and any of the

00:06:24.138 --> 00:06:26.187 line:100% position:50% align:middle
other modules that we actually need.

00:06:26.187 --> 00:06:30.497 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now, in order to actually work with this,
we need something called a module bundler,

00:06:30.497 --> 00:06:33.655 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and that's going to take all of our
JavaScript files and deal with the imports

00:06:33.655 --> 00:06:38.630 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and the exports, and just pack it into
this one, nice and tidy JavaScript file.

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:42.556 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And in order to do that, we need a
bundler, and the most popular one with

00:06:42.556 --> 00:06:47.410 line:100% position:50% align:middle
working with React is called Webpack. Now
there are other ES module bundlers out

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:51.300 line:100% position:50% align:middle
there, there's Browserify, and SystemJS,
and Rollup, and you're welcome to use

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:55.130 line:100% position:50% align:middle
other ones if that's what you prefer, but
it seems to be that the React community

00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:59.142 line:100% position:50% align:middle
has sort of settled on using Webpack to
bundle all of their JavaScript.

00:06:59.142 --> 00:07:03.651 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And behind the scenes, we are going to be
using something called Create React App,

00:07:03.651 --> 00:07:08.640 line:100% position:50% align:middle
so Facebook actually released this just a
couple months ago and it really simplifies

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:12.290 line:100% position:50% align:middle
all of the tooling that you need to get up
and running. If you've ever tried to

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:16.030 line:100% position:50% align:middle
create your own Webpack file, you
know that it's just not possible.

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:20.330 line:100% position:50% align:middle
It's a really tough thing to deal with
and it just gets in the way.

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:23.430 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Like, we just want to learn React here, we
don't want to have to deal with,

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:28.210 line:100% position:50% align:middle
like, files and files of configuration,
and setup, and Babel and all of that good

00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:32.179 line:100% position:50% align:middle
stuff. So what we use behind the
scenes is called Create React App,

00:07:32.179 --> 00:07:36.793 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and that uses Webpack behind
the scenes for us. In a later video,

00:07:36.793 --> 00:07:39.850 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I'm going to show you how you
can eject from Create React App,

00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:44.886 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and then you can get access to all the
nitty-gritty details of your Webpack

00:07:44.886 --> 00:07:49.212 line:100% position:50% align:middle
setup. So, in order to get up
and running with that, we've got a

00:07:49.212 --> 00:07:53.760 line:100% position:50% align:middle
package.json here, and this just contains
all of the stuff that we need to actually

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:57.814 line:100% position:50% align:middle
build our application right here. We've
got history, and React Router,

00:07:57.814 --> 00:07:59.879 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and react-dom and all that good stuff

00:07:59.879 --> 00:08:04.030 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and then we've also got a couple dev
dependencies here, one of them being

00:08:04.030 --> 00:08:07.860 line:100% position:50% align:middle
react-scripts, which is what
Create React App uses for us. So

00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:12.474 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we want to go to our iTerm here, and we
are in the catch-of-the-day folder, and

00:08:12.474 --> 00:08:18.410 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we simply type npm install. And this is
going to read all of the dependencies that

00:08:18.410 --> 00:08:22.680 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we need from dev dependencies and our
dependencies here. It's going to go off,

00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:25.497 line:100% position:50% align:middle
fetch them and install them to
us, so I'm just going to pause it

00:08:25.497 --> 00:08:27.502 line:100% position:50% align:middle
here a sec while we
do that so after,

00:08:27.502 --> 00:08:30.020 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I don't know, a minute or so
it installed all that stuff.

00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:34.460 line:100% position:50% align:middle
A whole bunch of stuff streamed across the
screen. One thing that people ask me all

00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:37.400 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the time, is they open up their node
modules, and they go "Holy shit,

00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:41.540 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Wes, what's going on?" These are all the
dependencies that you need,

00:08:41.540 --> 00:08:44.280 line:100% position:50% align:middle
as well as your dependencies need, and
their dependencies and their

00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:48.846 line:100% position:50% align:middle
dependencies. Don't worry about
it, it's not anything not normal.

00:08:48.846 --> 00:08:53.170 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I know it seems like a lot of stuff going
on here, but that's just how the front-end

00:08:53.170 --> 00:08:56.499 line:100% position:50% align:middle
ecosystem works right now so if
you see a lot of stuff in here,

00:08:56.499 --> 00:08:58.632 line:100% position:50% align:middle
don't worry about it. Just close
up your Node modules.

00:08:58.632 --> 00:09:01.534 line:100% position:50% align:middle
You're never going to have to edit
anything actually inside of

00:09:01.534 --> 00:09:03.071 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that Node modules folder.

00:09:03.071 --> 00:09:08.180 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now that we've installed it, we can go
ahead and actually start our Create React

00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:11.970 line:100% position:50% align:middle
App. And what that's going to do is that's
going to bundle our JavaScript for us,

00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:17.920 line:100% position:50% align:middle
as well as fire up a little server for us,
where any time we make a change to our

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:22.170 line:100% position:50% align:middle
JavaScript or any time we make a change
to our CSS, it's going to automatically

00:09:22.170 --> 00:09:26.523 line:100% position:50% align:middle
reload that for us. So the way that we
run that, and if you look at your

00:09:26.523 --> 00:09:29.809 line:100% position:50% align:middle
package.json, we've got
a couple scripts here. And

00:09:29.809 --> 00:09:34.580 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the one that we're really just going
to be working with is npm start

00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:38.380 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and that's going to run this start
command for us as well. However,

00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:42.680 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I've got some other ones called watch,
which is going to run our start command as

00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:46.570 line:100% position:50% align:middle
well as watch our styles. When we
get into the animation video,

00:09:46.570 --> 00:09:49.300 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we're going to learn about how
do we actually watch our styles,

00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:54.293 line:100% position:50% align:middle
as well as watch our JavaScript from
re-running. And then there's build and

00:09:54.293 --> 00:09:58.270 line:100% position:50% align:middle
eject, which are going to
go in later videos as well

00:09:58.270 --> 00:10:02.026 line:100% position:50% align:middle
so, how do we run that? We
simply just run npm start,

00:10:02.026 --> 00:10:07.420 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and that's going to kick off, and look, it
just opens up a brand new blank window for

00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:11.880 line:100% position:50% align:middle
me, but you're not going to see
anything on this actual page here,

00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:16.430 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and that's because we haven't written any
React yet. But we know that this

00:10:16.430 --> 00:10:20.870 line:100% position:50% align:middle
localhost:3000, that is where it is
actually running, and anytime we make a

00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:25.991 line:100% position:50% align:middle
save to this file... If I go to my
index.js, and I just say alert

00:10:25.991 --> 00:10:29.533 line:100% position:50% align:middle
(yeah!) let's get going, give it
a save. You'll see that

00:10:29.533 --> 00:10:32.009 line:100% position:50% align:middle
localhost:3000... I didn't even refresh.

00:10:32.009 --> 00:10:37.215 line:100% position:50% align:middle
It just automatically refreshed it for me,
and that JavaSript was up and running

00:10:37.215 --> 00:10:40.842 line:100% position:50% align:middle
so let's go on to the next video,
where we actually learn how

00:10:40.842 --> 00:10:42.600 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to start writing some React.
