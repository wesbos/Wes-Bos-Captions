If you've ever worked on other
applications before, you may have heard

00:00:09.775 --> 00:00:13.845 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the term, or know the term CRUD.
Now, what CRUD means is Create, Read,

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:18.150 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Update, and Delete. Now, we've done
create, which is we can create a new fish

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:24.540 line:100% position:50% align:middle
in this box here. We can read them into
our state right here. We can update them,

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:25.520 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that's what we did here.

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:29.650 line:100% position:50% align:middle
But really, the last piece is that
deleting. How do you actually remove one

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:33.310 line:100% position:50% align:middle
of these items from our state?
We don't have a way to do that.

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:38.833 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So let's go to our App.js. And you know
how we have addFish and updateFish.

00:00:38.833 --> 00:00:45.375 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We just need to create a third one called
removeFish. And that will take in a key,

00:00:45.375 --> 00:00:51.986 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and it works the same way up to this,
but we want to delete the actual item

00:00:51.986 --> 00:00:54.130 line:100% position:50% align:middle
instead of setting it to something.

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:56.884 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we need to first take a
copy of our fishes,

00:00:56.884 --> 00:01:03.251 line:100% position:50% align:middle
const fishes = ... ourselves
...this.state.fishes

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:07.670 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Again, we used 'this.' Hopefully,
that triggers you. We've got to go up to

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:15.523 line:100% position:50% align:middle
our constructor. I'm going to add
removeFish. Good. Back to removeFish.

00:01:15.523 --> 00:01:19.710 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now, I've got a copy of state.
Then we want to remove it. Now,

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.248 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you might think, okay, we run
delete fishes [key];

00:01:24.248 --> 00:01:27.136 line:100% position:50% align:middle
however because we are
hooked up to firebase,

00:01:27.136 --> 00:01:31.485 line:100% position:50% align:middle
there's some weirdness around that.
Instead of running delete directly,

00:01:31.485 --> 00:01:35.994 line:100% position:50% align:middle
which apparently doesn't work with
firebase, you need to explicitly set it to

00:01:35.994 --> 00:01:40.167 line:100% position:50% align:middle
null. And then we need to update state.

00:01:40.167 --> 00:01:44.075 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So this.setState and
we simply pass it, fishes.

00:01:44.838 --> 00:01:50.760 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Good. Now, we should be able to delete
a fish. So we've got this Lovely Pacific

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:55.718 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Halibut, which is fish1. Let's try and
go and delete it. We're going to open

00:01:55.718 --> 00:02:02.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
our React devtools here. We are going to
find our App component. There we go.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:11.143 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And we can run $r. removeFish, and we're
trying to remove fish-1. Didn't work.

00:02:11.143 --> 00:02:12.842 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Let's see what happened.

00:02:12.842 --> 00:02:18.086 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Go back to our React devtools.
Open up our... oh, it's not fish-1,

00:02:18.086 --> 00:02:24.574 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it's just fish1. That's why. There we go.
Deleted fish1. There was a key there.

00:02:24.574 --> 00:02:28.438 line:100% position:50% align:middle
It found it. It deleted it. You see our
inventory, as well as our lobster,

00:02:28.438 --> 00:02:32.550 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and the fact that it was in our order, and
now it's gone. All of those things have

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:38.610 line:100% position:50% align:middle
updated where we just touch state once.
Good, but we actually want that to run on

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:44.810 line:100% position:50% align:middle
click. Again, we take that removeFish,
we are going to pass it to our inventory,

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:50.305 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and call it removeFish. Then I'm going to
open up our inventory component here.

00:02:50.305 --> 00:02:56.610 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We're going to go into our div class of
fish-edit, and we'll put a button at the

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:01.154 line:100% position:50% align:middle
bottom here. Inside of it, we'll say
Remove Fish, and we'll add an onClick

00:03:01.154 --> 00:03:08.853 line:100% position:50% align:middle
handler to that, will simply will run
this.props.removeFish and you pass it.

00:03:08.853 --> 00:03:13.763 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We have this key value here, so we
can pass it to key here. That should work.

00:03:15.854 --> 00:03:22.207 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Remove fish, bomb, done. Bam, bam,
bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.

00:03:22.207 --> 00:03:25.170 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Oh, they're all gone. We can load in some
more sample ones, and then continue to

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:30.888 line:100% position:50% align:middle
remove it. So again, we just created
a new method called removeFish,

00:03:30.888 --> 00:03:35.108 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we passed it down to our inventory
and called that onClick. Now,

00:03:35.108 --> 00:03:38.560 line:100% position:50% align:middle
how do we actually update our order as
well, because if I add something to my

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.621 line:100% position:50% align:middle
order here, I want to be able to delete
it? So let's look at how we do that.

00:03:43.386 --> 00:03:48.220 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Removing from order is almost exactly the
same way, and maybe I'll challenge you.

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:52.522 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Just maybe pause this video and see
if you can write the method in App.js

00:03:52.522 --> 00:03:56.660 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to remove from order and then hook up a
button in your inventory so that when you

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:00.813 line:100% position:50% align:middle
click it, it's going to remove it from
your order. So maybe if you're feeling

00:04:00.813 --> 00:04:04.070 line:100% position:50% align:middle
comfortable with this right now, pause it,
try it, and then come back and see how

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:08.830 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we did it. Otherwise, come along for the
ride with me. So we are going to find our

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:15.890 line:100% position:50% align:middle
addToOrder method and right below that we
are going to add a removeFromOrder method

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:21.212 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and then inside of that, it is going to
take a key. Which one should we remove?

00:04:21.212 --> 00:04:24.867 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Let's say const order =
we'll take a copy of the state

00:04:24.867 --> 00:04:30.638 line:100% position:50% align:middle
this.state.order, and then we will
delete the actual one from our order.

00:04:30.638 --> 00:04:34.694 line:100% position:50% align:middle
In this case, we can use delete because
we're not limited by firebase.

00:04:34.694 --> 00:04:43.692 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We'll just say delete order[key]; and
then we will say this.setState({ order )}

00:04:43.692 --> 00:04:48.037 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And again, we use 'this,' so we
have to go to the constructor here.

00:04:48.037 --> 00:04:54.857 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And well, I like to keep them together.
addToOrder and removeFromOrder.

00:04:54.857 --> 00:05:00.766 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Good. Now, let's try it manually
ourselves. Open up React devtools.

00:05:00.766 --> 00:05:09.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So I'm just going to go to an entirely new
store called wes. We're going to load

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.534 line:100% position:50% align:middle
in some sample fishes here.
I'm going to add fish1 to my order.

00:05:12.534 --> 00:05:15.830 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I'm going to add fish2 to my order,
maybe a couple of times. Now,

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:20.910 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I'll go to React devtools and find our
App component, and then we'll try

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:28.891 line:100% position:50% align:middle
manually call it.
So $r.removeFromOrder('fish1')

00:05:30.131 --> 00:05:35.236 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Beautiful. You see how it just immediately
did that? And if we check our application

00:05:35.236 --> 00:05:40.730 line:100% position:50% align:middle
state, you should see that it's no longer
actually in our state. So again,

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:47.772 line:100% position:50% align:middle
if I add it back, fish1 is right there.
If I go to console and rerun it,

00:05:49.327 --> 00:05:54.280 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it's deleted. Good. Now, let's hook it up
to a button. Same song and dance.

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:58.213 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Take the remove from order.
We're going to go to our order thing here

00:05:58.213 --> 00:06:03.261 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and we're going to say
removeFromOrder=this.removeFromOrder

00:06:03.261 --> 00:06:06.781 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Then we'll go into our
inventory component here.

00:06:06.781 --> 00:06:11.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Oh, not our inventory. Our order
component. And we will find where we

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.206 line:100% position:50% align:middle
actually render out that order, and that
is right here. It's in renderOrder,

00:06:15.206 --> 00:06:22.065 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and we're going to make a button that we
can put where ever we want because we need

00:06:22.065 --> 00:06:26.390 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to have the Remove From Order
button right here, after Sorry,

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:30.921 line:100% position:50% align:middle
this fish is no longer available. And we
need to have that Remove From Order button

00:06:30.921 --> 00:06:34.326 line:100% position:50% align:middle
right here, after someone actually
did add it to their order.

00:06:34.326 --> 00:06:38.481 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we'll make a remove button,
const removeButton

00:06:38.481 --> 00:06:41.127 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And this is just going to be JSX.
We haven't done this yet,

00:06:41.127 --> 00:06:43.230 line:100% position:50% align:middle
but you can store JSX in a variable,

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:47.330 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and then use that variable later, wherever
you wish. And then I'm just going to put

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:55.092 line:100% position:50% align:middle
&amp;times; in it, that's just an X. And the
button we'll say onClick= run this.

00:06:55.092 --> 00:07:02.177 line:100% position:50% align:middle
this.props.removeFromOrder
and we pass it the key, right?

00:07:02.177 --> 00:07:06.094 line:100% position:50% align:middle
because we have this key value
available to us. Pass it in there.

00:07:06.094 --> 00:07:12.590 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Good. Then we have this removeButton,
I'm going to put it beside my no longer

00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:19.127 line:100% position:50% align:middle
available, and then I'm also going to
put it beside this fish count here.

00:07:22.063 --> 00:07:25.506 line:100% position:50% align:middle
There we've got six pounds of
lobster. I can add it to my order.

00:07:25.506 --> 00:07:28.186 line:100% position:50% align:middle
You see we've got this X button.
When I click it, does it work?

00:07:28.652 --> 00:07:33.538 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Beautiful. It works nicely, and it's just
updating our actual order state.

00:07:33.538 --> 00:07:36.130 line:100% position:50% align:middle
In a coming video, we're going to learn
about how we can animate those on

00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:40.779 line:100% position:50% align:middle
in with React at CSS Animations,
but for now, that's working really nicely.

00:07:40.779 --> 00:07:46.740 line:100% position:50% align:middle
What if we take lobster, and make it Sold
Out? Now we see it no longer available,

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:50.367 line:100% position:50% align:middle
but the X is still there, and I can
still actually remove it from my item.
