<v ->CSS in React can be approached</v>

3
00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:11.700
in a number of different ways so let's take a look

4
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.610
at some of the different options that we have.

5
00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:15.210
So first of all, you might already have

6
00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.430
an existing website which you're integrating React into,

7
00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:20.550
and if that's the case, you likely already have

8
00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.750
an existing build process and an existing CSS

9
00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:25.460
way that you like to write your CSS.

10
00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:27.180
So, if that was the case,

11
00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.370
then you would just open up your indexed HTML

12
00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:32.490
or whatever application has this mounting point

13
00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:33.690
that we talked about earlier,

14
00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.430
and you just stick a link tag in there

15
00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.120
and you have style.css, then the CSS in that CSS file

16
00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.390
is going to be applied to any classes and tags

17
00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:43.760
that get rendered out to the page.

18
00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.240
Another option, and this is often called Componentized CSS

19
00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:51.510
or Inline-CSS, and the idea behind this is

20
00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.390
rather than writing a big CSS file or maybe writing

21
00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.040
multiple SAZ files that compile into one,

22
00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.800
well, what people will do is they will import the CSS

23
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.750
directly into a component

24
00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.770
that only relates with that component.

25
00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:08.370
So, maybe I've got some CSS

26
00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:11.460
that applies to my store selector and styles in h2,

27
00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.460
and styles the button and the input,

28
00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:16.100
then I would just simply import it into this component

29
00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.980
and that will sort of tightly couple the CSS

30
00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:21.820
with the actual component that gets rendered out.

31
00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.090
So, those are sort of the two options,

32
00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.400
there's lots of opinions on either side

33
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.650
as to which way people like

34
00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.460
and I'm not going to really step in there because

35
00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:32.870
it's a bit more of an advanced topic

36
00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:35.100
and I will be covering that in my advanced React.

37
00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.310
So I'm gonna show you how to

38
00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.000
import CSS directly into our index.js file

39
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.970
which is going to get applied to the entire application.

40
00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:46.000
Then, in a future video, I'm gonna show you how to

41
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.750
compile some CSS, so if you are looking to use

42
00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.550
something like SAZ or stylus

43
00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:52.210
and you wanna apply it to this application,

44
00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:53.220
we're gonna look at how we do it

45
00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.660
and that's gonna happen in the animation video.

46
00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:57.500
So, all we really need to do here is,

47
00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.800
I have a style.CSS file for you

48
00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:00.930
and it's already compiled,

49
00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.100
again we're gonna come back to compiling that

50
00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.980
in a future video, you simply just need to

51
00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:09.420
import and then we need to go into the current folder

52
00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.020
and then there's a CSS folder and inside of that

53
00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.500
we have a style.css file and because we are

54
00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.290
set up on create react app, and again,

55
00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.670
create react app under the hood

56
00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.940
will do all the web-pack config for us,

57
00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.640
the webpack config is smart enough to know that

58
00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.310
this is obviously not a Javascript file,

59
00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:29.900
so what it's going to do is it's going to

60
00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.210
load in the CSS, stick it into a style tag,

61
00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:36.110
and then anytime we make any changes to this CSS,

62
00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:38.310
it's gonna automatically do that hot reloading thing

63
00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.080
or it will change it for us.

64
00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.790
Now, when we compile it for production and all that,

65
00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:47.700
then we are going to kick out a separate .css file

66
00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.020
and we'll look at that much later in this course

67
00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.853
of when we have it.

68
00:02:51.853 --> 00:02:54.480
So that's pretty much it, we just import the CSS,

69
00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:55.880
then it gets applied and you can see

70
00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.370
that this stuff is starting to look a lot better.
