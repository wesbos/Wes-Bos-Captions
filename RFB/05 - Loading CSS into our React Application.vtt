CSS in React can be done a number of
different ways and you may have heard some

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:16.820 line:100% position:50% align:middle
people do inline style, some people do a
separate CSS file for every single

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:20.170 line:100% position:50% align:middle
component, and some people just do the
regular old way, where they have a Sass

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:25.360 line:100% position:50% align:middle
file or a CSS file and then they load it
into their HTML. So, whatever works.

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:29.330 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Chances are, if you have an existing
website, you already have CSS already set

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:32.910 line:100% position:50% align:middle
up. So, you don't need to involve that in
your whole Webpack build,

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.560 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you probably already have a process for
that. And there's no problem in just

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:41.660 line:100% position:50% align:middle
having a link tag and saying style.css in
your index.html and everything will be

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:45.475 line:100% position:50% align:middle
rendered on out. However, there are a
couple other ways. If I go to my

00:00:45.475 --> 00:00:52.683 line:100% position:50% align:middle
index.html, one of the things that we can
do is load in our CSS and let Webpack do

00:00:52.683 --> 00:00:56.650 line:100% position:50% align:middle
all of the loading for us, and the hot
reloading and all of that good stuff.

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:03.410 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So, I have compiled a style.css file for
you. Never mind all these style files,

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:06.600 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we're going to go over there when we hit
the animation videos.

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.060 line:100% position:50% align:middle
But, I've compiled a style.css file for
you and what we can then do is,

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.520 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we simply just type import and we don't
need to name it like styles,

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:23.264 line:100% position:50% align:middle
because we're not going to be using it.
We simply just say "import './css/style.css';"

00:01:23.264 --> 00:01:26.460 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and that's going to take
everything that's inside of this file,

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:32.140 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Webpack is going to compile it all and
it's going to pop a style tag on the page

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:36.310 line:100% position:50% align:middle
for us. So now, when I save that, refresh,
automatically things are starting to look

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:41.520 line:100% position:50% align:middle
a lot better. All of that CSS is starting
to kick in. Some other people will have

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.320 line:100% position:50% align:middle
separate .css files for every single
component that they work on.

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.520 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And what that allows them to do is really
just scope the CSS to that specific

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:56.880 line:100% position:50% align:middle
component without having to load into
other pages. So, you could do that if you

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.060 line:100% position:50% align:middle
want. That's really a bit more of an
advanced topic. So, as far as we're

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:06.120 line:100% position:50% align:middle
concerned right now, we just want to
import CSS from the style.css file.

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:09.980 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And then, in a future video, we're going
to look at how do we actually run an NPM

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:15.320 line:100% position:50% align:middle
script in order to compile the style or
fuse Sass or Less or anything like that.

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
How do you compile that on in?
