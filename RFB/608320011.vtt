00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:10.330 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we have our state syncing to
our Firebase, and that's great for when we

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:13.970 line:100% position:50% align:middle
refresh. The data is still going to be
there. However, when I add stuff to my

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:19.760 line:100% position:50% align:middle
order and I refresh, all that data is then
lost. And, rather than sync that to

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:23.530 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Firebase, I want to show you to sync that
to HTML5 local storage.

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:27.520 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And essentially what that means is we're
going to be storing the data pertaining to

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:30.350 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the user's order in the actual browser.

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:34.390 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now, you could use cookies for that but
local storage is a much better fit.

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:39.780 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now, we are going to head back to these
React component life cycle methods.

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.630 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And we need to hook into two more of our
life cycle methods. First of all,

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:50.110 line:100% position:50% align:middle
what we need to do is we need to hook
into when the data actually changes.

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:55.750 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And rather than going into every single
piece where we may update our order state,

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.143 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we can hook into one of the life cycle
methods that's called

00:00:59.143 --> 00:01:01.210 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"componentWillUpdate."

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:04.450 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Let's take a look at it right here. Here
we go. "Updating." componentWillUpdate.

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:09.260 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Invoked immediately before rendering when
new props or state is being received.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.740 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So what that means is that this hook here,
componentWillUpdate.,

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:19.070 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it runs whenever props or state changes.
And that's perfect, because our order is

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:22.350 line:100% position:50% align:middle
state, and that is going to be changed and
passed down via props.

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.180 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So, we're going to hook into the
componentWillUpdate, and I want to show

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:26.940 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you how this works.

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:31.384 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Let's go up to right underneath our
componentWillMount and we'll use

00:01:31.384 --> 00:01:35.230 line:100% position:50% align:middle
componentWillUpdate. And that thing will
pass you in two things.

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:40.870 line:100% position:50% align:middle
It will pass you in the next props and the
next state, so that's like the updated

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:45.070 line:100% position:50% align:middle
props and the updated state. And if
I were to just console log,

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:51.700 line:100% position:50% align:middle
something changed, and I'll take these two
props and state and I'll console log them

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:56.950 line:100% position:50% align:middle
both as well. By the way, that's a little
trick you can do, next props the next day

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.150 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I'll show you what that does here.

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:05.410 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we are going to add something to our
order, and now when we see something

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:09.460 line:100% position:50% align:middle
changed, open that up, there is our next
props, that's what that little trick does.

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:14.720 line:100% position:50% align:middle
If you pass in a curly bracket object,
it's going to name them.

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.380 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So you actually know what these variables
are called. So next props is showing us

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:23.070 line:100% position:50% align:middle
all of our props, and next state is
showing us all of our state.

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:27.960 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So that's good, we need to know that, and
any time that our state will change,

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:31.160 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it's going to run this
componentWillUpdate hook.

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.270 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So inside of that what we need to do is
set our local storage.

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:39.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now if you're never worked with local
storage before, you can access it by going

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.720 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to your application tab here, and you go
to local storage and then click on the

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:47.910 line:100% position:50% align:middle
actual domain name here. Now you might
have some other stuff in here depending on

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:52.130 line:100% position:50% align:middle
if you've ever run any other applications
on your localhost domain.

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:56.570 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And your local storage is going to be tied
directly to your localhost domain.

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:00.610 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now, there is some Firebase stuff in here,
you don't have to really worry about that,

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:07.320 line:100% position:50% align:middle
but local storage is a key value pair.
Meaning that you can set a key here,

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:12.580 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and a value...it's like an object, except
the only difference is that you cannot

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:19.280 line:100% position:50% align:middle
nest an object inside of it. You can only
store numbers and strings and booleans and

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:20.730 line:100% position:50% align:middle
things like that in the value part.

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:25.170 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So the way that local storage works, if
you've never used it...and if you're

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:27.790 line:100% position:50% align:middle
familiar with it you can skip ahead a
couple of minutes...we'll have local

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:32.930 line:100% position:50% align:middle
storage and you say .setitem. And I'm
going to say "Wes," and I'm going to set

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:40.408 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that as, "is really cool." Now I jump back
to my application tab, and there we go,

00:03:40.408 --> 00:03:46.507 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"Wes is really cool." And then I can call
it localstorage.getItem("Wes"),

00:03:46.507 --> 00:03:48.920 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and it will return to me
that actual value.

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:52.360 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So what we're going to do is that whenever
the order state is updated,

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:55.170 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we're going to store it, we're going to
set item in local storage,

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:58.760 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and then when someone refreshes the page,
when they're loading it for the first

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:02.890 line:100% position:50% align:middle
time, we're going to check if there's
anything in local storage and if there is,

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:07.640 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we're going to restore our state via one
of these life cycle hooks.

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:13.390 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we're going to go in here and we're
going to say localstorage.setItem,

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:18.630 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and I'm going to save it as order dash and
then the name of the actual store,

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:24.859 line:100% position:50% align:middle
so Drab Drab Tomatoes, right? But we
can't, again, we can't hard code that,

00:04:24.859 --> 00:04:29.302 line:100% position:50% align:middle
but we can use props, because props gets
passed down. So we'll say

00:04:29.302 --> 00:04:37.160 line:100% position:50% align:middle
this.props.params.storeID. And again,
that's available to us if we go to our

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:44.070 line:100% position:50% align:middle
React dev tools here. And we'll go to
"App," open that up, you see it's in our

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:47.970 line:100% position:50% align:middle
app.params' available here,
if we open up our order here it's actually

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:53.360 line:100% position:50% align:middle
not available to us. So if it's available
at app level but not available at order

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:59.200 line:100% position:50% align:middle
level, how do we pass down all the params?
Well, we can go to our app and

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:03.830 line:100% position:50% align:middle
figure out where we create our order which
is right here. So we passed in fishes,

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:08.140 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and if this is getting a big long you
can put them on their own lines.

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:11.140 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And we can either pass down all of the
params or just the one.

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:15.578 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So I'm going to pass them all down, and
I'm going to say this.props.params.

00:05:15.578 --> 00:05:19.970 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now when that refreshes, we'll go
to our order component.

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:25.620 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And look, params are now available to us
at order level, and we have the storeID.

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:31.281 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we can go back to where we set our
local storage, this.props.params.storeID.

00:05:31.281 --> 00:05:33.820 line:100% position:50% align:middle
so we're going to set,
that's going to be the key,

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:42.330 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and then the actual value is going to be
our next state.order.

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:45.120 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Right? Because next state is the entire
state, and we don't want to put everything

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:49.220 line:100% position:50% align:middle
in there, just the order state inside of
that. Now, that's not going to work and

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:53.450 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I'm going to show you exactly why, so
let's go ahead and run that.

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:57.930 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And I'm going to go to my application tab,
and I'm going to go to my local storage

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:03.670 line:100% position:50% align:middle
here, and as I enter the order, you see
it right here. It's object object.

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:09.980 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And why is that? The reason is, because
you cannot store an object inside of local

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:16.010 line:100% position:50% align:middle
storage, you can only store strings. So
it's actually just turning the object into

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:20.050 line:100% position:50% align:middle
a string, and that's what you get with
object object. So how would you turn an

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:24.550 line:100% position:50% align:middle
object into string? Well you can turn it
into JSON. So we'll just wrap that entire

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:32.900 line:100% position:50% align:middle
thing is a json.stringify, and then we
will start adding things to our order.

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:36.380 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And you should see... hey, there we go,
fish one, and then when I update it, you

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:41.130 line:100% position:50% align:middle
see local storage is getting updated,
add to order, add a couple more.

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:45.550 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And it's just storing the exact
representation of our order state in local

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:51.100 line:100% position:50% align:middle
storage. So that's one way, but now when I
refresh, it's still there.

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:54.720 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Drab Drab Tomato, it actually gets
overwritten because that will run on page

00:06:54.720 --> 00:07:01.460 line:100% position:50% align:middle
load, but we have a problem here where it
doesn't actually reinstate our order.

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:05.610 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And we need to go back up to this
component, willMount life cycle hook,

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:10.856 line:100% position:50% align:middle
so again right before... maybe we put a
comment in here. This runs right before

00:07:10.856 --> 00:07:16.250 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the app is rendered. And we already used
that to hook into our Firebase,

00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:23.270 line:100% position:50% align:middle
but we can also check if there is any
order in local storage. So I'm going to

00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:29.760 line:100% position:50% align:middle
make a reference to that local storage,
equals, and then we're going to try to

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:36.443 line:100% position:50% align:middle
get that item. So say,
localstorage.getItem, you need to back

00:07:36.443 --> 00:07:44.660 line:100% position:50% align:middle
text, order-this.props.params.storeID.
Then if there is something in

00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:48.930 line:100% position:50% align:middle
local storage, because it very well may be
that there's nothing in local storage, so

00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:57.030 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we need to check. If there is a local
storage ref, then we need to update our

00:07:57.030 --> 00:08:07.727 line:100% position:50% align:middle
app component, order state, then we say
this.setState. Then we're going to update

00:08:07.727 --> 00:08:10.450 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the order state,
which is going to be...

00:08:10.450 --> 00:08:15.590 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you might think it's local storage ref,
but again, that's just going to give us

00:08:15.590 --> 00:08:20.830 line:100% position:50% align:middle
this, fish one... let me add a couple
more to it. That's just a string,

00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:25.700 line:100% position:50% align:middle
so how do you turn a string back into an
object? Well we do the opposite of

00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:29.970 line:100% position:50% align:middle
json.stringify, and it's json.parse.
And that will turn the string that we

00:08:29.970 --> 00:08:35.170 line:100% position:50% align:middle
stored in local storage back into an
actual object here. So good,

00:08:35.170 --> 00:08:41.220 line:100% position:50% align:middle
give that a save. Hey hey, there we go,
works already. Every time I refresh now,

00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:44.980 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you will be able to see one pound
Atlantic, and I can update that.

00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:48.960 line:100% position:50% align:middle
It's all being stored in local storage,
and we can refresh it.

00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:54.990 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So there is a split second right there
where it does render, and then it actually

00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:58.740 line:100% position:50% align:middle
fixes itself. You see it says, "Sorry,
it's not available," I'm not sure if you

00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:03.780 line:100% position:50% align:middle
can catch that. And that's just because
the actual application component is

00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:07.530 line:100% position:50% align:middle
rendering to the page, and then our local
storage ref is updating.

00:09:07.530 --> 00:09:11.208 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So it's sort of doing a double render. I'm
going to leave it at that just because

00:09:11.208 --> 00:09:15.930 line:100% position:50% align:middle
for simplicity's sake. However,
you could use one of the life cycle hooks

00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:21.460 line:100% position:50% align:middle
called shouldComponentUpdate, right
here. Invoke before rendering when new

00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:28.260 line:100% position:50% align:middle
props or states are being received. So,
componentWillUpdate gives us the new

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:32.457 line:100% position:50% align:middle
props and the new state. And
shouldComponentUpdate also gives us the

00:09:32.457 --> 00:09:38.020 line:100% position:50% align:middle
new props and the new state. However, that
will... instead of us setting it in local

00:09:38.020 --> 00:09:42.880 line:100% position:50% align:middle
storage, we will be able to tell React if
that component should re-render.

00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:47.580 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we're kind of getting a double render
happening here, and shouldComponentUpdate

00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:52.250 line:100% position:50% align:middle
allows you to return true or return false
from this actual method.

00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:56.130 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And then if... let's say you've got like,
four or five pieces of data coming in, and

00:09:56.130 --> 00:09:59.800 line:100% position:50% align:middle
every time a new piece of data comes in,
that component re-renders itself.

00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:04.040 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Maybe you want it to wait for four, five
of those pieces of data to all come in,

00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:07.640 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and then re-render, that's where
shouldComponentUpdate sort of comes in,

00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:12.320 line:100% position:50% align:middle
where you could say, if I have all five
pieces of data or if I then have my order

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:16.820 line:100% position:50% align:middle
state properly, then return true, and that
will cause it to re-render.

00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:20.450 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Otherwise, return false, and then that's
just going to... it's going to stop right

00:10:20.450 --> 00:10:24.340 line:100% position:50% align:middle
there. It's going to say, okay I have new
data but I'm not going to re-render myself

00:10:24.340 --> 00:10:29.300 line:100% position:50% align:middle
on the page until someone returns true
from this. So there's a whole bunch of

00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:33.820 line:100% position:50% align:middle
different life cycle hooks, and what I
probably recommend here is look through

00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:37.170 line:100% position:50% align:middle
every single life cycle hook is in there,
read through what it does,

00:10:37.170 --> 00:10:41.070 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and then you sort of have them in the back
of your mind so that when you've come upon

00:10:41.070 --> 00:10:43.807 line:100% position:50% align:middle
a problem, you could say,
"Oh, I can probably fix it

00:10:43.807 --> 00:10:46.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
with one of these life cycle hooks."
