All right our first component, which is
going to be this StorePicker component.

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:14.212 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Where you type in the name of the
store or it auto fills with a

00:00:14.212 --> 00:00:17.036 line:100% position:50% align:middle
hilarious one. And then we have
a button that when you click it,

00:00:17.036 --> 00:00:19.807 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it's going to push you to that actual
store. So if you look

00:00:19.807 --> 00:00:22.510 line:100% position:50% align:middle
at our React DevTools here,
you'll see that there is a

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:26.348 line:100% position:50% align:middle
StorePicker component. We're going
to build that first ,and then we're

00:00:26.348 --> 00:00:30.561 line:100% position:50% align:middle
going to hook up the visit store, which
is going to push the actual URL for it.

00:00:30.561 --> 00:00:34.900 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So where do we write that code? Well let's
first write it in index.js and then we'll

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:39.073 line:100% position:50% align:middle
move it over to the separate components
folder here. Now before we write any

00:00:39.073 --> 00:00:42.674 line:100% position:50% align:middle
React, what do we need? We need to load
in React just like before you write

00:00:42.674 --> 00:00:46.133 line:100% position:50% align:middle
jQuery, you need to load in jQuery.
And you might be thinking, "Okay I'll

00:00:46.133 --> 00:00:52.355 line:100% position:50% align:middle
go into my index.html, and I'll give
myself a script source, and I will

00:00:52.355 --> 00:00:55.380 line:100% position:50% align:middle
say react.js, and then it's on the page,
and I'm good to go."

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:57.918 line:100% position:50% align:middle
However modern JavaScript is done
a little bit differently,

00:00:57.918 --> 00:01:01.772 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and we're going to be using
what's called ES6 modules where we can

00:01:01.772 --> 00:01:06.190 line:100% position:50% align:middle
import it. So rather than using a script
tag to load in every single library that

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:10.950 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you want, you go into the code that you're
writing, in this case index.js, and we're

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:17.080 line:100% position:50% align:middle
going to import React, capital R,
from and then a string of `react`.

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.880 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And what that does is it's going to load
everything that is in the React library

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.680 line:100% position:50% align:middle
into this variable called React. Now where
is this coming from?

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.094 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Well in the first video, if you open
up our package.json, you'll know

00:01:30.094 --> 00:01:35.306 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that I have already gone ahead and listed
all of the things that we need for this

00:01:35.306 --> 00:01:40.498 line:100% position:50% align:middle
tutorial to work. And one of them being
`react` and `react-dom` and `react-router`

00:01:40.498 --> 00:01:45.419 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and 'react-addons-css...` all of these
different things. So if I didn't do that,

00:01:45.419 --> 00:01:49.600 line:100% position:50% align:middle
what you would have had to do is go
to your terminal here, but quit this first

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:54.844 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"npm install react --save", and that will
go and fetch the React library

00:01:54.844 --> 00:01:58.256 line:100% position:50% align:middle
as well as save that dependency
to your package.json.

00:01:58.256 --> 00:02:01.960 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So really
important, this entire tutorial I do not

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:06.820 line:100% position:50% align:middle
need you to `npm install` anything. Why?
Because this tutorial has already come

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:09.821 line:100% position:50% align:middle
with a list of things that you need,
as well as the versions that are going

00:02:09.821 --> 00:02:14.397 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to work the best. These are the latest
versions as of time of recording, and I

00:02:14.397 --> 00:02:18.271 line:100% position:50% align:middle
just want to make sure that everybody's
on the exact same version for the duration

00:02:18.271 --> 00:02:23.440 line:100% position:50% align:middle
of this course until things get updated
and then it's time to re-record them.

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.460 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So you do not need to `npm install`
anything, you simply just need to type "npm

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:30.994 line:100% position:50% align:middle
install" on our first video, which we did
already. And then you type "npm start",

00:02:30.994 --> 00:02:36.140 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to kickstart our Webpack and server
that will open itself on up.

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.605 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Let's go over to our index.js here.
And we've imported React from `react`.

00:02:40.605 --> 00:02:45.475 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now I'm going to open up this localhost
in the browser here. First of all, a

00:02:45.475 --> 00:02:48.999 line:100% position:50% align:middle
couple things, you're going to sometimes
see these warnings here, and that's

00:02:48.999 --> 00:02:54.398 line:100% position:50% align:middle
something called ESLint. ESLint is a
linter which sort of will smack your hand

00:02:54.398 --> 00:02:59.607 line:100% position:50% align:middle
when you do things that aren't in the
best interest of writing good React code,

00:02:59.607 --> 00:03:03.225 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and it's okay if you sometimes see these.
We're going to run into them,

00:03:03.225 --> 00:03:07.577 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and we'll show you how to fix them.
The Create React App comes

00:03:07.577 --> 00:03:12.096 line:100% position:50% align:middle
with a very minimal set of ESLint
rules, and then we'll show you how

00:03:12.096 --> 00:03:15.593 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you can break out, or eject out of it,
if you'd like to use your own

00:03:15.593 --> 00:03:19.036 line:100% position:50% align:middle
ESLint rules, if you're comfortable
with that. However, what I want to show

00:03:19.036 --> 00:03:23.070 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you is that if we go to our elements
panel, you'll see that the script tag

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:28.380 line:100% position:50% align:middle
has been added. That gets added by the
dev server. And it gives us the static

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:33.633 line:100% position:50% align:middle
bundle js. If I were to go to that URL
here, you'll see that...Look at this.

00:03:33.633 --> 00:03:40.067 line:100% position:50% align:middle
All this code here, this is React,
right? only because I imported React

00:03:40.067 --> 00:03:44.776 line:100% position:50% align:middle
from `react`. If I take it out and refresh
this URL you're going to see that React

00:03:44.776 --> 00:03:47.857 line:100% position:50% align:middle
is no longer in there. There's a whole
bunch of stuff. This is all Webpack dev-server

00:03:47.857 --> 00:03:51.608 line:100% position:50% align:middle
stuff. That's totally fine.
That stuff's not included when you

00:03:51.608 --> 00:03:55.711 line:100% position:50% align:middle
actually deploy it to your application,
but if I were to write "alert('hello')",

00:03:55.711 --> 00:04:02.939 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and refresh this, you will see if I
search for it. There we go, there is my

00:04:02.939 --> 00:04:07.421 line:100% position:50% align:middle
actual `alert` code. So any code that gets
written in this index.js is going

00:04:07.421 --> 00:04:11.398 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to be bundled into your bundle.js file,
and this is...again this is a

00:04:11.398 --> 00:04:14.668 line:100% position:50% align:middle
development version. So there is going
to be a whole bunch of other stuff

00:04:14.668 --> 00:04:18.361 line:100% position:50% align:middle
in here that's just for development,
and we're going to learn

00:04:18.361 --> 00:04:22.731 line:100% position:50% align:middle
how do we take that out for production
mode? So we want to go back to "import

00:04:22.731 --> 00:04:26.140 line:100% position:50% align:middle
React from `react`," and we want
to create our first component.

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:28.999 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And the way that we do that is we
say "class", and we're going to be using

00:04:28.999 --> 00:04:33.801 line:100% position:50% align:middle
ES6 classes here. And we'll look at what
the difference is between the two.

00:04:33.801 --> 00:04:40.293 line:100% position:50% align:middle
But we'll say "class StorePicker", and we
use a capital on the front of all of our

00:04:40.293 --> 00:04:44.770 line:100% position:50% align:middle
components because they can be used more
than once. And we're going to say "extends",

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:51.930 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and it's going to extend "React.Component",
and open up and close your curly brackets.

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:57.667 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now that is our very basic component.
In every single component that you build,

00:04:57.667 --> 00:05:02.638 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it means at least one method, and that
is the render() method. So when a component

00:05:02.638 --> 00:05:07.779 line:100% position:50% align:middle
gets rendered to the actual page, it will
ask StorePicker "what HTML should

00:05:07.779 --> 00:05:15.094 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I display?" So we type "render()", and if you
are new to ES6 classes, this is sort

00:05:15.094 --> 00:05:21.176 line:100% position:50% align:middle
of similar to doing something like this
like "function store()"-- sorry, "render()",

00:05:21.176 --> 00:05:25.882 line:100% position:50% align:middle
something like that. However, we just
write it like this here, and then

00:05:25.882 --> 00:05:30.373 line:100% position:50% align:middle
inside of this render() we are going
to return some JSX.

00:05:30.373 --> 00:05:32.828 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We'll learn about more of that in the
video. So we'll say "return",

00:05:32.828 --> 00:05:36.250 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I'm just going to have a paragraph
that says "Hello", and close

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:41.230 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that up. Now that is our StorePicker
component. How do I get it to actually

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:45.764 line:100% position:50% align:middle
render onto the page? If you open up your
HTML here, you're going to see that we

00:05:45.764 --> 00:05:50.004 line:100% position:50% align:middle
have an empty div right here. Div with the
id of "main," and this is where the React

00:05:50.004 --> 00:05:54.194 line:100% position:50% align:middle
app is going to go. This is called a
mounting point for us with a div with the

00:05:54.194 --> 00:06:00.031 line:100% position:50% align:middle
id of "main." So what we do here, is we
need to go and grab `react-dom`

00:06:00.031 --> 00:06:03.379 line:100% position:50% align:middle
because React is not just for HTML
in the DOM.

00:06:03.379 --> 00:06:07.705 line:100% position:50% align:middle
It can also be used to create
Android apps as well as iOS

00:06:07.705 --> 00:06:12.791 line:100% position:50% align:middle
apps, and there is a `canvas` render.
So where React renders out to is not just

00:06:12.791 --> 00:06:17.820 line:100% position:50% align:middle
HTML, but in our case we actually want it
to render to HTML. So we need to import

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:23.640 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the render() method from a package called
"react-dom." Now sometimes you may see

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:29.856 line:100% position:50% align:middle
people say import reactDOM
from 'react-dom,' and then what we're

00:06:29.856 --> 00:06:35.840 line:100% position:50% align:middle
going to do is down here we'll say
"ReactDom.render()", but in our case, we

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:39.411 line:100% position:50% align:middle
don't need the entire `react-dom` package.
We just need that one render() method.

00:06:39.411 --> 00:06:45.596 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So rather than import the entire package,
we just import one of the methods

00:06:45.596 --> 00:06:49.205 line:100% position:50% align:middle
from it, and that's what these
curly brackets in ES6 will do.

00:06:49.205 --> 00:06:52.541 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So what we do is say "render()",
and the first thing that we

00:06:52.541 --> 00:06:56.588 line:100% position:50% align:middle
pass it is what component would we
like to render. In our case, it's going

00:06:56.588 --> 00:07:01.881 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to be StorePicker. So here we say
"<StorePicker/>", and this is JSX here

00:07:01.881 --> 00:07:04.223 line:100% position:50% align:middle
because we created this
component, and when you

00:07:04.223 --> 00:07:08.040 line:100% position:50% align:middle
want to render out a component,
you open up a tag, you type the name

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:11.599 line:100% position:50% align:middle
of the component, and then you
close the actual component itself.

00:07:11.599 --> 00:07:16.957 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And then the second thing is what
DOM element should it render out to?

00:07:16.957 --> 00:07:21.520 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we have a div with the id of "main." How
do we select that? Well we can just use

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:27.780 line:100% position:50% align:middle
document.querySelector, and we'll pass it
with an id of "main." You could also use

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:32.910 line:100% position:50% align:middle
document.getElementById there. So now,
if I save that, and go back to our

00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:37.760 line:100% position:50% align:middle
application...Oh, there we go. Look all
ready you see "Hello," now if we go to our

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:41.900 line:100% position:50% align:middle
React Dev ools, you'll see that the 
StorePicker component has been rendered to the

00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:48.240 line:100% position:50% align:middle
page, and that's pretty much it. Now it's
a best practice to put each of your

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:55.096 line:100% position:50% align:middle
components in a separate file. So rather
than us build our entire application

00:07:55.096 --> 00:07:58.959 line:100% position:50% align:middle
in one file, and there's nothing wrong
with that. However, it's a little bit

00:07:58.959 --> 00:08:05.400 line:100% position:50% align:middle
easier to maintain it if we put each
of our components in their own files.

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:09.650 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So what I like to do is go to `components`
here. I'm going to create a file.

00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:15.165 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And I'm going to name it StorePicker.js
and I'm naming it exactly as the component

00:08:15.165 --> 00:08:21.803 line:100% position:50% align:middle
is named. And I'm going to take this
component here and I'm going to go

00:08:21.803 --> 00:08:26.700 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to StorePicker.js and paste it there. Now
you might think that's all we need to do

00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:30.039 line:100% position:50% align:middle
in order for it to actually work.
But there's a couple of things that need

00:08:30.039 --> 00:08:35.059 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to happen here. First of all, we need
React, so we need to import React

00:08:35.059 --> 00:08:38.982 line:100% position:50% align:middle
from `react`, and you're going to have
to do that in the top of every

00:08:38.982 --> 00:08:42.437 line:100% position:50% align:middle
single component. Not like jQuery, where
you load on the page, and it's

00:08:42.437 --> 00:08:46.071 line:100% position:50% align:middle
available to everyone. With ES6
modules, if you need something

00:08:46.071 --> 00:08:49.916 line:100% position:50% align:middle
inside of of these JS modules here,
you need to make sure

00:08:49.916 --> 00:08:53.550 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that you import it inside of every
single file that you need it.

00:08:53.550 --> 00:08:58.267 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we've imported React. We've needed it.
We create this class here, and then what

00:08:58.267 --> 00:09:03.228 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we would do is we type "export default
StorePicker;", and what that's going

00:09:03.228 --> 00:09:07.214 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to allow us to do is we've created this
tidy little component that we can go

00:09:07.214 --> 00:09:16.651 line:100% position:50% align:middle
back into our index.js and we will say
"import StorePicker from," now you might

00:09:16.651 --> 00:09:21.464 line:100% position:50% align:middle
think we just type "StorePicker" right?
However, if it's just a string, Webpack

00:09:21.464 --> 00:09:24.983 line:100% position:50% align:middle
thinks that you look in the node_modules
directory, and this is not a node module.

00:09:24.983 --> 00:09:29.440 line:100% position:50% align:middle
This is a module that we've created our
actual selves. So we need to do what's

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:34.910 line:100% position:50% align:middle
called a relative path, so "./" for in the 
index.html, we need to go inside of the

00:09:34.910 --> 00:09:39.967 line:100% position:50% align:middle
`components` folder, and we want to look
for StorePicker. You don't need the ".js"

00:09:39.967 --> 00:09:45.058 line:100% position:50% align:middle
on the end. It's assumed, so you can just
simply type "StorePicker." So if we refresh,

00:09:45.058 --> 00:09:51.250 line:100% position:50% align:middle
nothing should have happened because we
have just sort of refactored it, made the

00:09:51.250 --> 00:09:54.353 line:100% position:50% align:middle
component inside of here, and this
is nice. We're going to be able to go

00:09:54.353 --> 00:09:57.325 line:100% position:50% align:middle
into the StorePicker every time that we
need to edit it.  And we don't have

00:09:57.325 --> 00:10:01.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to scroll through a thousand
lines of code in order to work with it.
