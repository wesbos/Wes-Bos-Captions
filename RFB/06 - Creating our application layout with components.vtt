00:00:00.109 --> 00:00:02.692
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:08.730
<v Speaker>Next up we need to make our App component</v>

3
00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.450
and the App component is going to be sort

4
00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:11.650
of like the momma component

5
00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:13.840
that's gonna hold all of our children,

6
00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:15.320
and then inside of that we're going

7
00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:17.930
to have a header component which is gonna show us the title.

8
00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:19.920
We're going to have a bunch of fish components

9
00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.160
which are going to render out a picture and the title,

10
00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.650
a description, and the ability to add it to our order.

11
00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.510
Then we have an order component here,

12
00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.380
and an inventory component.

13
00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:31.100
All of these things are going to be siblings

14
00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:34.190
and they will all be a child of the App component

15
00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.550
which is going to allow us to share things like, data.

16
00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.100
So if I were to change this data to a different value

17
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.950
it's going to update across all three of them.

18
00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.020
It's gonna allow us to share things like methods,

19
00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:49.790
where if I were to remove a fish from here,

20
00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:51.760
it's going to remove it from here

21
00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.370
as well as update our order.

22
00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:54.882
That's going to sort of essentialize

23
00:00:54.882 --> 00:00:58.120
both the data and the functionality

24
00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:59.580
of the events that need to happen.

25
00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:02.140
So, let's go back over to our catch of the day

26
00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:06.050
and open up our sidebar that we've got here.

27
00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:08.138
By the way, maybe I should show you that real quick.

28
00:01:08.138 --> 00:01:10.520
If you're wondering why sometimes when I like,

29
00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.430
goof up the indentation or if I use a single quote

30
00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:17.680
or a double quote, something like that,

31
00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.270
and then I give a save and it just, whoop,

32
00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:21.350
all automatically fixed, for me,

33
00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.710
that's because I'm using something called Prettier

34
00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:25.420
and you can go ahead and find an extension

35
00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:27.155
for your editor called Prettier.

36
00:01:27.155 --> 00:01:29.620
And it's great for React because

37
00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:32.210
it'll often do things like, maybe, for example,

38
00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.930
in here, if I have like an open hi tag

39
00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.550
and it'll automatically close the hi tag

40
00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:41.120
and then if I were to give that a save,

41
00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.530
it says, "oh, well, there's nothing in between here,

42
00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.870
there's no child, so why don't you just self close."

43
00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:49.270
So there's a lot of like, nice, little,

44
00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.610
fixes that you can get when you turn on Prettier.

45
00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:53.700
It's totally different for every single editor

46
00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.390
and even in VS Code you can either configure it

47
00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.700
via the Prettier plugin via an ESLint.

48
00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.040
So I'm gonna leave that to another tutorial,

49
00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:02.820
but definitely check that out

50
00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.360
if you're getting a little bit frustrated

51
00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.150
with the formatting in React.

52
00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:08.160
So, we wanna go into our components here.

53
00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.220
I'm gonna make a new file in the components directory.

54
00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.610
I'm gonna call it App.js with a capital a.

55
00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:15.720
Good.

56
00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.290
Give that a save, and inside of that,

57
00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:19.460
what is the first thing we need?

58
00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:21.180
Well, we need React.

59
00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.211
We need to import that from our React package.

60
00:02:23.211 --> 00:02:26.020
Then we need to make our App components.

61
00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:29.920
We'll say class App, capital a, extends,

62
00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:32.530
React.Component.

63
00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.270
And then let's go ahead.

64
00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:37.280
Before you even do that, I often will, like,

65
00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.010
start typing the render method.

66
00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:42.616
But before you even do that go ahead and export default App

67
00:02:42.616 --> 00:02:44.336
because the amount of times that I forgot

68
00:02:44.336 --> 00:02:47.240
to actually export it from a file,

69
00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:49.510
that just causes headaches, so export it right away.

70
00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.540
You might even may want to make a nice little snippet

71
00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.550
for you editor that does exactly this.

72
00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:56.550
Now inside of it we need our render method

73
00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:58.160
which shows what we have.

74
00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:59.870
And from that, we're going to return,

75
00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:03.630
and I showed you in a couple of videos ago how to return.

76
00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:04.620
Parenthesis.

77
00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.202
And inside of that, let's just give ourselves

78
00:03:07.202 --> 00:03:11.010
maybe a div with a class of catch of the day.

79
00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.380
Beautiful.

80
00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:18.040
Put a paragraph, "heyyy!"

81
00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:18.990
Good.

82
00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:22.185
Now, we will go back to our App and,

83
00:03:22.185 --> 00:03:24.780
if I refresh it, nothing's changed.

84
00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:26.840
And that's because if we go back to our

85
00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.890
index.js file we're still hard-coding the store picker

86
00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:33.200
which is good for the front page,

87
00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.770
but as soon as I, here let me show you,

88
00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:37.320
that's the store picker.

89
00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:39.330
But as soon as I go to an actual page,

90
00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:41.646
then I wanna change to the App.

91
00:03:41.646 --> 00:03:44.370
We're gonna figure out how to do that with routing,

92
00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:47.610
but for now, let's just hard-code that App component.

93
00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:50.210
So, we'll duplicate this one here

94
00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:52.760
and change it over to the App component.

95
00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:57.210
And then we'll just render out the App component.

96
00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:59.200
Getting some errors here.

97
00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.760
"You're render method should have a return statement."

98
00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.928
So go back to our App.js.

99
00:04:04.928 --> 00:04:08.320
Oh, how does return even work?

100
00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:10.930
You have to be able to spell in order to code.

101
00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:11.763
Okay.

102
00:04:11.763 --> 00:04:13.700
So I've got my App component working

103
00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:17.060
and if we go to our React you see that the REC=DEV tools

104
00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:19.390
that we have are App component rendering out.

105
00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:21.820
Inside of that we have a div with a class name

106
00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:23.870
of catch of the day.

107
00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:25.740
Then inside of that we'll give ourselves a div

108
00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:27.080
with a class of menu.

109
00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:30.430
Again, make sure you hit that class name instead of class.

110
00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:32.890
And inside of that we are going to,

111
00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:35.370
let's just scaffold out what the components are

112
00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:36.570
that we're going to make.

113
00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:38.790
So we're going to have a header component,

114
00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:41.260
and that's going to look like this.

115
00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.380
Now, it's going to start erroring out on us

116
00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:45.209
because we haven't yet made that component.

117
00:04:45.209 --> 00:04:47.360
Then underneath that we're gonna have a bunch

118
00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:48.420
of fish components.

119
00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:50.250
It's gonna look a little something like that,

120
00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:51.540
except we haven't gotten there yet

121
00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:54.020
so just put the header in there, for now.

122
00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:57.190
Beside that we want and inventory component,

123
00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:01.030
and beside that we also want an order component.

124
00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:05.560
Now it's going to tell us that header inventory

125
00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:06.700
and order do not work.

126
00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:08.160
Oooh. That's cool.

127
00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:12.640
If you click it, it automatically opens it up in the editor.

128
00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:13.607
I didn't know that.

129
00:05:13.607 --> 00:05:15.180
Neat.

130
00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:16.650
So that's kinda cool.

131
00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:20.016
It'll go right to the file where the thing is broken.

132
00:05:20.016 --> 00:05:22.140
So let's go ahead and make a header inventory

133
00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:22.973
and order component.

134
00:05:22.973 --> 00:05:25.810
So back to our components folder, new file,

135
00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:27.080
we'll call it header.js.

136
00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.110
And if you want to at this point,

137
00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:32.780
maybe code it by hand once more,

138
00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:33.613
but you're probably going

139
00:05:33.613 --> 00:05:35.600
to be copying pasting it fairly often

140
00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:37.450
so we'll import React from React

141
00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:44.440
and then we'll class header extends React.component.

142
00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:48.150
That needs a render method.

143
00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:50.470
We'll come back to that in just a second.

144
00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:55.370
Then we'll export default header.

145
00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:57.270
And inside of the render method we're going

146
00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:00.000
to return in actual header tags.

147
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.400
So this is just a regular html header tag

148
00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:04.300
with a class of top.

149
00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:06.650
And inside of that, let's just give ourselves h1

150
00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:09.520
that says catch of the day.

151
00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:12.810
We'll come back to the styling of that in just a second.

152
00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:15.850
Underneath that we want a h3 class of tagline.

153
00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:17.820
These are just matching up with all the styles

154
00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:19.600
that I've pre-written for you.

155
00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:23.330
And then inside of that we need a span

156
00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:27.030
that just says fresh daily or whatever it is

157
00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:27.863
that you like to show.

158
00:06:27.863 --> 00:06:29.630
We're gonna swap that out, not gonna hard-code it,

159
00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:30.740
in just a second.

160
00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:32.077
So give that a save.

161
00:06:32.077 --> 00:06:34.870
If you wanna see how it works

162
00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:36.460
then we'll go back to our App,

163
00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:40.690
let me just comment out inventory in order real quick,

164
00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:41.670
and we should...

165
00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:43.930
Oh, (laughs) why doesn't it work?

166
00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:46.360
Well, we have made the header component

167
00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:49.750
but we have not yet imported it into the file that we need.

168
00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:51.280
So, this is kinda interesting.

169
00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:53.947
We don't need to import it into our index.js,

170
00:06:53.947 --> 00:06:56.640
it's unnecessary to import things

171
00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:59.090
that are not used in that exact file.

172
00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:01.110
You just need to import into the file

173
00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:02.580
where it's going to be used.

174
00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:05.560
So, import the header from, and now it's a sibling,

175
00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:07.760
we're already in the components folder

176
00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:10.170
in a file called App.js so we'll just go

177
00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:12.380
to a sibling and we'll say import it

178
00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:14.740
from the header.js file.

179
00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:17.550
Now if I give that a save it should show us the header.

180
00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:20.320
Oh, now it's giving me some grief here.

181
00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:24.620
Adjacent.jsxl must be wrapped in an enclosing tag.

182
00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:27.220
What did we do inside of App?

183
00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:29.500
What did we do inside of here?

184
00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:32.850
Oh, obviously that h3 tag needs to go inside

185
00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:33.990
of the header tag.

186
00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:36.300
And then you see that this is showing up

187
00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:38.420
for us which looks great.

188
00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:41.370
And let's just get it matched up to what this looks like.

189
00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:43.160
I have spans wrapped around the 'of the'

190
00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:46.310
and then around each of the words 'of' and 'the'.

191
00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:48.010
So we'll go back to our header.js,

192
00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:50.320
and it's of.

193
00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:54.690
Put of and the on it's own line,

194
00:07:54.690 --> 00:07:57.670
and we're gonna wrap the entire thing in a class of of the.

195
00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:02.310
And then we're gonna wrap each of the words

196
00:08:02.310 --> 00:08:04.640
in a span of the class of of,

197
00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:06.440
and a span of the class of the.

198
00:08:07.690 --> 00:08:11.910
So h1, catch, span of the class ofThe,

199
00:08:12.890 --> 00:08:15.780
then get an of and the the and finally the day,

200
00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:17.250
and that should...

201
00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:18.083
There we go.

202
00:08:18.083 --> 00:08:19.930
We hit the little anchor and the formatting

203
00:08:19.930 --> 00:08:21.680
of CSS has kicked in.

204
00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:23.480
And if we open this up, you see App,

205
00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:24.970
and we have our header component.

206
00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:27.010
Let's go off and finish the other two,

207
00:08:27.010 --> 00:08:30.339
which is our inventory and our order component.

208
00:08:30.339 --> 00:08:32.160
Actually, those go the other way around.

209
00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:35.170
It's the order and then the inventory component.

210
00:08:35.170 --> 00:08:36.420
It's gonna start yelling at us

211
00:08:36.420 --> 00:08:37.980
cause we haven't yet imported them,

212
00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:41.610
so what I like to do is just duplicate this over,

213
00:08:41.610 --> 00:08:46.540
and then select order, and then do that again for inventory.

214
00:08:49.470 --> 00:08:50.480
Now, it's gonna tell us

215
00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:53.930
that it cannot find a component called inventory

216
00:08:53.930 --> 00:08:55.100
cause we haven't yet made it.

217
00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:56.890
So, we'll go in, and what I like

218
00:08:56.890 --> 00:08:58.740
to do in a case like this is just

219
00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:03.040
to save a copy of header and just make that inventory.

220
00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:10.070
And then I will get rid of all the html inside of there,

221
00:09:10.070 --> 00:09:12.810
and we'll just return a div with a class of inventory,

222
00:09:17.510 --> 00:09:18.960
and then rename the component.

223
00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:20.080
This is kind of important.

224
00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:21.830
Sometimes I forget to...

225
00:09:21.830 --> 00:09:25.360
It will still work if you export it as header,

226
00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:28.090
however, it will show up as header in your div tools

227
00:09:28.090 --> 00:09:29.090
which is a bit confusing.

228
00:09:29.090 --> 00:09:31.670
So, make sure you rename that to inventory.

229
00:09:33.550 --> 00:09:34.680
And that's up and running.

230
00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:36.780
One actually cool thing that Prettier does

231
00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:38.940
for me is if it just does a one liner,

232
00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:40.800
you're using parenthesis here,

233
00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:42.520
and you only have a one liner,

234
00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:44.900
it's gonna tell you, "hey, that's not necessary."

235
00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:47.720
I can do that on one line so it'll just get rid of them.

236
00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:50.940
So I might have to put those back in at a later time.

237
00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:53.000
I'll save that again.

238
00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.770
Give ourselves an order.js.

239
00:09:54.770 --> 00:09:57.220
Remember to use capitals on all these file names.

240
00:09:57.220 --> 00:10:00.830
We'll just call this order,

241
00:10:00.830 --> 00:10:03.150
give it div the class name of order.

242
00:10:04.990 --> 00:10:05.823
Beautiful.

243
00:10:05.823 --> 00:10:06.820
So we have our order in the middle,

244
00:10:06.820 --> 00:10:09.410
our inventory on the right and our catch of the day.

245
00:10:09.410 --> 00:10:11.400
Obviously I am too squished here

246
00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:13.970
so I'm gonna bring that down to the bottom.

247
00:10:13.970 --> 00:10:15.980
And everything is looking good.

248
00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:18.270
I also have this cheesy little fold button here

249
00:10:18.270 --> 00:10:19.900
which has nothing to do with React,

250
00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:22.970
it's just when it's checked it will apply

251
00:10:22.970 --> 00:10:26.880
some CSS that puts a transform and skew on this

252
00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:28.360
to make it look a little bit 3D.

253
00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:29.670
It's kinda fun to have on.

254
00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:32.840
So that is a sort of a scaffold out of our application.

255
00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:34.421
We have the main bones.

256
00:10:34.421 --> 00:10:37.010
Let's move onto the next one which is talking about

257
00:10:37.010 --> 00:10:41.110
how do we make this header component somewhat dynamic

258
00:10:41.110 --> 00:10:44.010
because we have just been hard-coding the values in there.
