We want to make the app layout and
that's this whole thing is going to be our

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.090 line:100% position:50% align:middle
app, and then inside of app we're going to
have...we got a Header component,

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:18.310 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we've got a whole bunch of Fish components
here. We've got our Order component and

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:23.250 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we've got our Inventory component. So
let's sort of scaffold that out and then

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.750 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we'll go into each component
and sort of hook them on up.

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:29.140 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So go back to our Sublime Text or whatever
editor you're using here,

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:33.186 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and we want to make a new component and
I'm going to call that "App.js."

00:00:33.186 --> 00:00:37.390 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And what you can do is you can pretty
much just take...if you're comfortable

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:40.080 line:100% position:50% align:middle
with this already, you can take it from
StorePicker and put it in App.

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:43.700 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I'm going to go through it once more with
you. So first we need React,

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:50.930 line:100% position:50% align:middle
then we want to make a component for our
application, so say, "class App extends,

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:54.290 line:100% position:50% align:middle
React.component."

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:57.860 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And what is the one method that you
absolutely need on all of your components?

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:02.550 line:100% position:50% align:middle
You need a render() method. And inside of
that what we're going to do,

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.460 line:100% position:50% align:middle
is we're going to return some JSX. So we
open and close these parentheses here

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:13.900 line:100% position:50% align:middle
because we're entering in multiple lines
of JSX. And then we need a div with the

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:23.700 line:100% position:50% align:middle
class of "catch-of-the-day," and inside of
that, we're going to have a menu.

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.530 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Inside of that, we're going to have a
Header component.

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.050 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now, this here Header, capital H, it's not
the same thing as a <header> tag.

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:34.190 line:100% position:50% align:middle
It's a component that we are actually
going to make. I'm going to put it in

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:37.890 line:100% position:50% align:middle
there and we'll see why that will break
and how we can fix that.

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.500 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And then below here, we're going
to...eventually, we're going to have a

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.040 line:100% position:50% align:middle
whole bunch of these Fish components here.
So we're just going to have <Fish/>,

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.340 line:100% position:50% align:middle
<Fish/>, <Fish/>, <Fish/>, over and over. But we
haven't done that yet,

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.060 line:100% position:50% align:middle
so I'm just going to leave it right at
Header.

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:55.750 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And then down here, we are going to have
an Order component and we need the

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:02.160 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Inventory component. So give that a save
and we head back to our Google

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:07.120 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Chrome here, nothing changed. And why is
still rendering StorePicker?

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:10.160 line:100% position:50% align:middle
It's because our render() method here is
still rendering out the StorePicker,

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:15.390 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it makes sense, right? So we need to go
back into here. We need to export

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.400 line:100% position:50% align:middle
default App. We need to go back into our
index.js

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.500 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and we're going to get into routing in a
future video where if you're on the home

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.380 line:100% position:50% align:middle
page, it'll show you StorePicker,
otherwise, it's going to show you the App

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.930 line:100% position:50% align:middle
component, sort of like one or the other.
But we haven't hooked up routing yet.

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:36.360 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So what I want to do is just import the
App component from our components

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:43.290 line:100% position:50% align:middle
directory and then we'll render out the
App component here.

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.700 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Save, go back. See, now it refreshes.
Nothing here. Let's see what our dev tools

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.370 line:100% position:50% align:middle
is telling us. It's telling us we have an
error here: "ReferenceError: Header is not

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:56.150 line:100% position:50% align:middle
defined." The reason we get that is because
we have not yet made this Header component

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.970 line:100% position:50% align:middle
nor have we made the Order component or
the Inventory component. So let's go to

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:04.580 line:100% position:50% align:middle
our components directory here, a new file,
make a Header.js so we'll start to see

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:11.630 line:100% position:50% align:middle
a pattern of making new components. We
need to grab React. We're going to make

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:15.692 line:100% position:50% align:middle
ourselves a class.

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:25.010 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And then what is the one method you always
need? Is render() inside of that.

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:31.020 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Let's just `return`. Let's just give
ourselves a paragraph tag for now that

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:38.240 line:100% position:50% align:middle
says "Header" and then, of course, we need
to export default Header. Now that we've

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:41.680 line:100% position:50% align:middle
made this Header component, we need to go
back to our App.js file.

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:48.310 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We've used it here, so we need to import
Header from './Header'; Why not use the

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:52.150 line:100% position:50% align:middle
components folder? Because we're
already in App.js and we're just going to

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:55.300 line:100% position:50% align:middle
a sibling file here called Header.js.

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:59.580 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now, if I give that a save, it's going to
start to complain that it cannot find

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:04.530 line:100% position:50% align:middle
module "React." Capital R there. But
now it's complaining that Order is not

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:08.530 line:100% position:50% align:middle
defined and that's just because we haven't
done Order and we haven't done Inventory

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:12.950 line:100% position:50% align:middle
yet. So if I just temporarily take those
out to see Header is now rendered to

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:18.680 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the page but we need to do the exact same
thing we did on Header for Order as well

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:24.459 line:100% position:50% align:middle
as Inventory. So I'm just going to take a
copy and name it Order.js. And I grab

00:04:24.459 --> 00:04:29.414 line:100% position:50% align:middle
every instance and name it Order.
And then I can name this Inventory.js.

00:04:29.414 --> 00:04:33.420 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Grab every instance of
Order and name it Inventory.

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:39.320 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Finally, we'll go to our App here, I'm
going to grab Header and say,

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:43.096 line:100% position:50% align:middle
import Order. We'll also want
to import Inventory.

00:04:43.096 --> 00:04:46.044 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Good, so we have just made...that was

00:04:46.044 --> 00:04:50.380 line:100% position:50% align:middle
pretty quick, but we just made three like
really simple components; Inventory,

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:56.090 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Order and Header. And now when we refresh,
we should now see Header,

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:59.860 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Order and Inventory being rendered out,
but our React DevTools here,

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:02.930 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you can see that we have our App
component, inside of that we've got our

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:06.500 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Header component, we've got an Order
component, we've got an Inventory

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:07.611 line:100% position:50% align:middle
component.
