Now I'm going to show you how to deploy it
to a PHP, Apache, you know,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.710 line:100% position:50% align:middle
your Bluehost, GoDaddy, everybody's got
one of these servers kicking around, and

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:19.890 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it just costs a couple bucks a month, and
because it's just an HTML file, it works

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.340 line:100% position:50% align:middle
really, really well for something like
this. So, first I just want to go into our

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:30.080 line:100% position:50% align:middle
index.js.and we'll back off that base name
part because I am going to be deploying

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:36.210 line:100% position:50% align:middle
mine to catchoftheday.westboss.com. If you
are deploying it to a sub-directory

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.020 line:100% position:50% align:middle
instead of a sub-domain, then you do have
to keep this base name in here and let's

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:43.800 line:100% position:50% align:middle
say you were deploying it to
catchoftheday, you would say,

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:51.560 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"/catchoftheday" and then also in your
package.json, open that up again,

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:56.390 line:100% position:50% align:middle
your homepage, again if you are deploying
it to a sub-folder, you have to put in

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:06.261 line:100% position:50% align:middle
westboss.catchoftheday.westboss.com/
whatever the name is here,

00:01:06.261 --> 00:01:12.096 line:100% position:50% align:middle
but in my case since I am deploying
directly to a route, I do not need that

00:01:12.096 --> 00:01:16.778 line:100% position:50% align:middle
one piece in my package.json So I've
deleted that, I have to go up a level,

00:01:16.778 --> 00:01:26.320 line:100% position:50% align:middle
npm run build. Then go into whatever FTP
client you are using to FTP this up, or

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:30.342 line:100% position:50% align:middle
SSH, however you get your files
onto your server, do that.

00:01:30.342 --> 00:01:35.700 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I am just going to go and take my
index.html, and my static and my fav icon,

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.217 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and I'm going to upload all of them,
and you can see that I have my

00:01:39.217 --> 00:01:44.966 line:100% position:50% align:middle
sub-domain already set up here.
And once that's done, if I refresh,

00:01:44.966 --> 00:01:51.467 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we now see catchoftheday, I can visit the
store, I can't log in just yet because I

00:01:51.467 --> 00:01:56.812 line:100% position:50% align:middle
need to...just here, watch, it doesn't
work. But if I go to firebase.google.com,

00:01:56.812 --> 00:02:03.494 line:100% position:50% align:middle
go to my console, go to my actual Firebase
database, go to "Auth," "Sign In" method,

00:02:03.494 --> 00:02:09.093 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and I am going to add westboss.com . You
don't need to add star.westboss.com, it's

00:02:09.093 --> 00:02:15.677 line:100% position:50% align:middle
assumed, and that's okay. So I can "Add"
that. I'm also going to add github.io at

00:02:15.677 --> 00:02:19.288 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the same time. Make sure those domains
are there. So if I refresh this now,

00:02:19.288 --> 00:02:23.214 line:100% position:50% align:middle
first of all, that doesn't work, we will
see why, but go to

00:02:23.214 --> 00:02:27.438 line:100% position:50% align:middle
catchoftheday.westboss.com or whatever
your URL is, visit the store,

00:02:27.438 --> 00:02:32.384 line:100% position:50% align:middle
now if I try to log in with gitHub, it
works just fine because I've added it.

00:02:32.384 --> 00:02:37.922 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I can load up some sample fishes and use
the app as we have, but the problem is

00:02:37.922 --> 00:02:43.706 line:100% position:50% align:middle
again, when we have this
/store/thestorename, if I were to refresh,

00:02:43.706 --> 00:02:49.948 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it's broken again, and why is that? It's
because our server is not doing the

00:02:49.948 --> 00:02:54.632 line:100% position:50% align:middle
routing, our client, React Router, is
doing the routing, and we need to tell our

00:02:54.632 --> 00:03:01.783 line:100% position:50% align:middle
server, "Take everything from this domain
and serve up index.html.

00:03:01.783 --> 00:03:06.268 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Any of these routes you need to serve us
index.html" and we are going to handle the

00:03:06.268 --> 00:03:11.727 line:100% position:50% align:middle
routing for us. So it depends on
what type of server that you have.

00:03:11.727 --> 00:03:17.813 line:100% position:50% align:middle
The most common type of server is called
an Apache server, and you can do that with

00:03:17.813 --> 00:03:24.381 line:100% position:50% align:middle
what's called a .htaccess file. So, I am
going to go into my catchoftheday and

00:03:24.381 --> 00:03:31.508 line:100% position:50% align:middle
create a new file called "htaccess,"
and bring this local if you want.

00:03:31.508 --> 00:03:38.059 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And I'm going to just edit that file.
Inside of that file I need to put a couple

00:03:38.059 --> 00:03:43.544 line:100% position:50% align:middle
rules. I'm going to paste it in here, but
essentially what this does is it creates a

00:03:43.544 --> 00:03:50.439 line:100% position:50% align:middle
rule that whenever you have any
forward slash, just serve up either the

00:03:50.439 --> 00:03:52.559 line:100% position:50% align:middle
requested file name,
like style.css,

00:03:52.559 --> 00:03:57.551 line:100% position:50% align:middle
or if nothing is found, the index.html,
that's what's going to happen.

00:03:57.551 --> 00:04:04.880 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I save that, it re-uploads it for me and
now my htaccess should visit this URL and

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:08.036 line:100% position:50% align:middle
say, "Oh, there's nothing actually there.
There's no folder called

00:04:08.063 --> 00:04:15.544 line:100% position:50% align:middle
store/itchymysteriousfungi. I'm going to
serve up index.html instead." And there

00:04:15.544 --> 00:04:20.868 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it's working for me. No problem there. I
can go ahead and edit all of my content

00:04:20.868 --> 00:04:25.503 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and there's no issues with routing. So
that's with an htaccess file.

00:04:25.503 --> 00:04:30.163 line:100% position:50% align:middle
However, there also is another kind
and that is with an NGINX file.

00:04:30.163 --> 00:04:36.559 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And if you just do a quick Google for
NGINX single page app you'll see that this

00:04:36.559 --> 00:04:43.210 line:100% position:50% align:middle
is what you have to put. This goes into an
nginx.conf file and that will try the file

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:47.933 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and if not, it will always serve up
...in this case it's serving up base.html,

00:04:47.933 --> 00:04:53.322 line:100% position:50% align:middle
but you can change that to index.html, and
that will always be served to every single

00:04:53.322 --> 00:04:58.122 line:100% position:50% align:middle
URL. So you have to know a little bit
about how NGINX and all of that stuff

00:04:58.122 --> 00:05:02.815 line:100% position:50% align:middle
works, however, if you don't know what you
have, if you just have like a regular PHP

00:05:02.815 --> 00:05:08.286 line:100% position:50% align:middle
server, you probably have an Apache server
and you can create this .htaccess file and

00:05:08.286 --> 00:05:12.345 line:100% position:50% align:middle
dump this in. So that's it. That's really
all it is to deploy it to your server.

00:05:12.345 --> 00:05:14.664 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Make sure that you have this one file
and you're good to go.
