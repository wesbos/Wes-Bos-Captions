If you were to look at your application
and I asked you "what's the one thing that

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:17.150 line:100% position:50% align:middle
is really, really not jiving with you
about React?" You would probably say this,

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:21.410 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"What the hell is this?"
"this.addFish =bind(this)."

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:25.740 line:100% position:50% align:middle
All right, so we said "this" three
times, the method name twice,

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:31.140 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and then every time I have to add a method
onto here that I want to be bound to the

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.290 line:100% position:50% align:middle
instance of that component, I need to go
up to my constructor and do this whole

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:39.590 line:100% position:50% align:middle
song and dance. It probably seems like,
"that's a pain in the ass" because when we

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:42.950 line:100% position:50% align:middle
used "React Create-Class" back in the day,
it did that automatically and now we have

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:49.859 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to explicitly bind it. Now this is the
current way that we have to do it,

00:00:49.859 --> 00:00:54.087 line:100% position:50% align:middle
however, I want to take a look forward to
some of the stuff that's coming to the

00:00:54.087 --> 00:00:58.059 line:100% position:50% align:middle
language in JavaScript that's going to
make this easier. So disclaimer,

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:01.842 line:100% position:50% align:middle
none of this stuff that I'm going to be
talking about is currently in JavaScript

00:01:01.842 --> 00:01:06.375 line:100% position:50% align:middle
but we can use it in our applications
because we use something called "Babel"

00:01:06.375 --> 00:01:10.659 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and "Babel" will compile our code down to
the browser equivalent that will work in

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:15.020 line:100% position:50% align:middle
all of our browsers. So feel free to go
ahead and use this just know that this

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:20.700 line:100% position:50% align:middle
stuff is currently in stage two. There are
four stages when they are presenting ideas

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.220 line:100% position:50% align:middle
for the language and it might change, it
will change. I've been burned before when

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:30.130 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I've taught with ideas that have then
changed. But I'll try to keep this video

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:34.030 line:100% position:50% align:middle
up to date and hopefully, eventually it
will be put into language.

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.630 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We're probably looking at, I don't know, a
couple years from now.

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:43.890 line:100% position:50% align:middle
ES7 or ES2016 is already finalized so
maybe ES2017? I'm not quite sure just yet.

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.080 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So what does it do? Well, let's take this
loadSample, for an example,

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:53.130 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and let me comment out this binding here,
so we're not actually doing the binding.

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:59.360 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I'm just going to go to my application,
visit one of the stores and try to load

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.180 line:100% position:50% align:middle
some sample-fishes. Now we've commented
out loadSamples and I click that and

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:08.150 line:100% position:50% align:middle
nothing happens. Open up your dev tools in
the console and we're going to get an

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:12.780 line:100% position:50% align:middle
error here, "cannot read property
'setState' of null" Why? It's our

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:18.830 line:100% position:50% align:middle
loadSamples function says, "this.
setState" and this loadsSamples is no

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:23.770 line:100% position:50% align:middle
longer bound to the instance of that
component. So this doesn't mean that one

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:27.920 line:100% position:50% align:middle
instance of our app component. So that's
why we had to do this.

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:33.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And one thing that we can do is use what's
called a "property initializer," which

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.820 line:100% position:50% align:middle
will skip that whole binding thing. And it
looks a little something like this,

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:43.580 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we take "loadSamples" and we set it to, =
to and we set this to be an arrow function

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:49.700 line:100% position:50% align:middle
on its own. So that's similar to this,
"function" like that, but we use an arrow

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:56.190 line:100% position:50% align:middle
function so that it will not be bound to
that function but it will bound to the

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.090 line:100% position:50% align:middle
parent. That's what an arrow function
does. Check out my ES6 series if you're

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:04.020 line:100% position:50% align:middle
interested in learning more about arrow
functions. And then we put a semicolon on

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:07.340 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the end. Now that's really important. You
might see examples online without that

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:12.230 line:100% position:50% align:middle
semicolon but that was added in just
recently. Otherwise, it will break

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:15.240 line:100% position:50% align:middle
sometime down the road so make sure you
put that semicolon in.

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:21.720 line:100% position:50% align:middle
This is similar to putting a property on
an object, but in this case,

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:26.440 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we use an equal sign, set it to an actual
function, and put a semicolon on.

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:32.120 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now I save that and try to load some
fishes, and it just works.

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:36.420 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Right? Because I didn't have to do this
whole load samples and it works.

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:42.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Let's try it with another one. Let's do
"removeFish," and remove the binding.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.010 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I'm going to try to remove a fish. It will
break. You can not call fishes of

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:52.750 line:100% position:50% align:middle
undefined. We go down to our "removeFish"
and we change it to equals,

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:59.710 line:100% position:50% align:middle
this can be an arrow function here, and I
will put a semicolon on the end.

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:03.820 line:100% position:50% align:middle
The "removeFish" should work. Beautiful.
Let's do a couple more.

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:12.640 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"UpdateFish= updatedFish" semicolon on the
end. We will remove the actual binding of

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:22.230 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the "updateFish" and we should be able to
type it here and say "cool." I've updated

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:27.240 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it. No problem there. So you can go
through and change all those over and

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:31.980 line:100% position:50% align:middle
eventually be able to just delete all of
this, if you are comfortable with using a

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:37.070 line:100% position:50% align:middle
feature that probably is going to come to
JavaScript, but you can't be guaranteed

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:41.190 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that it might burn you in the future if it
changes or they take it out entirely.

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:45.880 line:100% position:50% align:middle
In a previous tutorial, I used an app,
"autobind," which is something called a

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:51.080 line:100% position:50% align:middle
decorator. It was looking good but then
they took it out and it's not looking so

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:55.880 line:100% position:50% align:middle
good anymore. So I'm not going to be
teaching with anything that's not totally

00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:01.140 line:100% position:50% align:middle
in the language. Other things we can do
with this, instead of saying "this.

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:09.790 line:100% position:50% align:middle
state" inside of our constructor, we can
take "this" out and we can simply just

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:17.220 line:100% position:50% align:middle
say, "state=fishes." Right? This is just
like adding a property to an object,

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:21.830 line:100% position:50% align:middle
except this is how you add a property
initializer, which means that every

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:27.660 line:100% position:50% align:middle
instance of this application, or of this
app component, will get its own stage.

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:31.530 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Then we have "fishes" and again a
semicolon, very important there.

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:34.430 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Let's just double check that it still
works. Then also what we can do is,

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:40.080 line:100% position:50% align:middle
let's open up our inventory. js. You can
also use this for things that you need to

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:45.280 line:100% position:50% align:middle
do after, like our prompt types. So if I
take our prompt types then delete it,

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:51.240 line:100% position:50% align:middle
then go into our component, we can say
"promptType=object" and in front of that,

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:56.110 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I'm going to say "static." And the reason
I say that is we don't need a copy of this

00:05:56.110 --> 00:06:00.170 line:100% position:50% align:middle
for every single instance. It's going to
be the same for every single instance of

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:05.040 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it so we put the word "static" in front of
it so we don't duplicate it over and over.

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:09.800 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And that should work as well. Good, still
works. What I would challenge you to do,

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:13.650 line:100% position:50% align:middle
maybe, if you're interested, is go through
all of your "this, this,

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:17.499 line:100% position:50% align:middle
this, bind this" and remove them, and try
to swap them out

00:06:17.499 --> 00:06:20.671 line:100% position:50% align:middle
with using your property initializers.
