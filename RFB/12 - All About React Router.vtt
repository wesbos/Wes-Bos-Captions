With React Router 4, there is two main
ways that you can actually change the

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:15.860 line:100% position:50% align:middle
page. And React Router 4 have sort of
taken this whole declarative route,

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:20.360 line:100% position:50% align:middle
which means that everything that you want
to do is done via a component.

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:23.980 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So, what you could do is you could render
out a redirect component.

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:27.770 line:100% position:50% align:middle
You just import that from React Router.
And you can, just say,

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:31.600 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to equals somewhere else. So, I could go
into my render method here and say,

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:37.230 line:100% position:50% align:middle
if the store has been set, like I could
set it in here and then redirect it.

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:43.290 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Otherwise, there is still an imperative
API, which will allow you to transition

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:44.640 line:100% position:50% align:middle
from one page to another.

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.820 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So, if you're looking for...you're like,
"I don't actually want a component.

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.950 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I want a function that I can run," and
that will actually change the page.

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:55.040 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So, in our case, I think it makes more
sense to use the imperative API,

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.570 line:100% position:50% align:middle
just because we already have this
goToStore function where we're pulling

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:05.790 line:100% position:50% align:middle
up the value as well as changing things on
over. So, we won't be using the redirect

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.070 line:100% position:50% align:middle
component...and that could be handy in a
lot of use cases. We are going to be

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:15.940 line:100% position:50% align:middle
using the imperative API, which is
.transitionTo. So, the way that we do

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:20.170 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that is, we first need
access to the router.

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:26.020 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And you might be asking, "Hmm, like how do
I actually access the router?" If we look

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:30.840 line:100% position:50% align:middle
at our index.js, here's the browser
router, and do we, like,

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:36.480 line:100% position:50% align:middle
import it again, and is there a method on
there? Not exactly. Because this browser

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:41.140 line:100% position:50% align:middle
router is the parent of absolutely
everything in our application,

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:47.460 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it actually is possible to surface React
Router at any component down through it.

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.240 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So, if we take a look at our dev tools
here, we go to React, we look for our

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:58.160 line:100% position:50% align:middle
StorePicker component, we click on it,
and... I don't see. There's,

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:02.680 line:100% position:50% align:middle
like, some params here, and there's, like,
a location, but there's no

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:07.210 line:100% position:50% align:middle
information...there's no method here that
allows me to change the page.

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:11.430 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And really, if you look at my page here,
I want to change the page.

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:16.590 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So, what we need to do is surface the
router, and we want to make it available

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.080 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to this component. And the way that we do
that is with something called "context" in

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:26.700 line:100% position:50% align:middle
React. So, React has "props" and "state,"
and 99% of the time,

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you're going to be either using state to
hold your data...that's our next

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.360 line:100% position:50% align:middle
video...or you're going to be using props
to pass data from one component,

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.970 line:100% position:50% align:middle
a parent, down to a child component.
However, there is sort of this third thing

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:43.020 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that's called context. And what context
allows you to do is declare something at

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:49.040 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the top level, and it will be made
available to anybody at a lower level.

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.810 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now, that may seem tempting to everyone,
because they think, "Oh,

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.540 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that's easy. I'll just put everything on
the top level, and then it's available

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:59.100 line:100% position:50% align:middle
globally." And React really doesn't want
you to do things globally,

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:02.760 line:100% position:50% align:middle
because they want you to make nice, small
components that can be modular and moved

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:03.840 line:100% position:50% align:middle
around throughout your app.

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:09.350 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So, rather than relying on a global state
for your application,

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:12.780 line:100% position:50% align:middle
they make you use state and individual
components. Again, we'll talk about that

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.700 line:100% position:50% align:middle
in the next video, if you're a little bit
confused by that. However,

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.770 line:100% position:50% align:middle
there are some things that need to be
top-level and passed down to every single

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:25.290 line:100% position:50% align:middle
one, and a router is a great example for
that. It needs to be passed down from the

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:28.840 line:100% position:50% align:middle
parent all the way down. So, how do we
actually access it? Well,

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.090 line:100% position:50% align:middle
React makes it a little bit tough to
actually do it, because, like,

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:38.890 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you need to know that you actually want to
use context. So, they're not just going to

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:43.970 line:100% position:50% align:middle
make it easy for anyone to use. Context,
otherwise, it'll start to form some bad

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:44.890 line:100% position:50% align:middle
habits.

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:48.020 line:100% position:50% align:middle
The way that we surface our router is, we
go down here, we say,

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:54.270 line:100% position:50% align:middle
StorePicker, that's our
component....contextTypes equals,

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:59.450 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and that's going to be an object. So, if
we set some context types on here, in our

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:08.250 line:100% position:50% align:middle
case, we want the router, and we will set
it to react.proptypes.object. And we're

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:14.070 line:100% position:50% align:middle
going to learn what prop types are in a
future video. But what that will then do

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:19.440 line:100% position:50% align:middle
is tell React that the StorePicker
component expects something called a

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:22.300 line:100% position:50% align:middle
router, and React will say, "Okay, I'll
make this router available to you."

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:27.200 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So, give that a save now, and watch as
this refreshes. I'm going to search for my

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:32.880 line:100% position:50% align:middle
StorePicker component again, and oh, all
of a sudden, this thing called context

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:39.320 line:100% position:50% align:middle
pops up. And open it up, there's our
router. Now, there's not a whole lot of

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:42.500 line:100% position:50% align:middle
different methods on here. That's because
almost everything in React Router is done

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:47.880 line:100% position:50% align:middle
with a component. But there is this one
called transitionTo, and that's the

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:54.420 line:100% position:50% align:middle
actual method that we need. So, we'll go
into this. Right below this comment,

00:04:54.420 --> 00:05:03.600 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we'll say, this, because this is the
actual component, .context.router,

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:09.400 line:100% position:50% align:middle
because that's the thing. And then the
method we want is called transitionTo.

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:12.790 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So let's say, transitionTo. And we want
to transition to...well,

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:17.190 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we set it right here, right?
store/...and instead of saying,

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:22.360 line:100% position:50% align:middle
storeId, how do we actually get this
value? Well, it's right here,

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:28.850 line:100% position:50% align:middle
this.storeInput.value. So maybe we'll
pop that into a variable,

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:37.340 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and we'll console log, say, "Going to
storeId," and then we'll also pop the

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:43.050 line:100% position:50% align:middle
storeID right into there. And that should
just transition us from one to another.

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:49.810 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So, give that a save. Quaint repulsive
halves, visit store, aha,

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:54.300 line:100% position:50% align:middle
awesome. Our URL has changed. One really
cool thing about React is that,

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:58.300 line:100% position:50% align:middle
since it's all client-side, it uses
something called HTML5 pushState,

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:03.020 line:100% position:50% align:middle
which you will notice that the actual page
doesn't reload itself.

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:08.790 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So, I'm right here. I click "visit store."
It will actually change the URL of your

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:13.130 line:100% position:50% align:middle
URL bar, but it actually doesn't refresh
your actual browser. And that's why it's

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:17.910 line:100% position:50% align:middle
so fast for you to go from one URL to
another, because all of the HTML,

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:21.230 line:100% position:50% align:middle
CSS, JavaScript, all of that stuff is
already loaded on the page.

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:25.400 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So,  this.context.router.transitionTo.
Pretty straightforward,

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:30.080 line:100% position:50% align:middle
just need to know that you need to surface
the router from the parent with a thing

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:32.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
called contextTypes.
