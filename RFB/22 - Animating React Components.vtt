00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:10.880 line:100% position:50% align:middle
- Now let's learn about animation in
React. And this is really nice because

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:14.090 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you can just take your existing
application and start to add some really

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:18.530 line:100% position:50% align:middle
nice interactive features into it. So
there's three animations really on this

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:22.580 line:100% position:50% align:middle
website. First is like this like cheesy
fold button where it folds itself out like

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:26.840 line:100% position:50% align:middle
an actual menu. That actually has nothing
to do with React, it's simply just a...if

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:34.110 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you look on your index.html, index.html,
there is just a fold checkbox here.

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.110 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And when that fold checkbox is checked,
if you go into style.style.

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:42.810 line:100% position:50% align:middle
By the way, this style, I never said it
earlier, but this is just like SASS or

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:46.300 line:100% position:50% align:middle
LESS, or if you've used any other
pre-processor, the really the only

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:51.470 line:100% position:50% align:middle
difference is that there's no semi-colons
or colons. Either hate it or you love it,

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:55.996 line:100% position:50% align:middle
if you like to put semi-colons and colons
in curly the brackets, you can, but I

00:00:55.996 --> 00:00:59.414 line:100% position:50% align:middle
prefer to leave them off. So what I'm
doing here is I'm just using some

00:00:59.414 --> 00:01:04.370 line:100% position:50% align:middle
rotation, rotateY, so that when it's
checked, it's going to rotate itself,

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:06.840 line:100% position:50% align:middle
when it's not checked, it's going to
rotate itself on out.

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:13.690 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So that's the rotation here, and then when
the input is not checked,

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:17.350 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I just take all the transforms off, which
is the flat state. So a little bit cheesy

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.170 line:100% position:50% align:middle
but kind of fun to take a look at a couple
times if you're a little bit overwhelmed

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:28.320 line:100% position:50% align:middle
with some of the state stuff. Then what we
want to do is we are going to be editing

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.320 line:100% position:50% align:middle
our CSS here and we need to recompile that
CSS every single time.

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:37.300 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And if you open up your package.json,
we've just been running NPM start,

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:42.230 line:100% position:50% align:middle
which NPM start will run the script
'start' and that will run our web pack and

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:44.490 line:100% position:50% align:middle
everything like that.

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:50.140 line:100% position:50% align:middle
However, we also need to run one for our
styles as well. So I have a script called

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:55.650 line:100% position:50% align:middle
styles here, and that will just run our
style list against...and I'll put it every

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:59.810 line:100% position:50% align:middle
single time that it changes. And that's
what this one is, the styles watch,

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:04.995 line:100% position:50% align:middle
there's a -w in there. However, I want to
run NPM run start and NPM run styles

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.556 line:100% position:50% align:middle
watch. And that's two separate NPM scripts
and I what I see a lot of people do is

00:02:09.556 --> 00:02:14.852 line:100% position:50% align:middle
they just open up two tabs and run both
of them. And that works well but I'm using

00:02:14.893 --> 00:02:17.040 line:100% position:50% align:middle
a third package here called concurrently.

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:22.550 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And what that's going to do is it's going
to run NPM script start and NPM script

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:26.800 line:100% position:50% align:middle
styles watch, it's going to run them at
the exact same time. And if one of them

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:31.480 line:100% position:50% align:middle
breaks, it's going to kill the other one.
So what we need to do is head back to our

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:37.970 line:100% position:50% align:middle
terminal here and we're going to kill it
with Control C. You're going to run NPM

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:44.417 line:100% position:50% align:middle
run watch. It's going to start that up for
me, and there we go. It should then open

00:02:44.417 --> 00:02:51.940 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it  up in your browser and it'll refresh,
and I'll load in sample fishes, add them

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.718 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to my order.Good, so everything is still
working. But if you go back to your

00:02:55.718 --> 00:03:00.491 line:100% position:50% align:middle
terminal, you'll see that some of them are
from web pack and then if I were to open

00:03:00.491 --> 00:03:06.130 line:100% position:50% align:middle
up my style.style and make some sort of
change, like background red,

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:13.890 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it's going to automatically compile my
SASS and re-kick everything up for me. So

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:17.380 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I'm in good shape there, you can close
that down, again, not something you will

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:21.900 line:100% position:50% align:middle
need to open up too often unless you have
an error in your style list and you'll see

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.888 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the error in your console there.

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:29.230 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Next up, what we want to do is open up
animations.style. This is where we're

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:32.470 line:100% position:50% align:middle
actually going to be writing all of our
animation code. There's nothing in there

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:38.120 line:100% position:50% align:middle
yet, but we'll be writing it all inside of
here. And then we want to open up order.js

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:46.320 line:100% position:50% align:middle
because I want to animate in this
right here, where it animates in.

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:51.070 line:100% position:50% align:middle
When you click X, it's going to animate
itself on out. And then also when we click

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:55.221 line:100% position:50% align:middle
five, six, seven, eight, I want that
number  to move up and have the next

00:03:55.221 --> 00:03:59.620 line:100% position:50% align:middle
number replace it. We're going to do
two nice animations there.

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:05.570 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So how we do that is you go to the top of
your order.js, we need to import our CSS

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:10.910 line:100% position:50% align:middle
TransitionGroup component. So that comes
from import CSS TransitionGroup from...and

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:14.540 line:100% position:50% align:middle
this is a separate package, you don't
import it from React. It used to be part

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:17.334 line:100% position:50% align:middle
of React core.
However, what they have been doing

00:04:17.334 --> 00:04:19.768 line:100% position:50% align:middle
with some of the stuff
that not everybody uses.

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:22.190 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Like not everybody is going to do
animation in the React app,

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:26.950 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the React is still maintaining them as
first class citizens, but they are in

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:34.190 line:100% position:50% align:middle
their own packages. So it's
react-dd-ons-css-transition-group.

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:35.290 line:100% position:50% align:middle
That's a long one.

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:41.350 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Then we've got the CSS TransitionGroup
component. I want you to head down to our

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:46.880 line:100% position:50% align:middle
render function. And where we have this
unordered LESS, let me give you some space

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:49.129 line:100% position:50% align:middle
here. We have this ul,
the class of order,

00:04:49.129 --> 00:04:53.980 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I want you to replace
that unordered list with CSS

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:58.600 line:100% position:50% align:middle
TransitionGroup. Now, we still want that
to be unordered list when it kicks it out

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:05.440 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to HTML. So what we can do is we give it
the property of component equals ul.

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:08.390 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So it's still going to kick out on
unordered list. The other things we

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:13.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
need, our transition name is going to be
order, and that's going to be important in

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.880 line:100% position:50% align:middle
our CSS class naming.

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:18.670 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We're going to have transition enter
timeout equals and that's the number here,

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:23.430 line:100% position:50% align:middle
so we'll use curly brackets. We want that
animation to be 500 seconds in and then we

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:30.600 line:100% position:50% align:middle
also need to provide a transition leave
time out, and that's going to also be 500

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:36.790 line:100% position:50% align:middle
milliseconds, half a second, good. So if I
look at it now, this should still be an

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:42.640 line:100% position:50% align:middle
unordered list. Yes, it is. But if I were
to look at that unordered list in my React

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:48.270 line:100% position:50% align:middle
dev tools, you see that it's a React
TransitionGroup right here.

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:52.330 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And then when I add something to it, it
should still update it,

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:55.920 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it should still add a new item, and it
should still remove that item.

00:05:55.920 --> 00:06:00.950 line:100% position:50% align:middle
You'll notice that, "Oh, look, there's a
bit of a delay there," and I'll show you

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:02.250 line:100% position:50% align:middle
why in just a second.

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:08.420 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So that is our CSS TransitionGroup. Now,
if you inspect one of these, add a whole

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:14.140 line:100% position:50% align:middle
bunch of stuff to your actual order. And I
want to change this 500.

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:20.270 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Let's change this to 5,000, that is 5
seconds. And then I want you to go and

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:25.120 line:100% position:50% align:middle
inspect one of these list items, not in
the React dev tool, just in the regular

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:30.720 line:100% position:50% align:middle
elements panel here. And when I remove
one, watch the class names on the list

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:38.870 line:100% position:50% align:middle
items. Order-leave, order-leave active and
then after five seconds it removes both of

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:39.580 line:100% position:50% align:middle
those classes.

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:45.370 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And what's happening here, and watch we'll
add a new one, jumble prawns.

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:51.560 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And watch the list item down here.
Order-enter, order-enter-active.

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:55.860 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And then after five seconds it will
remove those classes. So what's happening

00:06:55.860 --> 00:07:02.350 line:100% position:50% align:middle
here is that React is giving us some
classes which we can then hook into with

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:09.270 line:100% position:50% align:middle
our CSS. So if we go into our
animations.style and we create a class

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:15.110 line:100% position:50% align:middle
called order-enter and
order-enter-active, and I'm going to

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:24.050 line:100% position:50% align:middle
give this a background of red and this one
is going to have a background yellow.

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:28.220 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Not that refreshed. We don't have to
refresh because the CSS should be

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:29.190 line:100% position:50% align:middle
refreshed for us.

00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:33.830 line:100% position:50% align:middle
When I add a new one to our order, it
takes five seconds that will remove it

00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:38.710 line:100% position:50% align:middle
now. So when I add mussels, see yellow,
yellow, yellow, yellow,

00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:43.060 line:100% position:50% align:middle
yellow, and then after five seconds it's
going to be nothing.

00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:47.100 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And what's happening here is that it adds
a class of order-enter and then almost

00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:51.310 line:100% position:50% align:middle
immediately after it adds a class of
order-enter-active Now, if you've ever

00:07:51.310 --> 00:07:58.140 line:100% position:50% align:middle
done any CSS transitions, you'll know that
CSS needs an A point and a B point.

00:07:58.140 --> 00:08:04.630 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So in order for us to transition from
something like red to yellow,

00:08:04.630 --> 00:08:11.480 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we can pop A transition all 0.5 seconds.
And then what's going to happen is

00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:17.440 line:100% position:50% align:middle
immediately it's going to have a class of
red on it. And then over five seconds,

00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:20.866 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it's going to transition it to yellow,
watch.

00:08:24.175 --> 00:08:26.790 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Hope that will just update it, so I'm
going to remove a couple of these,

00:08:26.790 --> 00:08:30.630 line:100% position:50% align:middle
they take their five seconds to remove.
We'll talk about that in a second.

00:08:30.630 --> 00:08:34.050 line:100% position:50% align:middle
There we go. Add a lobster. It's
immediately red and then it will

00:08:34.050 --> 00:08:39.650 line:100% position:50% align:middle
transition itself to 0.5. So we need an A
point, which is order-enter, and

00:08:39.650 --> 00:08:44.210 line:100% position:50% align:middle
order-enter-active is our B point, and
it's going to go the opposite way when

00:08:44.210 --> 00:08:49.160 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we remove it. So what do we need to add
here? We have a transition of all 0.5

00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:57.590 line:100% position:50% align:middle
seconds. We are going to put a
transform: translateX(-120%).

00:08:57.590 --> 00:09:03.040 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And what that will do, is it's going to
put it off screen by default.

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:05.770 line:100% position:50% align:middle
It's going to take this unordered list and
we're going to say,

00:09:05.770 --> 00:09:09.580 line:100% position:50% align:middle
transform:translateX(-100%).

00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:17.670 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And what I just did there, is I put it off
screen. But if I bump those values up...

00:09:17.670 --> 00:09:21.600 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Here it comes, that's what's going to
happen, is it's just going to animate

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:27.720 line:100% position:50% align:middle
itself on in over that half second. So
that's why we do translateX(-120%).

00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:36.730 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We give it a max-height of zero and
that's just for some animation stuff.

00:09:36.730 --> 00:09:41.060 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And a padding of zero in...and we've got a
pop an important tag on there.

00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:46.120 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Just because of some CSS that I've done in
style, where we have a default and I need

00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:48.150 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to make sure that we're overwriting that.

00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:56.220 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Then the active spot is going to be a
max-height of 60 px, and that's why we did

00:09:56.220 --> 00:09:59.280 line:100% position:50% align:middle
a max-height here so we'll be able to
animate from nothing to 60 px.

00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:04.560 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We'll do a padding of 2em zero and pop
an important tip there.

00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:08.330 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Finally, we need to bring it back to its
regular state, so we're going to transform

00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:13.680 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it. translateX(0), right, because it's
going to start at negative 100.

00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:17.710 line:100% position:50% align:middle
It's going to start off screen, and then
it will translate it to zero, which is the

00:10:17.710 --> 00:10:21.270 line:100% position:50% align:middle
ending point. And then eventually both of
these classes will be ticked,

00:10:21.270 --> 00:10:27.400 line:100% position:50% align:middle
will be gone, and whatever styling is in
our style.style is going to kick in from

00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:29.250 line:100% position:50% align:middle
there. So give that a save.

00:10:29.250 --> 00:10:35.440 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now I try to add some lobster, mahi-mahi,
you see it's moving in.

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:39.690 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We can get rid of those classes. I just
wanted to show you how that works from

00:10:39.690 --> 00:10:43.050 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Red. It's easy to visualize it when you
have that. And then the other thing that

00:10:43.050 --> 00:10:50.230 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we can do is that we are still taking 5
seconds, not 500 milliseconds.

00:10:50.230 --> 00:10:56.030 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So let's move those back to the five
seconds and we should be good to go.

00:10:56.030 --> 00:10:59.510 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We should be able to remove them, they'll
still take half a second to remove.

00:10:59.510 --> 00:11:02.510 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Try to add them in again, good.

00:11:02.510 --> 00:11:06.630 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And you can do anything you could possibly
want with that, you can go crazy.

00:11:06.630 --> 00:11:16.450 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So I use translate but you can set like a
rotate(0). And then we want to rotate(45)

00:11:16.450 --> 00:11:28.800 line:100% position:50% align:middle
degrees, let's try that. Or you can do
450 degrees and you want to start

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:34.880 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it...actually, you should probably rotate
to 0 and from 1,000 degrees so that

00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:37.750 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it'll just spin into place like it's
Batman or something like that.

00:11:37.750 --> 00:11:46.525 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So let me remove these, that's kind of
fun. You can do all kinds crazy stuff with

00:11:46.525 --> 00:11:49.330 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it but don't make your users vomit
or anything like that.

00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:53.720 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I'm going to leave mine at translateX and
we're going to look at how do we do the

00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:58.460 line:100% position:50% align:middle
other way, which is order-leave. Because
you'll notice that when I remove one of

00:11:58.460 --> 00:12:02.480 line:100% position:50% align:middle
these, it says, "Order-leave and
order-leave-active." So we're going to

00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:07.320 line:100% position:50% align:middle
give ourselves two more classes.
And when the order is leaving,

00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:13.150 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we are going to transition all 0.5s, that
you should make sure that that 5 seconds,

00:12:13.150 --> 00:12:19.610 line:100% position:50% align:middle
or half a second, lines up with whatever
you have right here. And we also want to

00:12:19.610 --> 00:12:25.140 line:100% position:50% align:middle
transform... We want to start it at
translateX(0), so we want to...the

00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:28.130 line:100% position:50% align:middle
starting point is just
going to be where it is.

00:12:28.130 --> 00:12:33.620 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And then the active state is going to be
go to the right. So we're going to say,

00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:42.240 line:100% position:50% align:middle
transform: translateX(120%). We get a
max-height of zero. We're pretty much

00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:46.560 line:100% position:50% align:middle
doing the opposite of what we did earlier,
padding is going to be zero.

00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:52.270 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And that should do it. So I'm going to
remove them, yes. Nice little animation

00:12:52.270 --> 00:12:57.808 line:100% position:50% align:middle
out. We are transitioning on the
translateX value, the height value as well

00:12:57.808 --> 00:13:01.450 line:100% position:50% align:middle
as the padding. And if you're wondering
why I'm using max-height and not height,

00:13:01.450 --> 00:13:07.120 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it's because you cannot transition from
auto height, which is what they are, to a

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:10.850 line:100% position:50% align:middle
fixed height, you need to use max-height.
It's a bit of a trick that we do there.

00:13:10.850 --> 00:13:16.140 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So that is those elements, now let's work
on the secondary animation that we have

00:13:16.140 --> 00:13:19.830 line:100% position:50% align:middle
here, which is a little bit different,
and we're going to animate this number.

00:13:19.830 --> 00:13:26.407 line:100% position:50% align:middle
When we add more mussels, the three should
go up and the four should come in from

00:13:26.407 --> 00:13:31.065 line:100% position:50% align:middle
underneath it. To work with the count,
this is the value that we are going to be

00:13:31.065 --> 00:13:33.236 line:100% position:50% align:middle
animating. And in order
for it to actually work,

00:13:33.236 --> 00:13:36.740 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we need multiple ones
of that actual value.

00:13:36.740 --> 00:13:40.590 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So a couple things we need to do here,
first, put these spans that you have

00:13:40.590 --> 00:13:44.370 line:100% position:50% align:middle
wrapped around everything, put them on
their own line. Second,

00:13:44.370 --> 00:13:50.310 line:100% position:50% align:middle
put the LBS fish name and remove button,
put them on their own line.

00:13:50.310 --> 00:13:56.490 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And then we need to take this count here
and wrap it in a CSS TransitionGroups.

00:13:56.490 --> 00:14:02.190 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So I'm just going to take the name here,
CSS TransitionGroup, we'll put the count

00:14:02.190 --> 00:14:07.500 line:100% position:50% align:middle
inside of that. And then finally, we need
to wrap this in another span, and I'm

00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:11.890 line:100% position:50% align:middle
show you why in just a second. I'm not
crazy, wrap it in a span.

00:14:11.890 --> 00:14:18.230 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And that span needs to have a key which is
of count. And the reason it's count is

00:14:18.230 --> 00:14:22.420 line:100% position:50% align:middle
because every time you have a key of two
elements that are beside each other,

00:14:22.420 --> 00:14:26.100 line:100% position:50% align:middle
they need to have a unique key and they
have to be different than each other.

00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:29.820 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And the reason is, is if we're going to
have a span with like a five in it, and

00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:33.710 line:100% position:50% align:middle
then when we increment that by one, we're
going to have a span with a six in it.

00:14:33.710 --> 00:14:38.570 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And what React is going to do, is it's
going to duplicate the first five span and

00:14:38.570 --> 00:14:42.600 line:100% position:50% align:middle
update it with the six. But it's not going
to get rid of the original span right

00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:46.280 line:100% position:50% align:middle
away, it's going to give us 250
milliseconds, half a second, however long

00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:52.250 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we ask it to, to animate 5 up and then we
animate 5 into the spot where it was,

00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:56.620 line:100% position:50% align:middle
right. So that's why we need to have a key
in here is so that React will know which

00:14:56.620 --> 00:15:01.740 line:100% position:50% align:middle
one to add a class of leaving and which
one to add a class of entering or

00:15:01.740 --> 00:15:07.060 line:100% position:50% align:middle
order-active...or order-active-leave and
order-active-enter. So that's why we have

00:15:07.060 --> 00:15:07.650 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that there.

00:15:07.650 --> 00:15:11.780 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Our TransitionGroup needs a couple more
things, we first need the component, which

00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:17.730 line:100% position:50% align:middle
is going to be a span in itself. We need a
class name, which is going to be count.

00:15:17.730 --> 00:15:24.030 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We need a transition name on it, it's
going to be count. And then we need a

00:15:24.030 --> 00:15:31.300 line:100% position:50% align:middle
transition enter timeout and that is going
to be equal to 250 milliseconds.

00:15:31.300 --> 00:15:38.310 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And then we also want a leave time out.
Now, if that all worked,

00:15:38.310 --> 00:15:41.910 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we should see not any animation yet, we've
not written in the CSS,

00:15:41.910 --> 00:15:46.070 line:100% position:50% align:middle
but we should see this two being
duplicated for...just a second.

00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:52.720 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So Pacific halibut, so three two, four two
five, four, etc. See how it's like

00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:56.950 line:100% position:50% align:middle
duplicating it really quickly? We inspect
that and go to the span right here,

00:15:56.950 --> 00:16:00.100 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I'll push the button, you keep your eyes
down here. And I click it,

00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:07.600 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you see how it duplicated those values for
us? If we change this to maybe two and a

00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:12.960 line:100% position:50% align:middle
half seconds, it'll slow down and we'll be
able to understand what's going on here.

00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:19.810 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we've got this span of 12. I'm going to
add it again. Thirteen,

00:16:19.810 --> 00:16:26.050 line:100% position:50% align:middle
see enter-leave. I'll do it again.
Enter-active, leave-active.

00:16:26.050 --> 00:16:30.460 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we've got these two spans now because
React is smart enough to duplicate it for

00:16:30.460 --> 00:16:36.840 line:100% position:50% align:middle
us. And then it's up to us to take that
first one or the one of the 15 and animate

00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:41.740 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it up. And take the second one, which is a
16 and made it into the place where we had

00:16:41.740 --> 00:16:41.870 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it.

00:16:41.870 --> 00:16:47.510 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we'll head back to our animations here
and we need a whole bunch of selector.

00:16:47.510 --> 00:16:57.170 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We need a .count-enter and a
.count-enter-active. Here we're going to

00:16:57.170 --> 00:17:02.140 line:100% position:50% align:middle
transition everything all over 2.5
seconds. Let's do it really slowly and

00:17:02.140 --> 00:17:08.680 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we'll move it back to 250 milliseconds.
transform: translateY.

00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:12.750 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Because we're going to be going on up and
down axis, this time 100%.

00:17:12.750 --> 00:17:17.380 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we're going to start it just off the
screen when something is entering.

00:17:17.380 --> 00:17:26.669 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we're going to take this, I'm going to
say, transform: translateY(100%).

00:17:27.179 --> 00:17:31.100 line:100% position:50% align:middle
What that does, see it's gone. You can't
see the four, but it's going to slowly

00:17:31.100 --> 00:17:36.890 line:100% position:50% align:middle
bring us into the actual field. See, there
it is, that's what's going to happen and

00:17:36.890 --> 00:17:40.360 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we're going to do the opposite. We're
going to do the opposite with the other

00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:48.030 line:100% position:50% align:middle
one and made it up. So translateY(100),
start it off screen, and then when it's

00:17:48.030 --> 00:17:55.030 line:100% position:50% align:middle
active, we're simply just going to
transform zero. That means just put it in

00:17:55.030 --> 00:18:03.410 line:100% position:50% align:middle
its normal resting spot. All right, so
let's see what we've got here,

00:18:03.410 --> 00:18:09.360 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we've still got this, transform on it. If
I add another one, you see what's

00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:13.440 line:100% position:50% align:middle
happening? If I add a whole bunch of them,
they all animate themselves in on out.

00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:18.880 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And then after two and a half seconds, the
old one will just remove itself.

00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:21.780 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Because React wants to give us that two
and a half seconds, actually,

00:18:21.780 --> 00:18:25.090 line:100% position:50% align:middle
animated out, and then behind the scenes
it's going to clean it up and actually

00:18:25.090 --> 00:18:32.030 line:100% position:50% align:middle
delete that DOM element for us. So that's
when we need to have a count-leave and a

00:18:32.030 --> 00:18:43.010 line:100% position:50% align:middle
count-leave-active. Then we are going to
say, "Transition all .5...we'll do,

00:18:43.010 --> 00:18:48.450 line:100% position:50% align:middle
2.5 seconds. We're going to make it
position absolute because you'll notice

00:18:48.450 --> 00:18:52.380 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that they're just going next to each other
right now and we need to have one of them

00:18:52.380 --> 00:18:54.310 line:100% position:50% align:middle
overlap the other actual number.

00:18:54.310 --> 00:19:01.224 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So position absolute, left, 0, bottom, 0
and transform is going to be

00:19:01.224 --> 00:19:09.150 line:100% position:50% align:middle
translateY(0). We're going to start it
where it is, right? Just we want to start

00:19:09.150 --> 00:19:13.400 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it. If we're getting rid of four here,
when we add another one, we want to start

00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:22.165 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it at 0 and we want to animate it up -100%
so we transform: translateY(100%).

00:19:23.853 --> 00:19:28.830 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Okay, that was a lot of CSS,
but let's see if I when add it,

00:19:28.830 --> 00:19:37.180 line:100% position:50% align:middle
pump that right up. You see what's
going on here, 34, 35, 36.

00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:43.930 line:100% position:50% align:middle
One of them animates itself up,
the other one animates itself on in.

00:19:43.930 --> 00:19:49.060 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So that's really long, we'll take that 2.5
seconds and make it .25 seconds.

00:19:49.060 --> 00:19:55.190 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And then we'll go back to our order here
and make it 250 milliseconds instead.

00:19:55.190 --> 00:20:02.630 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So that should be nice and quick. Here we
go. So that is the two ways that you do

00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:08.590 line:100% position:50% align:middle
animations. First of all, when it's coming
in, we can animate it from its original

00:20:08.590 --> 00:20:13.990 line:100% position:50% align:middle
state, order-enter into the state where we
want it. And then sometimes we'll have the

00:20:13.990 --> 00:20:18.160 line:100% position:50% align:middle
case where we're just duplicating things,
and that's where React will duplicate that

00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:23.160 line:100% position:50% align:middle
element, let you animate the old one out
while you're animating the new one in. And

00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:27.770 line:100% position:50% align:middle
at that point it's just CSS, there's no
real extra stuff that happens in React

00:20:27.770 --> 00:20:28.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
there.
