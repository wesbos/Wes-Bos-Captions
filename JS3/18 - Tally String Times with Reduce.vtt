00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.371 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Today we're going to be
solving a problem that I actually run into

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:16.840 line:100% position:50% align:middle
fairly frequently, and that is I want to
add up the total number of minutes,

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:22.470 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and seconds, and hours that is my actual
videos. So what I usually do is I'll

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.810 line:100% position:50% align:middle
export all my videos and I'll upload them
to Youtube or whatever it is my host and

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:30.530 line:100% position:50% align:middle
they'll give me like this time stamp here,
5 minutes and 23 seconds.

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:35.380 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And I go, "Uh huh. I need to
add that up all together," right?

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:40.830 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And it's just in HTML. So what I've done,
is I've sort of replicated what Youtube

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:45.330 line:100% position:50% align:middle
generally gives me. They have like a list
item or a div, or something like that.

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:49.650 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And there's going to be some sort of a dom
node that it's either like a span with a

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:55.120 line:100% position:50% align:middle
class of time and inside of that it'll say
2 minutes and 34 seconds or usually with

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:00.200 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Youtube they have a data-time attribute
that is a string containing the minutes

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:04.410 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and the seconds of it.
So what I wanted to do is to figure out

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:09.640 line:100% position:50% align:middle
how do I pull these out of the dom,
convert them to numbers, make them into

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.280 line:100% position:50% align:middle
minutes and seconds, add it all up,
figure out how many hours,

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.020 line:100% position:50% align:middle
minutes and seconds there are totally,
then finally console.log those actual

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:24.630 line:100% position:50% align:middle
values. So we are going to be using reduce
in this one and I'm going to show you

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.870 line:100% position:50% align:middle
how to first do it with map and reduce,
and then we'll look at how do you just

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:33.360 line:100% position:50% align:middle
make it in one single reduce. So
we're going to our script tag here and I'm

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.360 line:100% position:50% align:middle
just going to open this up. There's not
much to look at for this one.

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.780 line:100% position:50% align:middle
It's kind of ugly but we're really just
concerned with this data-time attributes

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.580 line:100% position:50% align:middle
here. So first thing that we want to do is
we want to select all of those nodes.

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:50.350 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we're going to say const time nodes
equals document.queryselectorall.

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.450 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We're going to be looking at not just a
list item because you don't know if it's

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.240 line:100% position:50% align:middle
just going to be a list item. We want to
say anything with a data-time attribute on

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:06.320 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it. Now let's console log those
time nodes. Okay, we've got a bunch of

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.640 line:100% position:50% align:middle
list items. Now what I want
to do is I want to turn

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:17.830 line:100% position:50% align:middle
this from a node list into an array of
actual time strings. Let's just say

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:26.640 line:100% position:50% align:middle
seconds equals timenodes.map and for each
one, we are going to take the node and

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:32.025 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we're going to return to the
node.dataset.time. So watch what's going

00:02:32.025 --> 00:02:38.680 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to air out in here. Timenodes.map is not a
function. So map is not a function of time

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:44.400 line:100% position:50% align:middle
nodes. Why is that? I thought it
was an array. Let's see it again.

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:50.780 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Time nodes is looks like an array, walks
like an array, but it's not.

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.280 line:100% position:50% align:middle
It's a nodeless and if you open up the
product type we do not have.

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.010 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We have it for each which we could use but
it's not as clean. So what we want to do

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.450 line:100% position:50% align:middle
is convert this sucker from
a nodeless into an array.

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:06.470 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And there are two ways. You could spread
it it into a new array or you can run

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:13.930 line:100% position:50% align:middle
array.from round the entire thing.
And now when we loop over it,

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:19.940 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we should have our seconds variable which
is now going to be an array of all of the

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:25.250 line:100% position:50% align:middle
times. Good. So what I did there is I took
the time nodes and I mapped it which means

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:30.180 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I made it from an array of list items
and into an array of strings.

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:35.460 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Good. Now what I want
to do is turn that into

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:43.200 line:100% position:50% align:middle
just seconds, okay? So we're going to
.map it into that and that is going to

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:50.220 line:100% position:50% align:middle
give us the time code. And from that we
are going to split it because if we have a

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:54.860 line:100% position:50% align:middle
string like this, I want to break that
into minutes and seconds.

00:03:54.860 --> 00:04:00.700 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Let me show you an example here, right?
Might say something like string.split

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:04.580 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and we split it on the colon
and that will give us,

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:07.580 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the first thing is going to be the
minutes. The second thing will be the

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:11.050 line:100% position:50% align:middle
seconds. So what we can do is we can use
ES6 restructuring there

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:22.720 line:100% position:50% align:middle
which they say const, mins, secs is equal
to timecode.split. Then I'll split it on

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:26.260 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that. Okay. Let's see where that gets us.
We want the console log,

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:32.332 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the min, and the secs. And you see
that we've got a 5, 43, 2, okay.

00:04:32.332 --> 00:04:36.310 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We're good. We've got them into
their own variables however they are

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:41.210 line:100% position:50% align:middle
black, and what that tells me is that they
are strings. And if we want to do any sort

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:45.170 line:100% position:50% align:middle
of math because what we are going to be
doing here is we're going to return the

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:52.880 line:100% position:50% align:middle
mins plus the minutes times sixty, plus
the seconds. And if we take a look at our

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:57.480 line:100% position:50% align:middle
seconds array here, you'll see that these
are way bigger than they should be.

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:01.780 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Zero, four, seven. That's not a number.
And that's because when we split

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:08.610 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that string off of it, it's still going to
be a string. So if I take something like a

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:16.470 line:100% position:50% align:middle
string of six ten and I split it, each of
the six and the ten are still strings.

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:21.350 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So what can we do? We could just map over
that array real quick and you could pass

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:26.790 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it. Parse float. And what that will do is
it's going to run the parse float function

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:31.280 line:100% position:50% align:middle
against every item in the result array.
And that's going to return to us

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:37.390 line:100% position:50% align:middle
an actual array of numbers. So we're
going to split then right away map that

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:43.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
into parse float. And that's the same
thing as doing this function,

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:50.430 line:100% position:50% align:middle
stir and then returning parse float stir
but because we're just running this,

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:54.850 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it doesn't make sense to run a function.
You can just pass at the function directly

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:59.170 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and it will call that function against
every item in that array.

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:03.581 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Good. So what have we got here?
Let's look at our seconds. Good.

00:06:03.581 --> 00:06:07.585 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We've got an array of seconds.
The first one is 343 seconds.

00:06:07.585 --> 00:06:12.530 line:100% position:50% align:middle
The second one is 47 seconds.
Let's double check that right here.

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:17.960 line:100% position:50% align:middle
The first one is that. It looks good. The
fourth one is 47 seconds.

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:22.440 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Good. So our numbers are all adding up.
Now we want to add them together.

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:26.840 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So how would I do that? Well, reduce is a
really good way. So if map takes in an

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:32.640 line:100% position:50% align:middle
array and exports an array, a reduce
will take in an array and return

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:36.530 line:100% position:50% align:middle
anything you want. It could be
a number, it could be a string,

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:40.080 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it could be an object. In our case, we are
going to take all of these numbers and

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:46.380 line:100% position:50% align:middle
reduce them down into one big number. So
we'll call .reduce and that will give us

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:57.228 line:100% position:50% align:middle
each, we'll call that a total in seconds.
And from that, we're going to return

00:06:57.228 --> 00:07:02.648 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the total plus the seconds.
And of course we can make that

00:07:02.648 --> 00:07:09.070 line:100% position:50% align:middle
a nice little tidy arrow function. We just
do it in one line. So by the way these

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:12.980 line:100% position:50% align:middle
seconds is not the same as the seconds. If
you wanted to rename that to something

00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:18.700 line:100% position:50% align:middle
like vidseconds just so you
don't confuse yourself, go for it.

00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:22.430 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Good. Now let's see what our main
seconds variables at. Okay good.

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:27.200 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We've got the total number of seconds for
every single video added together.

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:30.790 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Good, I'm nice and happy with that.
Now what we need to do with this

00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:34.760 line:100% position:50% align:middle
seconds variable here is we need to chop
it down into hours, minutes,

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:38.219 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and seconds. So I'm going to create a
variable that's sort of going to be a

00:07:38.219 --> 00:07:42.140 line:100% position:50% align:middle
running tally of seconds left. Because
we're just start chipping away

00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:46.049 line:100% position:50% align:middle
at the hours and minutes and seconds.
So we'll say let seconds left

00:07:46.049 --> 00:07:54.112 line:100% position:50% align:middle
equals seconds. Then we make our hours,
is going to be equal to...

00:07:54.112 --> 00:08:04.355 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Normally we do something like this seconds
left divided by 3600 and what that will do

00:08:04.355 --> 00:08:10.235 line:100% position:50% align:middle
if I save it, look at how many hours we
have. We have 4.9 hours. But we don't care

00:08:10.235 --> 00:08:13.954 line:100% position:50% align:middle
about the point nine so what we can
do is we can just grab the lower limit

00:08:13.954 --> 00:08:17.416 line:100% position:50% align:middle
of that. We only care about whole
hours. The point nine is going to make

00:08:17.416 --> 00:08:24.960 line:100% position:50% align:middle
itself into seconds and minutes. Wrap it
in math.floor and that's going to tell us

00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:33.324 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that we have four whole hours.
Now seconds left is equal to, how do we

00:08:33.324 --> 00:08:37.430 line:100% position:50% align:middle
figure that out? It was like point 9 so
does that mean there was like 90 seconds

00:08:37.430 --> 00:08:43.370 line:100% position:50% align:middle
left? No it doesn't...because math is
100 based and minutes are 60 based,

00:08:43.370 --> 00:08:48.731 line:100% position:50% align:middle
so how do we figure that out? Well what we
can do is we take the seconds left and we

00:08:48.731 --> 00:08:57.084 line:100% position:50% align:middle
use mod 3600. Now what does mod do?
Let's do a little quick side lesson.

00:08:57.084 --> 00:09:01.406 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I've got a box of Smarties and in
that box I have 10 smarties.

00:09:01.406 --> 00:09:06.532 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now I have five children so I'm
going to divide that by five.

00:09:06.532 --> 00:09:10.705 line:100% position:50% align:middle
How many Smarties does each kid
have? Two. Every kid gets two Smarties.

00:09:10.705 --> 00:09:16.689 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Good. But what if I open up a box and lo
and behold there was 11 Smarties?

00:09:16.689 --> 00:09:20.549 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Well there's only five kids so how many
Smarties does each kid get?

00:09:20.549 --> 00:09:24.939 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Two point two smarties? There's no way
you're going to...oh by the way,

00:09:24.939 --> 00:09:30.078 line:100% position:50% align:middle
if you're not Canadian, a Smartie is like
an M&amp;M. It's a little chocolate treat.

00:09:30.078 --> 00:09:34.539 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So there's no way you're going
to cut a little Smartie up into

00:09:34.539 --> 00:09:39.711 line:100% position:50% align:middle
point two pieces. So what we're only
concerned with is how many whole Smarties

00:09:39.711 --> 00:09:45.572 line:100% position:50% align:middle
is each kid going to get math.floor. So
each kid is going to get two whole

00:09:45.572 --> 00:09:48.978 line:100% position:50% align:middle
smarties, good but now what we want to
know and that's what we've done right here

00:09:48.978 --> 00:09:53.182 line:100% position:50% align:middle
but now what we want to do is we want to
figure out how many Smarties are left for

00:09:53.182 --> 00:09:58.546 line:100% position:50% align:middle
dad because I get to eat whatever cannot
be evenly distributed between all the kids

00:09:58.546 --> 00:10:05.600 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So what we have is 11 Smarties mod 5,
and that's going to return to us one.

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:11.299 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Why one? Because what mod does
is it says, "How many are left after

00:10:11.299 --> 00:10:15.962 line:100% position:50% align:middle
they've been evenly distributed?"
So after each kid gets two,

00:10:15.962 --> 00:10:21.836 line:100% position:50% align:middle
there's going to be one left. Same thing
if I have five oranges and I divide them

00:10:21.836 --> 00:10:28.285 line:100% position:50% align:middle
by two kids. There's going to
be one left because it doesn't tell us,

00:10:28.285 --> 00:10:36.394 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and let's do a seconds example,
if I have 73 seconds and I divide that by

00:10:36.394 --> 00:10:44.387 line:100% position:50% align:middle
60 seconds, we clearly have 1 whole minute
math.floor shows us 1 whole minute but

00:10:44.387 --> 00:10:49.776 line:100% position:50% align:middle
what does that point two seconds? That's
not twenty seconds because that's a

00:10:49.776 --> 00:10:59.793 line:100% position:50% align:middle
percentage. So 73 mod 60 will tell us that
after we chunk it out into 1 whole minute,

00:10:59.793 --> 00:11:03.371 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we have 13 seconds left. That's
exactly what we're doing here.

00:11:03.371 --> 00:11:08.224 line:100% position:50% align:middle
After we chunk it into the hours, we are
going to have these many seconds left.

00:11:08.224 --> 00:11:15.393 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So let's console log seconds
left. Seconds, there we go.

00:11:15.393 --> 00:11:22.091 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we have 3538 seconds left. So we can go
ahead and do minutes now, const mins

00:11:22.091 --> 00:11:28.009 line:100% position:50% align:middle
equals, we'll do the same thing math.floor
take the seconds left and we'll divide

00:11:28.009 --> 00:11:32.580 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that by 60 because there are 60 seconds in
a minute, then we update our seconds left

00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:37.688 line:100% position:50% align:middle
variable just like we did here but instead
we use 60. And this is why I used led up

00:11:37.688 --> 00:11:42.281 line:100% position:50% align:middle
here because we need to reassign this
value over and over. So console log hours

00:11:42.281 --> 00:11:48.809 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and minutes. 4 hours, 58 minutes and then
we can just use the seconds left because

00:11:48.809 --> 00:11:51.669 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that's what's left at the end of the day.
There's no need to convert it.

00:11:51.669 --> 00:11:56.598 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we have our seconds left variable. So 4
hours, 58 minutes, and 58 seconds.

00:11:56.598 --> 00:12:00.804 line:100% position:50% align:middle
You can test that. You can take this one
that's 404 and change it to 406.

00:12:00.804 --> 00:12:06.549 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And if you refresh, it will show you
4 hours, 59 minutes, and 0 seconds left.

00:12:06.549 --> 00:12:12.857 line:100% position:50% align:middle
That's how I would do it. Also I've
done this into map and reduce.

00:12:12.857 --> 00:12:17.334 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Just so I can show you what we're doing
in every step of the time but if you

00:12:17.334 --> 00:12:21.518 line:100% position:50% align:middle
really understand what's going on here,
this could be all done in a single reduce.

00:12:21.518 --> 00:12:29.208 line:100% position:50% align:middle
You've taken this array of nodes. You
convert the dataset.time into minutes and

00:12:29.208 --> 00:12:34.215 line:100% position:50% align:middle
seconds. You convert that, then
into seconds then you convert that into

00:12:34.215 --> 00:12:37.494 line:100% position:50% align:middle
whole number of seconds where they have
the number, and then finally add it all

00:12:37.494 --> 00:12:41.521 line:100% position:50% align:middle
together. So it's up to you whether you do
it in one shot or make it a little bit

00:12:41.521 --> 00:12:45.411 line:100% position:50% align:middle
more readable and chunk it into separate
ones. And that allows you to write little

00:12:45.411 --> 00:12:49.765 line:100% position:50% align:middle
comments above each of them. Hopefully you
enjoyed that. I will see you tomorrow.
