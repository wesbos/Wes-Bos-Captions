00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:11.390 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Hello. Hello. Hello. Today, we are going
to be learning about two main things.

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:13.960 line:100% position:50% align:middle
First, we're going to be learning about
local storage and, second,

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:17.400 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we're going to be learning about something
called "event delegation".

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.180 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So what we've got here is sort of a
[tapas] menu, where you can add things,

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.330 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and then if you want them you can check
and uncheck them. But kind of the cool

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:30.330 line:100% position:50% align:middle
thing, where if you were to type in like
"taco", I'm going to say "pork taco",

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:36.230 line:100% position:50% align:middle
hit Enter, and then when I refresh the
page it's still there. If I click on one

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:40.190 line:100% position:50% align:middle
of them to taco it or check it, as normal
people would do, you refresh,

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.630 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it's still going to be there. So that's
going to be persisting our state with

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:48.960 line:100% position:50% align:middle
local storage. Next up, we're also going
to be doing something called "event

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:55.310 line:100% position:50% align:middle
delegation", because when I add another
item here, like fish, and I click on it,

00:00:55.310 --> 00:01:00.150 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I can taco it right away. Why can I do
that? Because if you add an event listener

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:05.520 line:100% position:50% align:middle
on something that doesn't exist, you'll
know that in the future it won't be

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:10.280 line:100% position:50% align:middle
clicked. So we're going to look at that
error as well, and use event delegation to

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:15.450 line:100% position:50% align:middle
fix it. So I've gone ahead and just
selected the Add Items, which in our case

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.340 line:100% position:50% align:middle
is this form element right here. So when
someone submits that form,

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.630 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we're going to add an item. Then, I have
also selected this UL with a class of

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:28.120 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"plates" here. That's where we're going to
load all of our tapas dishes into.

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:31.810 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Then, finally, we're going to be storing
all of our data in an array.

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:36.270 line:100% position:50% align:middle
It's going to be an array of objects,
which has the name of the array,

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.990 line:100% position:50% align:middle
as well as the status whether it's tacoed
or done, or whatever it is that we are

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:45.890 line:100% position:50% align:middle
here. So we're going to go ahead and grab
that form element, which is Add Items,

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:50.510 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and we're going to listen for the submit
event. Why do we listen for the submit

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:54.210 line:100% position:50% align:middle
event here? Because that's what we
actually need. A lot of times people,

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.670 line:100% position:50% align:middle
they listen for a click on this button.
But you want to listen for a submit,

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.900 line:100% position:50% align:middle
when someone hits Enter, when someone
clicks a button, when some external thing

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:06.040 line:100% position:50% align:middle
submits it. We need to make sure that we
are covering all our bases,

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:14.080 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and by listening to the submit event, we
cover all of our bases with that.

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:19.070 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we're going to run a function called
"addItem" when somebody submits it,

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:23.260 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and we're going to create that function
here. It's going to give us the event,

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:28.730 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and let's just console.log, "Hello". I'm
going to open mine up here,

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:34.910 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and I'm going to go to the console here.
Now, when I type in something like "fish,"

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:39.660 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you see that, oh, "Hello" is quickly
flashed there. Let me do it again.

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.750 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Oh, if you click on this button here,
Preserve Log, you can see what's happening

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:50.060 line:100% position:50% align:middle
here. I'm going to hit Enter, and then
automatically we log "Hello",

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.660 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and then we see "Navigated to" and this is
the URLs of where I'm working here.

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.490 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So what's happening is our page is
actually refreshing, and we don't want

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:03.240 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that. So what we can do is we can say
e.preventDefault, and that's going to stop

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:07.080 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the page from reloading. Because by
default, a form is just going to reload

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:12.300 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the page or send the data to an external
source, generally what's your server side.

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:16.320 line:100% position:50% align:middle
In this case, we're going to be doing an
all client side, so prevent the default of

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:23.550 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that happening. Now when I type in
something and submit that, we don't get

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:28.960 line:100% position:50% align:middle
anything. Why is that? Because nothing is
happening. If I were to console.log

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:35.550 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"hello," once more, I'm going to say
"hello," we see "hello" in the thing but

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:41.920 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the page does not reload. Okay. Now that
we have that, what we need to do is to

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:48.920 line:100% position:50% align:middle
take that text of this box and put it into
an object. So first of all,

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:53.730 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we are going to make an item and that item
is going to have two.

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:57.990 line:100% position:50% align:middle
It's going to have text of item name, and
we'll replace that in a second.

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:01.430 line:100% position:50% align:middle
It's going to have a done state of
"false". So by default, it's not going to

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:05.510 line:100% position:50% align:middle
be checked or tacoed. Now, how do we get
this text here? Well,

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:13.880 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we can do this, "const text =" and we're
going to first grab this input box,

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:19.820 line:100% position:50% align:middle
which has a name of item on it. So we
could say "document.querySelector"

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:27.440 line:100% position:50% align:middle
but we can also do "this.querySelector."
Why can we do that? "Name=item"

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:32.360 line:100% position:50% align:middle
why can we do that? That's because this is
going to be the actual form.

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:36.770 line:100% position:50% align:middle
That's the whole form tag, and then we'll
look inside of that form tag for something

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:41.870 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that has a name attribute of "Item".
That's really helpful if you have multiple

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:45.060 line:100% position:50% align:middle
forms on a page. You don't just want to be
globally selecting it.

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:49.380 line:100% position:50% align:middle
You want to narrow down your search inside
of the one form that we're working with.

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:53.770 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we've got that text. If we were just to
wrap that whole thing in parentheses,

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:57.270 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it's going to execute first and we can
call ".value" against it.

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:00.290 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Because that's going to give us the input,
and then input has a property called

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:05.070 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"value," which is whatever the user has
typed into it. Then, we can go here.

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:09.320 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Type "text." Or if you've watched my ES6
videos, then you know instead of saying

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:15.780 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"text: text," we can use the ES6 shorthand
property, which is just "text".

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:20.770 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we just created this object here. Let's
console.log the item.

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:24.410 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Let's go over to our console. Let's type
in something like "fish."

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:28.920 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now, when I run that, you should now
see an object in your console that has a

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:33.010 line:100% position:50% align:middle
done of "false" and a text of whatever the
user has put in there.

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:35.850 line:100% position:50% align:middle
If you run it a couple times, you're going
to get it console logged.

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:39.740 line:100% position:50% align:middle
One thing we want to do is clear that
input. What we can do is we can say

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:45.280 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"this.reset." Because "this" is the form
element, and form elements have a method

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:49.760 line:100% position:50% align:middle
called "reset" on it. You've probably run
into this where you've spent an hour

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:53.610 line:100% position:50% align:middle
filling out a form online somewhere, and
you accidentally click the Reset button

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:59.110 line:100% position:50% align:middle
instead of the Submit button. That's what
it's hooked up to is the ".reset."

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:05.210 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So let's see where we're at now. "Fish,"
there we go. It refreshes it,

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:08.930 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it clears that, and we create this object.
We're not seeing it,

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:14.860 line:100% position:50% align:middle
because we're not console logging it. Now,
what we want to do is take that item here

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:19.290 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and put that into this item's array. So
what we do is we just say

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:27.950 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"items.push(item)." Now, let's take a fish
and we will say "squid."

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:32.690 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now, if we look at our item's array, you
see that we have "Object" with two things

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:37.750 line:100% position:50% align:middle
in it. We can go one step further and
console.table the item's array,

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:42.750 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and you see that we have "Fish" and
"Squid". Now, that's all we've done to get

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:46.760 line:100% position:50% align:middle
our data in it. It's not going to persist
when we refresh just yet.

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:50.380 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We'll do that in just a second. But at
this point, we need to create a second

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:54.450 line:100% position:50% align:middle
function that we're going to call
"populateList," and that's going to create

00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:58.190 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the actual HTML here. So we're going to
say "function populateList".

00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:04.650 line:100% position:50% align:middle
That populateList function needs two
things. First of all, it needs a list of

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:08.660 line:100% position:50% align:middle
plates to populate. We've stored that
where? We've stored that in our item's

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:13.340 line:100% position:50% align:middle
array. Let me show you once more. If I
type "fish" and look at our item's array,

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:17.730 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you see that we have an array of things,
which has a text of "fish" and done.

00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:22.390 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we need to pass in what that's going to
be called, and you can call that "Items"

00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:27.050 line:100% position:50% align:middle
if you prefer to name the variable the
same thing. But let's call that "plates"

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:31.620 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and we're going to set that to be a
default of an empty object.

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:36.170 line:100% position:50% align:middle
The reason why I do that is because if for
some reason you forget to pass in

00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:39.900 line:100% position:50% align:middle
something, it's not going to break your
JavaScript. It's just going to loop over

00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:44.410 line:100% position:50% align:middle
an array of nothing, and then your map
function will work just fine.

00:07:44.410 --> 00:07:49.420 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Then, second of all, we need a place to
put the HTML and that's called the "plates

00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:55.280 line:100% position:50% align:middle
list." We are going to pass in our items
list. So why am I doing that?

00:07:55.280 --> 00:08:00.250 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Why am I not just like reaching outside
and grabbing the list of items and

00:08:00.250 --> 00:08:03.840 line:100% position:50% align:middle
grabbing the place where we will dump
them? That's because I want this

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:08.780 line:100% position:50% align:middle
populateList function to be a little bit
more resilient. Meaning that I could pass

00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:14.210 line:100% position:50% align:middle
in any array of plates and any destination
HTML element, and it will work.

00:08:14.210 --> 00:08:19.140 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So if in the future I decided to have two
different lists or two different menus,

00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:23.660 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that would be fine. I could still use a
single populateList function and just pass

00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:27.880 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it a different array of items and a
different HTML element to dump it.

00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:32.730 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we go inside of here and we take this
plate's array here, and we are going to

00:08:32.730 --> 00:08:38.850 line:100% position:50% align:middle
map over it. So we hit Map. We take our
item, or let's call it "plate,"

00:08:38.850 --> 00:08:43.300 line:100% position:50% align:middle
singular, and then we have the index and
I'll show you why we need that in just a

00:08:43.300 --> 00:08:48.630 line:100% position:50% align:middle
second. Now, from here this is going to
return some HTML. So we're going to use

00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:53.820 line:100% position:50% align:middle
back ticks. The last thing we need to do
is, in front of this plates.map,

00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:58.350 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we need to stick this either in a variable
or directly into the HTML.

00:08:58.350 --> 00:09:04.140 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So I'm going to say "plateslist[removed]
=" and I'll show you what this does in

00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:09.580 line:100% position:50% align:middle
just a second. So we're going to loop over
every single item in our array,

00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:12.960 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and that's just an object and we're going
to map. Which again,

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:19.710 line:100% position:50% align:middle
a map will take in an array of raw data
and return an array of some other data.

00:09:19.710 --> 00:09:24.080 line:100% position:50% align:middle
In our case, we're going to take in the
objects and return a string from each one.

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:27.120 line:100% position:50% align:middle
That's why we're using these back ticks
here. So we're going to give ourselves a

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:34.240 line:100% position:50% align:middle
list item, and then let's just take a
label and let's forget about all of the

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:39.960 line:100% position:50% align:middle
stuff. Let's just get it working. We'll
put "plate.text" inside of it.

00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:46.810 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Then, the last thing we need to do is call
a ".join" on here. Because map is going to

00:09:46.810 --> 00:09:51.870 line:100% position:50% align:middle
return an array, when really if we're
setting inner HTML, we just need one big

00:09:51.870 --> 00:09:57.750 line:100% position:50% align:middle
string. So this little ".join" on the end
is going to take this array that map makes

00:09:57.750 --> 00:10:01.140 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and turn it into one big string. So if we
have six or seven items,

00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:05.240 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it's not going to give us an array with
six strings. It's going to give us one

00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:13.430 line:100% position:50% align:middle
huge string. So now, if we take this
populateList, you go back up here right

00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:19.610 line:100% position:50% align:middle
before we run it, and we run populateList.
We are going to pass it our list of items

00:10:19.610 --> 00:10:24.390 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and our itemsList. Let's try it out. So if
I type "fish", aha,

00:10:24.390 --> 00:10:31.600 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"fish" and "squid," and "tacos," and you
see what's happening here is that every

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:36.550 line:100% position:50% align:middle
time we add an item, we are calling this
populateList function,

00:10:36.550 --> 00:10:41.910 line:100% position:50% align:middle
which is then going to create a list item
with a label inside of it.

00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:46.470 line:100% position:50% align:middle
You can inspect this and see what we've
got going on here. It's going to create a

00:10:46.470 --> 00:10:50.110 line:100% position:50% align:middle
list item. One thing that I should say is
this populateList function,

00:10:50.110 --> 00:10:55.960 line:100% position:50% align:middle
every time we add an item, it's recreating
the entire list. So if you are really

00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:59.530 line:100% position:50% align:middle
worried about performance, in this case
it's not a big deal. It's very,

00:10:59.530 --> 00:11:05.800 line:100% position:50% align:middle
very fast. But if you were doing this
maybe every half a second or every second,

00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:10.170 line:100% position:50% align:middle
or you had a bunch of animations, you
would want to look at, "How do I update

00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:15.070 line:100% position:50% align:middle
just that one list item that I have,
rather than rerender the entire list?"

00:11:15.070 --> 00:11:18.790 line:100% position:50% align:middle
That's where something like React or
Angular becomes really helpful,

00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:22.500 line:100% position:50% align:middle
because they're smart enough to know,
"Okay. Rather than just blowing away this

00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:27.630 line:100% position:50% align:middle
entire unordered list and rerendering the
whole thing, let me just figure out what's

00:11:27.630 --> 00:11:33.490 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the minimum HTML that I need to change on
the page without having to change the rest

00:11:33.490 --> 00:11:38.340 line:100% position:50% align:middle
of it. So we've got this label here, and
above it I'm going to have an input with

00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:44.910 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the type of checkbox. We need a
"data-index," and I'll show you why that's

00:11:44.910 --> 00:11:51.760 line:100% position:50% align:middle
helpful in just a few minutes. We're going
to set that to the index that we have

00:11:51.760 --> 00:12:00.310 line:100% position:50% align:middle
here. We're going to have an ID, which is
going to be Item I, because that's going

00:12:00.310 --> 00:12:05.690 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to be Item 1, Item 2, Item 3, Item 4.
Here, we need to go back to our label and

00:12:05.690 --> 00:12:12.040 line:100% position:50% align:middle
hook that ID up. So we'll say "Item I",
and that's how when you click on the label

00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:16.920 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the input will check itself. That's how we
link the two. The ID and the "for" are

00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:22.060 line:100% position:50% align:middle
exactly the same thing. Then, finally, we
need to know whether or not these items

00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:26.700 line:100% position:50% align:middle
are going to be checked or not. Because
when I rerender it, if it's already

00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:30.730 line:100% position:50% align:middle
checked, if it has a Done status, we need
to put the "checked" attribute.

00:12:30.730 --> 00:12:37.330 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So if I were to say "checked," then all of
them would automatically be checked.

00:12:37.330 --> 00:12:47.480 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So if I add "fish," see that has a
"checked" state? But we have to look at

00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:52.810 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the items in there, and the first one has
a property of "done".

00:12:52.810 --> 00:12:57.060 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So if it has a property of "done," put the
"checked" attribute.

00:12:57.060 --> 00:13:00.060 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Otherwise, we leave it off. Because you
might know that you cannot say

00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:05.210 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"checked=false." That will still make
it... Watch. If I say "checked=false" and

00:13:05.210 --> 00:13:13.420 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I type in "fish," it still checks it. If I
say "checked=emoji poop,"

00:13:13.420 --> 00:13:17.980 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it's still checked. That's because
anything, any existence of the property

00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:24.180 line:100% position:50% align:middle
checked or the attribute checked will make
it check. So we need to create a turnery

00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:29.810 line:100% position:50% align:middle
operator here, where we say if the
"plate.done" attribute is true,

00:13:29.810 --> 00:13:34.600 line:100% position:50% align:middle
then we're going to put the checked.
Otherwise, we're just going to do nothing.

00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:38.800 line:100% position:50% align:middle
It's just an empty string. Sometimes I
thought to put "null" here.

00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:43.990 line:100% position:50% align:middle
But the word "null" will actually show up
in your HTML. So you need two blank

00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:48.910 line:100% position:50% align:middle
strings. Let's see if anything is broken.
Good. "Fish" is working.

00:13:48.910 --> 00:13:52.150 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Then, when I click it, it will check the
taco on and off. If you're wondering how I

00:13:52.150 --> 00:13:56.780 line:100% position:50% align:middle
did this custom thing here, if you take a
look at the input box,

00:13:56.780 --> 00:14:00.850 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you'll see that I've displayed "none;". If
I take that off, the input box is actually

00:14:00.850 --> 00:14:07.460 line:100% position:50% align:middle
still there. I've just hidden it with CSS.
If we open up our CSS here,

00:14:07.460 --> 00:14:13.980 line:100% position:50% align:middle
let's look for the tacos, here we go, what
we say is the plate input,

00:14:13.980 --> 00:14:19.790 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the label before it, has a blank sort of
emoji that's just a square,

00:14:19.790 --> 00:14:25.140 line:100% position:50% align:middle
but then when the input is checked, turn
that content from a blank square into a

00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:29.830 line:100% position:50% align:middle
taco. So you could really put anything you
wanted here, and it will turn it on and

00:14:29.830 --> 00:14:33.860 line:100% position:50% align:middle
off. It's sort of a little trick that you
can do to make it work.

00:14:33.860 --> 00:14:37.340 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I think it looks a little bit better, and
that's a way that you can still have your

00:14:37.340 --> 00:14:42.890 line:100% position:50% align:middle
proper checkbox for data. But you can
display them with whatever HTML or CSS

00:14:42.890 --> 00:14:48.440 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that you want. So we've got that up and
running. Every time I add a new item it

00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:55.510 line:100% position:50% align:middle
will add it to the list, and I can check
it and uncheck it. The other problem here

00:14:55.510 --> 00:15:02.300 line:100% position:50% align:middle
is that when I refresh the page, that list
is not persisting. So what we're going to

00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:06.220 line:100% position:50% align:middle
do is we're going to be storing our data
in local storage. Now,

00:15:06.220 --> 00:15:10.760 line:100% position:50% align:middle
if you've never worked with local storage
before, essentially how it works is that

00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:16.010 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you have this object in the browser called
"Local Storage." If you open that up,

00:15:16.010 --> 00:15:24.180 line:100% position:50% align:middle
this is just a list of things that have
been saved to this domain.

00:15:24.180 --> 00:15:29.320 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So this is only a computer by computer,
browser by browser, website by website

00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:34.210 line:100% position:50% align:middle
basis. But you're able to save text to the
browser, and then when you reload the page

00:15:34.210 --> 00:15:38.300 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you'll be able to grab this text out of
it. So if you go to your Application tab

00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:42.230 line:100% position:50% align:middle
in Chrome Dev Tools, there's a whole bunch
of stuff here. If you go to Local Storage

00:15:42.230 --> 00:15:45.430 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and you click on the domain that you're
working on, in this case I'm working

00:15:45.430 --> 00:15:50.500 line:100% position:50% align:middle
locally so it's just "file," you should
see that there's a key of Items and a

00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:53.550 line:100% position:50% align:middle
value of something else. Now, you might
see a whole bunch of other stuff here,

00:15:53.550 --> 00:15:57.980 line:100% position:50% align:middle
depending if you've ever run other
applications on your local host.

00:15:57.980 --> 00:16:04.440 line:100% position:50% align:middle
This is where I've stored the text of what
we're going for and the property of done

00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:11.560 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to "false" or "true," etc., etc. So how
do we actually save that to local storage

00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:16.640 line:100% position:50% align:middle
or done? Well, it's actually pretty easy.
When we populate the list here,

00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:21.500 line:100% position:50% align:middle
what we also need to do is set this item's
array into local storage.

00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:26.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So you think you might be able to do this,
localStorage. , and then the API is

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:32.770 line:100% position:50% align:middle
.setItem, .getItem, and .removeItem or
deleteItem. I'll double check that.

00:16:32.770 --> 00:16:36.910 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So localStorage.setItem, and then we're
going to set the item,

00:16:36.910 --> 00:16:41.170 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"Items." That's the key right here, what
it's going to be called.

00:16:41.170 --> 00:16:44.050 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Then, what are you going to set the data
to? Well, you might just think,

00:16:44.050 --> 00:16:48.430 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"Okay. I'll just pass items, because
that's my items array." "Fish."

00:16:48.430 --> 00:16:52.470 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Okay. So we just ran it. We gathered the
item, we populated to the list,

00:16:52.470 --> 00:16:55.400 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and then we called
"localStorage.setItems." We go to our

00:16:55.400 --> 00:17:02.450 line:100% position:50% align:middle
local storage here, and you see this,
"object Object." What does that mean?

00:17:02.450 --> 00:17:06.990 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Well, what's happening here is that local
storage, although it seems like it's an

00:17:06.990 --> 00:17:14.250 line:100% position:50% align:middle
object, it's simply just a key value store
and you may only use strings in local

00:17:14.250 --> 00:17:20.390 line:100% position:50% align:middle
storage. So if we were to take our items
here and call ".toString" on it,

00:17:20.390 --> 00:17:25.460 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you see "object Object". What's happening
is that when you try to put something

00:17:25.460 --> 00:17:29.540 line:100% position:50% align:middle
other than a string into local storage,
the browser goes, "Oh,

00:17:29.540 --> 00:17:33.360 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I don't know how to handle this. Let me
just convert it to a string,

00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:38.580 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and let me just use the .toString method
that exists on the number or the object,

00:17:38.580 --> 00:17:42.660 line:100% position:50% align:middle
or the array." In our case, it's an array.
What returns is the browser goes,

00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:47.380 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"object Object" and that's its
representation. So we can't really do

00:17:47.380 --> 00:17:51.520 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that, because there's not actually an
object here. It's just the word "object

00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:58.310 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Object". So what we actually need to do is
stringify it before we convert it.

00:17:58.310 --> 00:18:02.120 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So in the browser, we have this thing
called "JSON.stringify" and when you pass

00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:08.770 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it your items, it's going to convert your
objects and arrays into a JSON string

00:18:08.770 --> 00:18:14.040 line:100% position:50% align:middle
equivalent. So we just need to wrap this
sucker. You send out "parse(items),"

00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:23.630 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and now when you add an item in here,
"fish," oh, "Unexpected token o at JSON."

00:18:23.630 --> 00:18:28.240 line:100% position:50% align:middle
What is our problem? Oh, we're not parsed.
JSON.stringify. Parsed is going to be the

00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:38.090 line:100% position:50% align:middle
other way. "Fish" and "tacos," and "yum,"
and now when you go to your Application

00:18:38.090 --> 00:18:42.730 line:100% position:50% align:middle
tab here, you see that this is now being
stored. It looks like an array of objects,

00:18:42.730 --> 00:18:46.440 line:100% position:50% align:middle
but it really is just text. I can show you
that, because we can say

00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:53.380 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"localStorage.getItem('items')." That is
just a string. However,

00:18:53.380 --> 00:18:59.120 line:100% position:50% align:middle
what you can do is you can wrap that thing
in the JSON.parse and that's going to then

00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:03.510 line:100% position:50% align:middle
take it from the string and put it back
into whatever it was initially.

00:19:03.510 --> 00:19:08.810 line:100% position:50% align:middle
In this case, it's going to be an array of
actual objects. So that's what we need to

00:19:08.810 --> 00:19:16.330 line:100% position:50% align:middle
do on page load. We go down here and when
the page loads, the very last thing,

00:19:16.330 --> 00:19:23.260 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we'll say "populateList" and we can say
"items." But again, you don't know.

00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:27.870 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Do we have to do JSON.parse? No, not here.
We are going to say "items" and

00:19:27.870 --> 00:19:33.400 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"itemsList." But the "items" doesn't exist
on page load. Remember,

00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:38.460 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the first thing we do up here is we create
an empty object? So what we can do is we

00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:43.390 line:100% position:50% align:middle
can say "items =
JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('items'))

00:19:43.390 --> 00:19:51.360 line:100% position:50% align:middle
or a blank array. What that will do is
it's going to try and get it from local

00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:59.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
storage, and then if it isn't there it's
going to fall back to an empty array.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:02.950 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Then, on page load, before we do any of
this stuff, our Items is going to be

00:20:02.950 --> 00:20:09.100 line:100% position:50% align:middle
populated, and then when we reach here we
can call our "populateList" just as we did

00:20:09.100 --> 00:20:15.530 line:100% position:50% align:middle
right here. So if we refresh the page now,
oh-ho, you see that our "fish,"

00:20:15.530 --> 00:20:20.260 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"tacos," and "yum" is now persisting. I
can refresh all that I want,

00:20:20.260 --> 00:20:25.710 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and the data is always going to be there.
So a real quick review of what we just did

00:20:25.710 --> 00:20:30.240 line:100% position:50% align:middle
there. When we add an item, you put it
into local storage and you update your

00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:36.790 line:100% position:50% align:middle
local storage every single time. Then, on
page load, what's going to happen is that

00:20:36.790 --> 00:20:41.650 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we check if there is something in local
storage, and then we fall back to an empty

00:20:41.650 --> 00:20:44.660 line:100% position:50% align:middle
array. Now, I just want to make sure that
that still works with nothing.

00:20:44.660 --> 00:20:49.240 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we can go to our application, File,
click on this thing, and exit.

00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:54.230 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Then, when we refresh the page, you see
that there is nothing there.

00:20:54.230 --> 00:20:59.110 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So if I type in "items", you see that it's
fallen back to this square bracket,

00:20:59.110 --> 00:21:03.840 line:100% position:50% align:middle
which is a blank array. Okay. Good. Good.
Good. We are in good shape.

00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:09.290 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Next, what we need to do is persist the
toggling of it. Because if you add in

00:21:09.290 --> 00:21:16.390 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"fish" and "tacos," and "yum," and you
check one and refresh the page,

00:21:16.390 --> 00:21:24.450 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that state is no longer handled. So what
we need to do is create a new function

00:21:24.450 --> 00:21:29.520 line:100% position:50% align:middle
called "toggleDone," and then we're going
to pass the event there.

00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:36.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now, when will this function run? Let's go
down here. You think that you would select

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:41.440 line:100% position:50% align:middle
each of the checkboxes right here, and
then listen for either a change or a click

00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:48.250 line:100% position:50% align:middle
event on those checkboxes. Then, when that
happens you will go ahead and perform

00:21:48.250 --> 00:21:53.690 line:100% position:50% align:middle
something. Now, let me show you a real
quick example. If I say "const checkBoxes

00:21:53.690 --> 00:21:58.610 line:100% position:50% align:middle
= document.querySelectorAll, and I'm just
going to select every input on the page,

00:21:58.610 --> 00:22:05.320 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and I'll say checkBoxes.forEach(input =>
input.addEventListener('click'".

00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:11.330 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Then, when that runs, I'm just going to
run a quick function here,

00:22:11.330 --> 00:22:18.710 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that will alert I. Okay. What I did there,
when I click on a checkbox,

00:22:18.710 --> 00:22:22.420 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we should alert "hi." So click it, and
when I click one of them,

00:22:22.420 --> 00:22:29.800 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we showed alert "hi," but it's not
working. Hmm, what's going on here?

00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:37.430 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Well, if we look at our checkboxes array,
there's two things in there and it's this

00:22:37.430 --> 00:22:42.150 line:100% position:50% align:middle
thing. Okay. So when I click on that, that
works. When we click on Add Item,

00:22:42.150 --> 00:22:47.700 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that works. So where are these three
inputs? Why are they not showing up in my

00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:53.770 line:100% position:50% align:middle
note list? The problem that we've run into
here is that when this code runs,

00:22:53.770 --> 00:22:58.470 line:100% position:50% align:middle
when our event listener runs, when our
selector runs, this doesn't exist yet.

00:22:58.470 --> 00:23:01.790 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Why? Because we need to populate the list
first. So you might think,

00:23:01.790 --> 00:23:06.870 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"Okay. That's fine. Let's populate the
list first and let's take a look at our

00:23:06.870 --> 00:23:11.880 line:100% position:50% align:middle
checkboxes array." Okay. Look at it.
There's more. There they are.

00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:15.650 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Okay. Are we out? Now, if I click on one
of these, okay, now it's working.

00:23:15.650 --> 00:23:22.270 line:100% position:50% align:middle
But what happens if I add an additional
item like here? "Hello."

00:23:22.270 --> 00:23:25.530 line:100% position:50% align:middle
It adds it. Okay, good. Now, I'm going to
click on this checkbox.

00:23:25.530 --> 00:23:34.300 line:100% position:50% align:middle
It doesn't work. Does "yum" still work?
No. None of these work now.

00:23:34.300 --> 00:23:40.050 line:100% position:50% align:middle
What's happening is because these inputs
here are created after we listen for them,

00:23:40.050 --> 00:23:44.280 line:100% position:50% align:middle
they don't have event listeners attached
to them. The whole idea behind event

00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:48.830 line:100% position:50% align:middle
delegation is rather than listening for a
click or a change on these checkboxes

00:23:48.830 --> 00:23:55.120 line:100% position:50% align:middle
directly, what we do is we look for
somebody who is going to be on the page at

00:23:55.120 --> 00:24:00.250 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the time of listening. If we look at our
HTML here, you're going to see that that

00:24:00.250 --> 00:24:05.140 line:100% position:50% align:middle
unordered list that holds everything, UL
with a class of "plates,"

00:24:05.140 --> 00:24:09.600 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that does exist. So what we're going to do
is we're going to listen for a click on

00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:13.430 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the plates, and then we're going to figure
out, "Did they actually mean to click one

00:24:13.430 --> 00:24:18.050 line:100% position:50% align:middle
of the inputs inside of it?" So I always
like to think of event delegation as very

00:24:18.050 --> 00:24:23.680 line:100% position:50% align:middle
responsible parents, like UL with a class
of "plates," and very negligent children

00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:28.760 line:100% position:50% align:middle
who don't necessarily hear any
instructions from the parents. So what

00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:33.510 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we're saying is, "Hey, plates. When your
children inputs get clicked,

00:24:33.510 --> 00:24:38.790 line:100% position:50% align:middle
can you please pass this click on to
them?" Rather than you handling the click

00:24:38.790 --> 00:24:43.240 line:100% position:50% align:middle
directly, we're just telling you because
you're the only one responsible here.

00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:46.290 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So that when someone clicks it, if it's
for one of your children,

00:24:46.290 --> 00:24:49.140 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I don't know if they're your current
children or you're going to make more

00:24:49.140 --> 00:24:53.040 line:100% position:50% align:middle
children in the future, but if you make
more in the future, make sure you tell

00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:57.170 line:100% position:50% align:middle
them to handle this click. So you've got
to think of like, responsible parent,

00:24:57.170 --> 00:25:01.020 line:100% position:50% align:middle
negligent child who doesn't necessarily
know what to do with the click.

00:25:01.020 --> 00:25:04.440 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So the parent has to tell it what to do.
So let's go back to this code here.

00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:08.690 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We're going to delete these checkboxes
here if you type that. We just want this

00:25:08.690 --> 00:25:15.010 line:100% position:50% align:middle
populatedList and addItem with that
listener. We are going to listen for the

00:25:15.010 --> 00:25:19.900 line:100% position:50% align:middle
click on the unordered list, which is this
itemsList right here.

00:25:19.900 --> 00:25:24.790 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we'll say, just duplicate this,
"itemsList.addEventListener."

00:25:24.790 --> 00:25:30.230 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We're going to listen for a click. When
that happens, we're going to "toggleDone."

00:25:30.230 --> 00:25:35.850 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Then, inside of here, I'm going to
console.log the E. Let's go back to our

00:25:35.850 --> 00:25:42.030 line:100% position:50% align:middle
console here. Now, let's click on one of
these. Uh-oh. Okay. That's interesting.

00:25:42.030 --> 00:25:45.990 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We're getting two different mouse event
handlers. Let's click on this one right

00:25:45.990 --> 00:25:52.860 line:100% position:50% align:middle
here. Whoa. What's going on here? So we're
getting two different event listeners here

00:25:52.860 --> 00:25:57.670 line:100% position:50% align:middle
when we click on something. What we can do
a little bit further is if we look at the

00:25:57.670 --> 00:26:04.550 line:100% position:50% align:middle
target of that event, let's see what we're
working with here, click on Tacos,

00:26:04.550 --> 00:26:08.080 line:100% position:50% align:middle
ah. So what's happening here is that we're
clicking on the item,

00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:16.190 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and we're also clicking on the checkbox.
Because our click on Label is in turn

00:26:16.190 --> 00:26:22.060 line:100% position:50% align:middle
checking the checkbox, which will trigger
a click on the actual input.

00:26:22.060 --> 00:26:26.760 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Okay, good. Then, what else? Like if we
click on something here that isn't

00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:30.510 line:100% position:50% align:middle
necessarily the list item or the input,
you see the label is there,

00:26:30.510 --> 00:26:36.690 line:100% position:50% align:middle
if we click like right here in between,
what do we got? We get the LI.

00:26:36.690 --> 00:26:40.720 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So you see as we click different items,
the target is going to be a little bit

00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:47.100 line:100% position:50% align:middle
different. What we want to do here is we
want to check if the target matches the

00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:53.320 line:100% position:50% align:middle
thing that we're looking for. So we'll
say, "If the e.target.matches," this is

00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:58.370 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the new API in the browser, "input," and
this is sort of like if you've ever worked

00:26:58.370 --> 00:27:04.960 line:100% position:50% align:middle
with jquery.isaninput, it's the same thing
as .matches, then we want to return.

00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:15.070 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Which means they skip this unless it's in
input. Then, let's console.log the target.

00:27:15.070 --> 00:27:20.150 line:100% position:50% align:middle
There we go. Now, wherever we click, we're
only getting input checks.

00:27:20.150 --> 00:27:24.130 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Good. So now, we have that working. Again,
that's event delegation,

00:27:24.130 --> 00:27:28.580 line:100% position:50% align:middle
where we listen for a click on something
higher, and then inside of it we check if

00:27:28.580 --> 00:27:32.880 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it's the actual thing that we want because
it could trigger on a few different

00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:37.780 line:100% position:50% align:middle
things. Now, what we want to do is we want
to go to our items array,

00:27:37.780 --> 00:27:44.090 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and we want to find the one that was
checked and set the done to be "true" or

00:27:44.090 --> 00:27:49.750 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"false," depending on what state it's in.
So we can first get the index,

00:27:49.750 --> 00:27:56.660 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and this is why I gave each input a
data-index value, because we can then use

00:27:56.660 --> 00:28:03.300 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that to reference where it is in the
array. So if we say "const el = e.target",

00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:08.150 line:100% position:50% align:middle
so put it in its own, now that we have
that element, we can console.log,

00:28:08.150 --> 00:28:13.990 line:100% position:50% align:middle
el.dataset.index. This is why we put a
data-index on each of the checkboxes.

00:28:13.990 --> 00:28:18.230 line:100% position:50% align:middle
You check one, it's going to tell you the
index of the corresponding item in the

00:28:18.230 --> 00:28:24.850 line:100% position:50% align:middle
array. Then, from that we'll take that
index, we'll stick it in its own variable

00:28:24.850 --> 00:28:32.780 line:100% position:50% align:middle
just for simplicity's sake, and then we'll
take our items with the index and we'll

00:28:32.780 --> 00:28:38.990 line:100% position:50% align:middle
access the done property. We'll set it to
itself, but this is the trick,

00:28:38.990 --> 00:28:44.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the opposite. So if this is true, it's
going to be the opposite,

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:46.920 line:100% position:50% align:middle
which is false. If this is false, it's
going to be the opposite,

00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:52.510 line:100% position:50% align:middle
which is true. So this is just
flip-flopping between true and false.

00:28:52.510 --> 00:28:56.410 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Then, we're going to do the same thing
that we did with the stringify,

00:28:56.410 --> 00:29:01.590 line:100% position:50% align:middle
localStorage right here. Take that. Stick
it right in here. Then,

00:29:01.590 --> 00:29:08.750 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we will run populateList once more, which
will update the actual visibility part on

00:29:08.750 --> 00:29:11.990 line:100% position:50% align:middle
here. So we're going to change the
property, we're going to store that in

00:29:11.990 --> 00:29:15.680 line:100% position:50% align:middle
local storage, and we're going to visually
update what's on our page.

00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:20.070 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now when we refresh "tacos", and I should
refresh the page now,

00:29:20.070 --> 00:29:24.730 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"tacos" is always going to be "true". Why?
Because if we go to our application and we

00:29:24.730 --> 00:29:32.060 line:100% position:50% align:middle
look at our local storage here, you should
see that "tacos" is "true" and done is

00:29:32.060 --> 00:29:35.990 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"false". If I were to just mainly change
this to "false" and the first one to

00:29:35.990 --> 00:29:40.790 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"true", then I refresh the page, you'll
see now "fish" is checked and "tacos".

So every time we make a change, we are
going to mirror that to local storage,

00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:51.030 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and then rerender the entire list. Or even
better, if you can figure out,

00:29:51.030 --> 00:29:56.340 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"How do I rerender just that one?" that's
even better. So that's it for today's.

00:29:56.340 --> 00:30:01.550 line:100% position:50% align:middle
What I will now challenge you to do is
make a button right here that says Clear

00:30:01.550 --> 00:30:06.330 line:100% position:50% align:middle
All or Check All, or Uncheck All. When you
click that Delete button,

00:30:06.330 --> 00:30:10.020 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it'll delete all of them. When you click
Check All, it will make them all checked.

00:30:10.020 --> 00:30:13.960 line:100% position:50% align:middle
When you click Uncheck All, it will
uncheck all of them and mirror it to local

00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:17.830 line:100% position:50% align:middle
storage, as well as rerun this populated
list. Thanks a lot, and I'll see you in

00:30:17.830 --> 00:30:18.780 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the next one.

00:30:18.780 --> 00:30:20.780 line:100% position:50% align:middle
