00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13,070 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Everybody, all right, let's get rolling. I
sure hope you're really excited about

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:16,560 line:100% position:50% align:middle
JavaScript 30. Couple of things I need to
talk to you about before we get going.

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19,710 line:100% position:50% align:middle
First, you need to download the starter
files. You can get those in your account

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:25,360 line:100% position:50% align:middle
dashboard, that's how you got to these
videos on javascript30.com... account.

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:30,680 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And then, we also need a modern
browser. Chrome, Safari, Firefox.

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:34,600 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Any of those are going to be supporting
all of the code that we write in this.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:39,230 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We're going to be writing a lot of ES6
stuff, so make sure it is up-to-date.

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:42,100 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Other than that, there's no compilers
or anything that we need to get

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45,230 line:100% position:50% align:middle
set up. There's no tooling chain involved.
All you need to do is right-click,

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:48,400 line:100% position:50% align:middle
open in browser for most of these. Couple
of them, like the webcam and the

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51,620 line:100% position:50% align:middle
microphone, they have security.
You can't open them up on a file,

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54,450 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you need a local host server. We'll
cover that in those videos,

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:55,750 line:100% position:50% align:middle
not a big deal.

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:00,900 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Let's see what else we got here. Couple
things. You're welcome to take the course

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:07,170 line:100% position:50% align:middle
at any pace that you like. The videos
range from 10 minutes up to half an hour,

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12,220 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and really, the thing I want you to do is
to try to carve out some time every single

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15,350 line:100% position:50% align:middle
day. You may do more in one day if
you've got a bunch of time available,

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:19,600 line:100% position:50% align:middle
but that sort of habit of, "Oh, I've got
lunch," or, "I've got 20 minutes," "I've

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22,650 line:100% position:50% align:middle
got half an hour here," or "I'm on the
subway, I should watch a video really

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26,940 line:100% position:50% align:middle
quickly," that's the habit that I want you
to get into, where you can just tackle

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:31,270 line:100% position:50% align:middle
something and finish it within
an hour or so, or half an hour,

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:33,860 line:100% position:50% align:middle
depending on how long the actual video is.

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:38,110 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Second, people learn in different ways, so
there's three major ways that you might

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41,810 line:100% position:50% align:middle
want to watch these videos. First, you
might just want to watch them entirely and

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45,990 line:100% position:50% align:middle
then try to build the things that were
done. Some people prefer to just sit back,

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50,900 line:100% position:50% align:middle
watch it on the subway, something like
that. Other people like to see what we're

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:54,670 line:100% position:50% align:middle
going to build, pause it, and then try to
build what we are without seeing the video

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:57,870 line:100% position:50% align:middle
at all, and then going back to the video
if they need help or seeing how I've done

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:00,650 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it. And then third, other people,
and this is how I like to learn,

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:04,530 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I like to build at the same time
as we are going through a video.

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08,420 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we build a little piece,
pause it, try to build it yourself,

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12,580 line:100% position:50% align:middle
try to do it at the same pace that I'm
doing it. Figure out what way that you

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15,539 line:100% position:50% align:middle
learn best, because that's
really going to help you out.

00:02:15.539 --> 00:02:22,090 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Second, there are 1001 ways to complete
these. The way I do it is not necessarily

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26,010 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the best way, it's just one way. So if
you come about it a different way,

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30,790 line:100% position:50% align:middle
totally fine. Don't worry about it. I've
intentionally stayed away from...what?

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:37,010 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Design patterns, classes, closures, of
course, any type of framework.

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:42,590 line:100% position:50% align:middle
These things are really good, but I just
want to stay away from any opinionated

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46,760 line:100% position:50% align:middle
stuff like that and really just get down
to understanding what is going on.

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:51,940 line:100% position:50% align:middle
You're welcome to implement it in
any which way that you want.

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:57,070 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Third, don't reach for jQuery,
Lodash, Underscore, boppity boop.

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:59,640 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Any framework that you're
used to, even though you think,

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02,500 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"Oh, Lodash has a handy little method
on it." Those things are great,

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:08,050 line:100% position:50% align:middle
but everything in this course can
be done with just plain JavaScript.

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:10,160 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Nothing else is needed for that.

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:15,800 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Finally, grab a friend, accountabilibuddy,
someone who you can do this course with.

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:19,870 line:100% position:50% align:middle
It's going to be helpful if you have a
friend you can bounce questions off,

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:23,940 line:100% position:50% align:middle
chat about what's going on in
the course, all that good stuff.

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26,930 line:100% position:50% align:middle
If you don't have a friend, you don't have
someone close to you or someone online

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:33,210 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that you can chat with, go on Twitter and
#javascript30. Ask for someone that is

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:36,720 line:100% position:50% align:middle
willing sort of team up with you. I think
that you'll get the most out of this

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40,360 line:100% position:50% align:middle
course if you have a friend that's going
to be doing it. People who have taken one

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:43,950 line:100% position:50% align:middle
of my paid premium courses before,
we have a Slack chat for you.

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:48,470 line:100% position:50% align:middle
You can join in on that. Other than
that, that's it. Go hit the videos,

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:49,320 line:100% position:50% align:middle
enjoy day one.

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:52,146 line:100% position:50% align:middle
