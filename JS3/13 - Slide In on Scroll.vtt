00:00:06.938 --> 00:00:11.530 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Today we are going to learn how
to build a slide in on scroll,

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:13.950 line:100% position:50% align:middle
when you slide down the images,
the images will sort of slide

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.180 line:100% position:50% align:middle
themselves in from the left or from the
right, and you can do whatever other

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:21.640 line:100% position:50% align:middle
animations you like to do. I've actually
got this request from a lot of people over

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:26.108 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the years and I'm always hesitant to do it
because I really don't like the effect all

00:00:26.108 --> 00:00:29.080 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that much. I think it's kind of
annoying to have to wait for it.

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:33.360 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Use this with your discretion. However,
that said, I think that you can learn a

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.580 line:100% position:50% align:middle
lot about window events, and then we're
also going to talk about debouncing,

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:41.510 line:100% position:50% align:middle
which is going to make sure that this is
not just hammering on scroll.

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:47.060 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Let's go down to our script tags here, and
you'll notice that I've already given you

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:50.580 line:100% position:50% align:middle
a debounce function here, and we're going
to talk about that in a second.

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:55.140 line:100% position:50% align:middle
But imagine it's not there, it's gone.
Okay, now what we want to do is first

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.600 line:100% position:50% align:middle
thing is we need to do is select all of
the images that we are going to be

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:05.926 line:100% position:50% align:middle
listening for, and if I open this up in
the browser here, you'll see that all the

00:01:05.926 --> 00:01:11.080 line:100% position:50% align:middle
images by default are being hidden. If you
inspect them, you'll see that I've just

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:15.710 line:100% position:50% align:middle
translated them off-screen just a little
bit as well as the opacity here.

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:22.120 line:100% position:50% align:middle
See, that's really where they are, and
then I've exed them off-screen.

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:25.320 line:100% position:50% align:middle
You could really do them all the way
off-screen if you prefer and then I've

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.900 line:100% position:50% align:middle
scaled them at 95% so it just gets a
little bit of nice little fade-in effect

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.260 line:100% position:50% align:middle
here. By default they are going to be
hidden, and when they scroll into view or

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:39.080 line:100% position:50% align:middle
when they are half-scrolled into view,
what we are going to do is we're going to

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:43.854 line:100% position:50% align:middle
apply a class called active, which is
right here, and that is going to bring the

00:01:43.854 --> 00:01:48.860 line:100% position:50% align:middle
opacity to one and translate the X to zero
putting it where it was and scaling it

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:55.170 line:100% position:50% align:middle
back up from 95% to 1 or 100%. We need to
select all the images that we're going to

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:02.180 line:100% position:50% align:middle
be working with here, so we will say,
const slider images equals

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:07.020 line:100% position:50% align:middle
document.queryselector all and we're going
to select every single image that we want

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:12.670 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to slide in and they all have a class of
slide-in. Good. Now what we want to do is

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:17.130 line:100% position:50% align:middle
create a function called check-slide
that will run every time the person

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:24.740 line:100% position:50% align:middle
scrolls. So function, check-slide, and
let's just pass ourselves the event and

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:34.180 line:100% position:50% align:middle
console log the event and then when the
window is scrolled, we are going to run

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.320 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the function check-slide. Let's take a
look at what we got here.

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:44.100 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Open up you devTools, watch this.
Whoa, look at this, I just logged like,

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:48.660 line:100% position:50% align:middle
hundreds and hundreds of events when I've
gone. And this can be a little bit of a

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:53.260 line:100% position:50% align:middle
performance issue because the amount of
times that it's actually running,

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.350 line:100% position:50% align:middle
here, let's do console.count. How many
times are we going to count this event

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:03.040 line:100% position:50% align:middle
here? I scrolled from top to bottom
and it logged it 50 times in like,

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.500 line:100% position:50% align:middle
a second. Another 50 times. If I just like
flick my finger, we're gonna run that

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:13.170 line:100% position:50% align:middle
function 50 times, and that is too much.
What we want to do is debounce it,

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:18.410 line:100% position:50% align:middle
which essentially means that we will only
run this function at most,

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:23.600 line:100% position:50% align:middle
however many seconds. What we've done here
is we have this debounce function and

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.950 line:100% position:50% align:middle
there is a debounce in Lodash, there's
functions all over the place.

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:30.710 line:100% position:50% align:middle
However, this is a framework-free
tutorial, so I've just grabbed a debounce

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:35.070 line:100% position:50% align:middle
function off the internet here.
Essentially what you do is you pass at a

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:40.550 line:100% position:50% align:middle
function and it will run debounce
all the time when we scroll,

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:46.340 line:100% position:50% align:middle
but it will actually only run the function
check-slide once every 20 milliseconds or

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:50.220 line:100% position:50% align:middle
once every 100 milliseconds, which is
going to give you a little bit more

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:54.820 line:100% position:50% align:middle
control and it's not going to give you
that hurt in performance.

00:03:54.820 --> 00:04:00.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We're going to wrap that in debounce
here, and now when I scroll,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.290 line:100% position:50% align:middle
look, it's scrolling from top to bottom
it's only running 7 times versus 50 times

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:09.640 line:100% position:50% align:middle
when I want to scroll up and down. Of
course, you can change that wait from 20

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:14.900 line:100% position:50% align:middle
seconds or 20 milliseconds if you wanted
to do only it once every half a second,

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:22.670 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you wanted to check for something like
this. You see it's very seldomly being

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:27.300 line:100% position:50% align:middle
called. That's what debouncing is. Anytime
you're doing something on scroll,

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:31.730 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you'll probably want to stop and you might
think like, "Oh, it's fine." But later

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:35.560 line:100% position:50% align:middle
down the road you might have animation
jank and a whole bunch of other stuff

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:39.980 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that's happening, so make sure that
you debounce your scroll functions.

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:43.590 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Good, now we're going to do all of our
work inside of this check-slide here,

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:47.750 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and we're going to talk about what's going
on here. The first thing that we need to

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:54.700 line:100% position:50% align:middle
do is loop over every single image and
figure out where the image needs to then

00:04:54.700 --> 00:05:01.780 line:100% position:50% align:middle
be shown. The idea here is that once the
image is, I like to call this peaking.

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:05.130 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Because like at this point, the image is
fully shown. At this point the image is

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:10.100 line:100% position:50% align:middle
fully hidden, but at about this point the
image is just peaking out about 50%.

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:16.880 line:100% position:50% align:middle
That's the point where when the image
should be on the page at least 50% of its

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:23.240 line:100% position:50% align:middle
height, then we want to animate that on
in. We're going to take our slider images,

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:28.170 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we're going to loop over each one with a
for each, that's going to give us a slider

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:35.590 line:100% position:50% align:middle
image. And for each of those, we're going
to have to do a whole bunch of math to

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:43.710 line:100% position:50% align:middle
decide whether it's on page or not. We're
going to say const slidein at equals.

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:49.480 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now, we need to get a couple of things
here. We need to figure out how far is the

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:55.800 line:100% position:50% align:middle
page being scrolled down, and that's with
something called window.scrollY.

00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:03.140 line:100% position:50% align:middle
If I were to go here and just console log
window.scrollY, and open this sucker up,

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:11.990 line:100% position:50% align:middle
if I just scroll a little bit,
window.scrollY. If I just scroll a little

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:17.950 line:100% position:50% align:middle
bit at this point, you see like I'm 67
pixels scrolled down. I'm 100 pixels

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:22.670 line:100% position:50% align:middle
scrolled down. I'm 151 pixels scrolled
down. That will tell us how much you are

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:26.770 line:100% position:50% align:middle
scrolled down, but that tells us how much
we are scrolled down at the very top of

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:31.840 line:100% position:50% align:middle
our browser. We want to know where
we are at the very bottom of our window,

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:38.690 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the viewport that we have here. What we
can do is we take window.scrollY and then

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:46.377 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we add the window.innerheight and that's
going to give us the pixel level for where

00:06:46.377 --> 00:06:51.460 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you currently are at the bottom of that.
And if we console log slidein at,

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:59.710 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you'll now see 600, see even at the top of
the page, I'm at 663 pixels and then as I

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:05.980 line:100% position:50% align:middle
scroll down, it's going to be telling me
how far down we are scrolled.

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:09.950 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Good, but we need to figure out, we don't
want to slidein just at the bottom right

00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:15.010 line:100% position:50% align:middle
here, we want to slidein at halfway
through the image here. We're going to

00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:20.710 line:100% position:50% align:middle
minus the slider image which is each
individual image. The height of that,

00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:27.330 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and that will allow us to slide in the
image at the very bottom but we want to

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:32.173 line:100% position:50% align:middle
slide it in when it's at the middle.
If we take that and divide it by two,

00:07:32.173 --> 00:07:38.180 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that will give us the pixel level of when
each of the images should be slid in at.

00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:43.130 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Let's take a look here. Now you see each
of the images are being a little bit

00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:46.540 line:100% position:50% align:middle
different because it's going to
be giving you that information.

00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:49.690 line:100% position:50% align:middle
The reason why we recalculate this every
single time is because if something

00:07:49.690 --> 00:07:53.880 line:100% position:50% align:middle
changes on the page, like, if you were to
put like a share this button and it bumped

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:57.110 line:100% position:50% align:middle
your content down, or someone
in order to resize their window,

00:07:57.110 --> 00:08:01.150 line:100% position:50% align:middle
then we would need to recalculate
where the images lie on the page.

00:08:01.150 --> 00:08:06.010 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Okay, good. Now we need to figure out
where's the bottom of the image because we

00:08:06.010 --> 00:08:10.730 line:100% position:50% align:middle
also want to know if we scrolled past the
image, it should slide itself back out

00:08:10.730 --> 00:08:15.020 line:100% position:50% align:middle
because we don't just want to scroll from
the top down. Sometimes if you scroll back

00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:22.230 line:100% position:50% align:middle
up, you want to have that same animation.
Say, const image bottom equals slider

00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:29.120 line:100% position:50% align:middle
image, that's the each individual image
.offsettop. OffsetTop is going to tell us

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:36.160 line:100% position:50% align:middle
take this image, it's going to tell us the
top of this image is how far from the top

00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:41.890 line:100% position:50% align:middle
of the actual window here. It's going to
give us a pixel level of how far down it

00:08:41.890 --> 00:08:47.250 line:100% position:50% align:middle
actually is. Then we want to know not
where the top of the image is,

00:08:47.250 --> 00:08:51.710 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we want to know where's the bottom of the
image. We just have to add the

00:08:51.710 --> 00:08:59.600 line:100% position:50% align:middle
sliderimage.height. That'll give
us the actual height of the image.

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:03.060 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Okay, good. We have the slidein at,
which is halfway through the image.

00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:10.530 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Maybe we should write some comments here.
Halfway through the image,

00:09:10.530 --> 00:09:17.930 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and this is the bottom of the image. Now,
we need to figure out first,

00:09:17.930 --> 00:09:24.670 line:100% position:50% align:middle
is the image half shown? And second,
if we're not scrolled past it.

00:09:24.670 --> 00:09:32.200 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Let's do the first one here. Const is half
shown, these are going to go into an

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:37.340 line:100% position:50% align:middle
if statement, but I always like to put my
variables that make sense for me to read

00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:39.920 line:100% position:50% align:middle
them, rather than just to stick
everything in an if statement,

00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:46.330 line:100% position:50% align:middle
come back a week later not sure what's
going on. Is half shown is equal to

00:09:46.330 --> 00:09:55.710 line:100% position:50% align:middle
slidein at is greater than the
sliderimage.offsettop and that will make

00:09:55.710 --> 00:10:02.089 line:100% position:50% align:middle
sure that our slidein at value is greater
than the top of where the actual image is,

00:10:02.089 --> 00:10:08.230 line:100% position:50% align:middle
so that's good. Then we will make
a is not scrolled past variable,

00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:12.860 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I realize that's a really long variable,
but it will help you in a second when we

00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:20.330 line:100% position:50% align:middle
do our if statements. Say window.scrollY
is less than image bottom.

00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:28.030 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We want to make sure that we are not
scrolled all the way past the image

00:10:28.030 --> 00:10:31.910 line:100% position:50% align:middle
because if we are, then we need to slide
it out again. And that's what this

00:10:31.910 --> 00:10:37.110 line:100% position:50% align:middle
variable is going to check, if that image,
if we're not scrolled past it.

00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:41.730 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Then finally, we have our if statement,
and that'll say if is half shown,

00:10:41.730 --> 00:10:48.030 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and is not scrolled past, so if it is half
shown on the page, and we are not scrolled

00:10:48.030 --> 00:10:53.640 line:100% position:50% align:middle
past it, then we are going to take that
image and we are going to grab the class

00:10:53.640 --> 00:11:02.400 line:100% position:50% align:middle
list and we are going to add active, else,
we are going to simply just remove that.

00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:08.190 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Because that means we have either scrolled
past it or have not got to it yet.

00:11:08.190 --> 00:11:12.320 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I've got a bit of red going on on my
editor it's telling me that that variable

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:19.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
has not been created because it is slider
image, there we go. Make sure you fix that

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:23.600 line:100% position:50% align:middle
one as well. Looks like we're in good
shape. Now, if you're having trouble

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:28.730 line:100% position:50% align:middle
understanding what these positions are, I
understand that scroll and position on the

00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:32.710 line:100% position:50% align:middle
page can be a little bit hard, just go
ahead and console log these values to

00:11:32.710 --> 00:11:37.170 line:100% position:50% align:middle
understand where they are. It sometimes
takes a little bit to get what's going on

00:11:37.170 --> 00:11:42.970 line:100% position:50% align:middle
here. But if this has worked, we should be
able to add a class of active to each of

00:11:42.970 --> 00:11:48.660 line:100% position:50% align:middle
our items here. Here we go. Oh, we got an
error, go to our console cannot read

00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:56.440 line:100% position:50% align:middle
property remove of undefined
classlist.remove. Class list. I'm sure

00:11:56.440 --> 00:12:03.630 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you're screaming at me, there we go. Now,
you can see as soon as we hit that halfway

00:12:03.630 --> 00:12:10.490 line:100% position:50% align:middle
point for the image, let's scroll all the
way out here, about to hit halfway,

00:12:10.490 --> 00:12:14.770 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and there we go, the image will add a
class of active and then as you go away,

00:12:14.770 --> 00:12:18.860 line:100% position:50% align:middle
as soon as you hit this value right here,
you can't see it, but as soon as it goes

00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:25.140 line:100% position:50% align:middle
off-screen, it's going to move itself on
out, and when we scroll back to it it will

00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:29.790 line:100% position:50% align:middle
show it again. Same with these ones
and this one as we scroll on down.

00:12:29.790 --> 00:12:33.910 line:100% position:50% align:middle
That's really it, there's not a whole lot
of code. It is a bit to understand all of

00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:38.080 line:100% position:50% align:middle
these scrollX and scrollY, especially if
you don't really like doing a bunch of

00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:42.240 line:100% position:50% align:middle
math at the same time. But again, what I
like to do is stick them into their own

00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:46.051 line:100% position:50% align:middle
variables before you do your if statement,
and console log these variables to

00:12:46.051 --> 00:12:49.610 line:100% position:50% align:middle
understand exactly what is going on.
Hopefully you enjoyed that,

00:12:49.610 --> 00:12:51.359 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and I will see you tomorrow.

00:12:51.957 --> 00:12:55.293 line:100% position:50% align:middle
