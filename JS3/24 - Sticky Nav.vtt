00:00:07.077 --> 00:00:08.772 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Today we're going to do something that...

00:00:08.772 --> 00:00:13.360 line:100% position:50% align:middle
this is probably one of the very first
things that I learned in jQuery when I was

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:18.210 line:100% position:50% align:middle
first starting to learn JavaScript and it
was how do I actually fix a nav when you

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.030 line:100% position:50% align:middle
scroll to it? So this is what we're going
to be building here where you've got

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:26.226 line:100% position:50% align:middle
this nav that's just position rolled over
static and then as soon as you hit that

00:00:26.226 --> 00:00:29.868 line:100% position:50% align:middle
point where it hits the top of the
browser, we're going to make it fixed

00:00:29.868 --> 00:00:33.616 line:100% position:50% align:middle
so the content scrolls underneath. And
then we can also do some hotshot stuff

00:00:33.616 --> 00:00:38.925 line:100% position:50% align:middle
like scroll out the logo or something like
that. So first thing we're going to do is

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.900 line:100% position:50% align:middle
grab this nav right here. So I'm going to
say const nav = document.querySelector

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:52.074 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and we're going to look for the nav with
the ID of main and then we're also

00:00:52.074 --> 00:00:56.754 line:100% position:50% align:middle
going to make a function called fixNav
that is then going to run every single

00:00:56.754 --> 00:01:05.798 line:100% position:50% align:middle
page scroll, awesome. So what this is
going to do is we're going to figure out

00:01:05.798 --> 00:01:12.778 line:100% position:50% align:middle
where the top of this navigation black bar
is. Let's say it's 500 pixels from the top

00:01:12.778 --> 00:01:17.618 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and then when we scroll, we're going to
figure out how far are we scrolled?

00:01:17.618 --> 00:01:21.844 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Let's say, right here, I'm about 400
pixels scrolled. But as soon as I hit that

00:01:21.844 --> 00:01:29.110 line:100% position:50% align:middle
threshold of scrolling more than the top
of the nav is, so as soon I've scroll 501

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:36.393 line:100% position:50% align:middle
pixels, the nav bar is going to go, "Oop,
I'm off screen, I should now fix myself."

00:01:36.393 --> 00:01:42.971 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So what we need to do on page load is
grab wherever the top of this nav

00:01:42.971 --> 00:01:51.810 line:100% position:50% align:middle
actually looks. So let's say
const topOfNav = nav.offsetTop.

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:57.210 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Then when you console.log(topOfNav)...
let's just console.log that every single

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.924 line:100% position:50% align:middle
time that we run it, open up your dev
tools. I recommend putting your dev tools

00:02:00.924 --> 00:02:06.229 line:100% position:50% align:middle
at the side here so that won't mess up
your top of nav here. You could also

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:11.353 line:100% position:50% align:middle
update this variable every time that your
window resizes just so that if somebody

00:02:11.353 --> 00:02:15.470 line:100% position:50% align:middle
does resize or open dev tools, you've got
it. So I'm going to scroll here and you

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:21.819 line:100% position:50% align:middle
see, it's 542 pixels, that is the top
of the navigation at that point.

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:29.760 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So what we can then do is we'll say
if(window.scrollY)... Why?

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.390 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Because what is window.scrollY? Let's go
back to that topOfNav and then we'll also

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.486 line:100% position:50% align:middle
console.log window.scrollY.
We've done this in a couple of tutorials

00:02:38.486 --> 00:02:42.930 line:100% position:50% align:middle
so far now. So now you're going to
see that the second value, 1,

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:47.510 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that's how far we've scrolled. And then
you're going to see that as we get closer

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:52.490 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and closer to where it's going to hit the
top, we're just about at that point where

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:57.760 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the 542 pixels is going to be equal
to the 542. And at that point,

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:02.770 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we want to make that nav fixed. So we're
going to go in here, we're going to say

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:09.215 line:100% position:50% align:middle
if(topOfNav >= window)...
or other way around,

00:03:09.215 --> 00:03:15.634 line:100% position:50% align:middle
window.scrollY >= topOfNav,
if that is true,

00:03:15.634 --> 00:03:18.800 line:100% position:50% align:middle
what we're going to do is we're going to
pop a class and when I do things like

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:23.480 line:100% position:50% align:middle
this, I like to pop a class on the body
just so that I can always target any of

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:27.480 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the children when we're in the fixed nav
state. Some people like to put it on the

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.784 line:100% position:50% align:middle
nav itself, but I found that if I
want to target anything else,

00:03:30.784 --> 00:03:33.452 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it's nice to have it nice
and high on the body,

00:03:33.452 --> 00:03:41.967 line:100% position:50% align:middle
document.body.classList.add('fixed-nav')
and then we'll say else,

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:46.918 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and we'll just duplicate this,
which you're going to remove.

00:03:46.918 --> 00:03:49.156 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now that's not going to
get us all the way there,

00:03:49.156 --> 00:03:53.814 line:100% position:50% align:middle
but if we save that now
and refresh, now as you scroll,

00:03:54.516 --> 00:04:00.605 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you'll see this fixed-nav is being added
and removed, but it's not actually fixing

00:04:00.605 --> 00:04:07.040 line:100% position:50% align:middle
itself. So we need to go over to our
style-start.CSS and find our navs CSS

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:11.471 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and this isn't the greatest CSS because
it's using just the element selectors

00:04:11.471 --> 00:04:13.846 line:100% position:50% align:middle
here. It should probably have a class or
something like that, but I'm trying to

00:04:13.846 --> 00:04:18.499 line:100% position:50% align:middle
keep it as simple as we can. And I'm going
to say when the body has a class of

00:04:18.499 --> 00:04:24.310 line:100% position:50% align:middle
.fixed-nav, the nav itself is going to be
positioned: fixed; and then I'm going to

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:29.550 line:100% position:50% align:middle
put a quick little box-shadow on there to
just give it a little bit of a shadow so

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:33.340 line:100% position:50% align:middle
when it is in that fixed state, you have a
shadow showing that you have some depth

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:38.936 line:100% position:50% align:middle
there. All right, so now, when I hit this
point... oh, you see what's happening?

00:04:38.936 --> 00:04:45.811 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now it seems to be working, but it
seems kind of janky. You see what's going

00:04:45.811 --> 00:04:52.694 line:100% position:50% align:middle
on here? As soon as we hit that little end
point there, the content jumps up and why

00:04:52.694 --> 00:04:58.300 line:100% position:50% align:middle
is that happening? Well, the reason for
that happening is because when you make

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:02.830 line:100% position:50% align:middle
this nav fixed, it is no longer
taking up space in the document.

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:07.214 line:100% position:50% align:middle
You know this from CSS. When you make
an element fixed, it no longer takes up

00:05:07.214 --> 00:05:11.507 line:100% position:50% align:middle
space. It sort of floats on top of
the browser. And by doing that,

00:05:11.507 --> 00:05:18.131 line:100% position:50% align:middle
what's happening is that we cause a reflow
on the page and this site wrap right here,

00:05:18.131 --> 00:05:24.223 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it says, "Oh, this nav is no longer taking
up space, well, I don't mind if I do,"

00:05:24.223 --> 00:05:29.989 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and it moves on up the exact amount of
space that it gave up, which is however

00:05:29.989 --> 00:05:36.100 line:100% position:50% align:middle
many pixels. So what we need to do is we
need to offset that amount by adding some

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:40.530 line:100% position:50% align:middle
padding to our body. So just as
we make it fixed, we need to

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:43.753 line:100% position:50% align:middle
offset that amount so they don't
get this jerky jump right here.

00:05:43.753 --> 00:05:48.889 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So let's go back to our element
right here and we're going to

00:05:48.889 --> 00:05:54.981 line:100% position:50% align:middle
take our document.body.style and
we're going to set the paddingTop,

00:05:55.425 --> 00:05:58.634 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and if you have something
that is a padding-top,

00:05:58.634 --> 00:06:01.826 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you cannot do that in JavaScript,
so that's a camel case.

00:06:01.826 --> 00:06:06.846 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And we're going to set that
to be the nav.offsetHeight.

00:06:06.846 --> 00:06:10.273 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Why? What is that going to give us? If I
were to run this in my console here,

00:06:11.362 --> 00:06:15.620 line:100% position:50% align:middle
nav.offsetHeight is going to give
us however large this nav is.

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:20.780 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And I've seen people just like hardcode
64px, but don't do that because then what

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:24.684 line:100% position:50% align:middle
happens if your nav changes or your font
changes or anything else and then you're

00:06:24.684 --> 00:06:29.170 line:100% position:50% align:middle
going to be off just a couple pixels. So
programmatically grab the height of the

00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:37.474 line:100% position:50% align:middle
pixels and then add on px to the top. And
then what we'll also do is on the opposite

00:06:37.474 --> 00:06:42.953 line:100% position:50% align:middle
end, we'll just set the padding top
to be zero, good. So now when...

00:06:42.953 --> 00:06:45.402 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Ooh, look at that,

00:06:45.402 --> 00:06:49.173 line:100% position:50% align:middle
so now we've got this nav, nav, nav,
normal, normal, normal, and then fixed.

00:06:49.173 --> 00:06:54.021 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And as soon as we hit that point, we don't
have that jump anymore. And your can go

00:06:54.021 --> 00:06:58.047 line:100% position:50% align:middle
into your Elements panel and take a
look at what's going on here. See this?

00:06:58.047 --> 00:07:04.070 line:100% position:50% align:middle
style= padding-top: 0 and then as soon as
we that point, the class of fixed goes on

00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:09.311 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and then the padding-top is 64px.
Again, you might be asking why don't

00:07:09.311 --> 00:07:15.648 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I just like put it in here when I have a
class of fixed-nav, give it padding-top

00:07:15.648 --> 00:07:20.387 line:100% position:50% align:middle
of 64 px? It's that we don't know how high
this nav is going to be and I'd rather do

00:07:20.387 --> 00:07:25.486 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it programmatically and do in line than
have to guess and update that every time

00:07:25.486 --> 00:07:30.080 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the nav changes itself. So that's looking
pretty good. So that's working great.

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:32.950 line:100% position:50% align:middle
There're a couple other things that
we can do. If you open up your nav,

00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:36.293 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you're going to see that we have
an li with a class of logo.

00:07:37.124 --> 00:07:41.323 line:100% position:50% align:middle
If we look into our style sheet here,
you'll see that I gave it a max-width

00:07:41.323 --> 00:07:47.790 line:100% position:50% align:middle
of 0 and give it an overflow of hidden.
So it's there, it's just not being shown

00:07:47.790 --> 00:07:51.486 line:100% position:50% align:middle
at all because it has a width of zero.
Then what we're going to do is we're going

00:07:51.486 --> 00:07:58.590 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to say, "When the body has a class of
fixed-nav, the li with a class of logo is

00:07:58.590 --> 00:08:02.690 line:100% position:50% align:middle
going to have a max-width of
something bigger than it will ever be,

00:08:02.783 --> 00:08:07.378 line:100% position:50% align:middle
like 500px," and I'll show you why in just
second, why we didn't use width

00:08:07.378 --> 00:08:10.570 line:100% position:50% align:middle
in this case. So give that
a save and now watch what

00:08:10.570 --> 00:08:15.676 line:100% position:50% align:middle
happens when we scroll, when we hit
that point, ooh, it slides itself out.

00:08:15.676 --> 00:08:22.930 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Why? Because we have set it to be default
0 and then when you have a max-width of

00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:28.166 line:100% position:50% align:middle
500, it's going to transition, which is
right here, you could set that to be 5px,

00:08:28.166 --> 00:08:33.897 line:100% position:50% align:middle
if you really like. And over five
seconds, it's going to animate itself in

00:08:33.897 --> 00:08:37.878 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and animate itself out. Now quick
question, this is a bit of an aside

00:08:37.878 --> 00:08:43.490 line:100% position:50% align:middle
nothing to do with JavaScript, why
didn't I do width and width: auto?

00:08:43.490 --> 00:08:49.897 line:100% position:50% align:middle
That's because you cannot animate
the width of something to be from zero

00:08:49.897 --> 00:08:56.502 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to auto. You do have to use a max-width
in order to get that transition to kick in

00:08:56.502 --> 00:09:01.247 line:100% position:50% align:middle
here. So nothing brings itself in,
obviously, let's do over half a second

00:09:01.247 --> 00:09:06.886 line:100% position:50% align:middle
instead. Brings itself in. And then
one last thing that I did is if you look

00:09:06.886 --> 00:09:14.273 line:100% position:50% align:middle
at this site wrap, you'll see I've given
it a scale of 98%. We can do here is

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:20.775 line:100% position:50% align:middle
when the body has a class of
fixed-nav, this site-wrap is going to...

00:09:21.658 --> 00:09:25.262 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we're going to transform,
we're going to scale it up to 1.

00:09:25.262 --> 00:09:29.219 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So it's just going to go from 98% to 1.
You're going to get this little...

00:09:30.584 --> 00:09:33.732 line:100% position:50% align:middle
You see how it sort of brings
itself in, a little bit effect.

00:09:33.732 --> 00:09:38.177 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I really like these things because all we
did there is add one class to the body

00:09:38.177 --> 00:09:42.023 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and then everything else is just
taken cared of in our CSS.

00:09:42.023 --> 00:09:46.375 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So hopefully you liked that, it's really
interesting. There's not a lot of code

00:09:46.375 --> 00:09:51.855 line:100% position:50% align:middle
but understanding that you need to take
care of that extra space when you fix it
