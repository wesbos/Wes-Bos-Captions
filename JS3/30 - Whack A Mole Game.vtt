00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:11.730 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Here we are on day 30, and to have a
little bit of fun today we are going,

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.120 line:100% position:50% align:middle
well like you didn't have fun the whole
time. But we're going to be building a

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.310 line:100% position:50% align:middle
game so you can have fun and play it and
just have a great time.

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:25.330 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So what we are building is Whack-a-mole,
and what happens is when you run the game

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:30.620 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you're going to get these little critters
popping up in random holes for for random

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:34.410 line:100% position:50% align:middle
amounts of time. And then when
you click them you get a point,

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.190 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you sort of have to follow it along with
your mouse. So there's a couple things we

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:42.700 line:100% position:50% align:middle
need to know here, the game itself is
going to be 10 seconds long,

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:49.440 line:100% position:50% align:middle
but which hole the mole pops up in and for
how long that mole peeps his head up from

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.090 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the ground is totally random, it's all
going to be between like 200 milliseconds

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:59.020 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and a couple of seconds, and then the mole
hill that it's going to pop up from is

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:04.350 line:100% position:50% align:middle
also going to be totally random as well.
So I've gone here and I've gone ahead and

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.420 line:100% position:50% align:middle
selected all of the holes, I've gone ahead
and selected the scoreboard which is the

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.400 line:100% position:50% align:middle
seven right here, and I've gone ahead and
selected all the moles.

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.990 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So look at our HTML here, you've got your
holes, you've got your moles in your

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:22.400 line:100% position:50% align:middle
holes, and were ready to roll with our
moles in our holes. So we first need a

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:27.330 line:100% position:50% align:middle
function that's going to give us a random
amount of time between hover minimum and

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:32.610 line:100% position:50% align:middle
maximum. So we're going to say, "function
randTime" and that's going to take a

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:40.600 line:100% position:50% align:middle
minimum and a maximum. And that will
return a "Math.random() * (max-min) +

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.670 line:100% position:50% align:middle
min;" And we've done this whole offset
thing a couple of times,

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.440 line:100% position:50% align:middle
now I'm not going to explain it again.
That should give us a function that if we

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:54.950 line:100% position:50% align:middle
open up in our browser here and we run
"randTime" and if we go between 20

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:59.400 line:100% position:50% align:middle
milliseconds and 2 seconds, it's just
going to give us a random amount of

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:05.130 line:100% position:50% align:middle
millisecond. We could probably also pop a
"Math.round" around that just so we can

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:11.370 line:100% position:50% align:middle
get a nice, clean number of milliseconds
back. There we go, now we're going to get

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.890 line:100% position:50% align:middle
a random amount of time that it's
going to be popping itself up.

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.560 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So that's one function, that's sort of a
bit of a utility. Then we needed other

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.580 line:100% position:50% align:middle
function that's going to pick a random
hole for the mole to pop up from.

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:31.670 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So, "function randomHole()" and that is
going to take in a list of holes,

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:36.770 line:100% position:50% align:middle
which is going to be, in our case it's
going to be this holes that we have here,

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:40.880 line:100% position:50% align:middle
however this could be any list of DOM
Elements. Essentially this is just a get

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:47.080 line:100% position:50% align:middle
me a random DOM Element function there.
And what we're going to do here is,

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:51.750 line:100% position:50% align:middle
let's just console log holes. Now if I
were to run "randHole()" and pass our

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:57.160 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"holes" variable, we're going to get six,
why? Because holes is a node list that

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:03.490 line:100% position:50% align:middle
contains all six of our holes. Okay, good.
So we need to find a random index between

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:07.907 line:100% position:50% align:middle
zero and five which is going to give us
that one, so we say "const idx =

00:03:07.907 --> 00:03:19.992 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Math.floor(Math.random() * holes.length;
const hole = holes[idx];" why?

00:03:19.992 --> 00:03:23.113 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Because that's going to be like hole
zero, one, two, three, four,

00:03:23.113 --> 00:03:28.008 line:100% position:50% align:middle
all the way up till five. So idx, then
let's just console log the hole itself.

00:03:28.008 --> 00:03:36.640 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So now if we run that function by passing
it our holes, this is five.

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:40.510 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Oh, five again, that's going to be a
problem for us. One, one,

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:43.380 line:100% position:50% align:middle
oh, one again, that's going to be a
problem for us. One again,

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:48.590 line:100% position:50% align:middle
what are the chances? I guess one in six.
Hole, three, hole two.

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:53.150 line:100% position:50% align:middle
You see how it's giving us a random one.
But the problem that we're running into is

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:57.520 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that sometimes we get the same one,
it's a one and six chance,

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:01.990 line:100% position:50% align:middle
so it's going to be pretty common, and you
don't want the same mole popping up.

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:05.130 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So what we're going to do is we're
going to create a variable up here,

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:10.670 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we're going to say "let lastHole;" and
that's just going to create a variable.

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:15.480 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And then down here we're going to say, at
the very bottom put a line in between

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:21.150 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that, we'll say "lastHole = hole;" and
what this will do is it will save the

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:26.590 line:100% position:50% align:middle
reference to what one got popped up last
time this function was called so that in

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:32.950 line:100% position:50% align:middle
here what we can do it we'll say, "if(hole
= lastHole)" like if it was the same

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:40.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
one that popped up last time, we'll just
console log "Ah nah that's the same one

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:47.796 line:100% position:50% align:middle
bud." And then we'll simply just run this
function "randomHole()" again by passing

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:53.110 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"holes." Now this function is just console
logging but that's not really what we want

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:57.740 line:100% position:50% align:middle
because we can't get the reference to the
DOM node if we just consolel log it.

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:03.100 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So what we need to do here is return the
hole which is what we have,

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:08.420 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and then up here if it was the same one
we'll just return that function itself

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:12.680 line:100% position:50% align:middle
which will in turn get called. So you've
got some recursion going on here returning

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:18.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the hole. Now if we rerun that we should
never get the same one twice in a row.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.770 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So, oh, we've got two things going on
here, why do we? Oh, because we are

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:24.630 line:100% position:50% align:middle
running it and we're console logging
it, and that's...so this one,

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:27.490 line:100% position:50% align:middle
this little thing is saying it's returned
and we're console logging,

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:32.370 line:100% position:50% align:middle
so we can take that console log out and
run it, we have one, two,

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:37.540 line:100% position:50% align:middle
three, two, six, three. There we go, never
getting the same one,

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:40.980 line:100% position:50% align:middle
every now and then we're getting,
"now that's a same one, bud." Why?

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:44.740 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Because it's, it is, in this case it was
one and then it found one again,

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:49.190 line:100% position:50% align:middle
but rather than returning it, it just
returned the function which will call

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:53.340 line:100% position:50% align:middle
itself again. If you call that a few more
times you might get a chance where it will

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:58.830 line:100% position:50% align:middle
run it more than once. Aha, there we go,
see, it ran it once, it had one,

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:03.840 line:100% position:50% align:middle
ran it again and got one, ran it again and
got one, and then ran it again and got

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:06.820 line:100% position:50% align:middle
three. So we've got them running now.
So we've got a random time,

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:10.780 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we got a random hole, maybe we should
rename this to "randomTime",

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:16.390 line:100% position:50% align:middle
keep that consistent, random and
"randomHole." Next what we need to do is

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:22.330 line:100% position:50% align:middle
actually get the moles popping up. So
we'll go here and we'll make a function

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:26.290 line:100% position:50% align:middle
called "peep()" which is, there're going
to go hoop, they're going to pop up from

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:30.600 line:100% position:50% align:middle
their holes. And we will get some time,
which is a random time,

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:36.540 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it's going to be between 200 miliseconds
and one second, and we're going to get a

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:44.190 line:100% position:50% align:middle
random hole which should give us
"randomHole()" we pass it "holes." So now

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:53.030 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we just console log time and hole see what
we got here. Now when I just run "peep" we

00:06:53.030 --> 00:07:01.660 line:100% position:50% align:middle
get 450 milliseconds, hole5 should pop up,
hole4 should pop up for 821 milliseconds,

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:06.740 line:100% position:50% align:middle
hole3 should be just under one second. So
you see how we're getting a random hole

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:11.900 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and a random amount of time? So what we'll
do here is we'll take that hole,

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:21.970 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we'll add a class to it of "up" and that
is going to trigger our CSS to be "top:0;"

00:07:21.970 --> 00:07:25.910 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and that's just going to animate itself in
because by default I have put them

00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:32.380 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"top:100%;" and I put a transition
of 0.4 seconds to pop up on it.

00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:39.990 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So there we go, let's try this here.
Hey, there he is. I'll do it again,

00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:44.520 line:100% position:50% align:middle
hey, and again, and again, and again, and
again, and you see that they are all

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:49.880 line:100% position:50% align:middle
slowly popping up. However, we
don't...they don't go away, and what we

00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:55.670 line:100% position:50% align:middle
need to do now is after this random amount
of time we need to remove the class of

00:07:55.670 --> 00:08:02.760 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"up" from this random hole. So
"setTimeout()" which is after how many

00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:10.140 line:100% position:50% align:middle
seconds time? And when that happens we're
going to take our hole and we're going to

00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:17.953 line:100% position:50% align:middle
remove the class of "up." No, not remove
class, just remove...removeClass is

00:08:17.953 --> 00:08:22.860 line:100% position:50% align:middle
jQuery. So here we go, and I will say peep
and then it goes down,

00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:27.990 line:100% position:50% align:middle
peep again and then it goes down, peep
again, wohoo! Having some fun here,

00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:36.480 line:100% position:50% align:middle
awesome. Then, what we need to do is
unless the game is over we just need to

00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:40.890 line:100% position:50% align:middle
run it again, when it's done we'll run
"peep()." So if you were to kick off

00:08:40.890 --> 00:08:48.170 line:100% position:50% align:middle
peep like that it's just going to run
indefinitely because there's no way to

00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:53.550 line:100% position:50% align:middle
actually stop that. So what we'll do here
is we'll go up to our top,

00:08:53.550 --> 00:08:59.530 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and we'll create a variable called
"timeUp" and we'll set that to "false,"

00:08:59.530 --> 00:09:05.800 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and we'll go down here and we'll say if
the time is not up then we'll run

00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:13.420 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"peep()." So if there is the variable
"timeUp" is ever set to "true" then it

00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:18.130 line:100% position:50% align:middle
will stop. So here we go, we'll run
"peep()", it's going to run forever but

00:09:18.130 --> 00:09:22.820 line:100% position:50% align:middle
then we're going to take this "timeUp"
variable, it's set to "false," we can set

00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:28.790 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it to "true," and it never starts again
because it just...well,

00:09:28.790 --> 00:09:33.400 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"peep()" will call itself and then it'll
call itself for the last time because this

00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:40.460 line:100% position:50% align:middle
will not run. Okay, that makes sense so
far. Then what we need to do is make a

00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:44.937 line:100% position:50% align:middle
function called "startGame." So we'll say
"function startGame()." And the first

00:09:44.937 --> 00:09:48.570 line:100% position:50% align:middle
thing we need to do is just reset the
scoreboard here, just in case we're

00:09:48.570 --> 00:09:56.104 line:100% position:50% align:middle
playing again. So we'll say
"scoreboard.textContent = 0;" then we'll

00:09:56.104 --> 00:10:00.816 line:100% position:50% align:middle
say "timeUp = false;" again we set that on
page load I know, but if you were to

00:10:00.816 --> 00:10:04.920 line:100% position:50% align:middle
run "startGame()" again like you want to
play twice then you could do that.

00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:09.860 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Then we want to kick off "peep()" there
which we'll run it, so let's see here,

00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:16.920 line:100% position:50% align:middle
startGame(), so they're running like
crazy. But what we also want to do is

00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:21.800 line:100% position:50% align:middle
after 10 seconds we want to set that
variable that we time up,

00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:28.820 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we want to set it to true. So
"setTimeout()" after that happens we'll

00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:37.420 line:100% position:50% align:middle
say "timeUp = true" and that will run
after 10 seconds, 10,000 milliseconds.

00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:42.170 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Well, let's do it after two seconds now
just so we can see if it works.

00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:49.300 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we'll run it, two seconds has
elapsed and no longer is running.

00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:53.410 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Good, so we'll set that back to 10
seconds. So we've got our "startGame(),"

00:10:53.410 --> 00:11:00.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we've got our "peep()" and we can make a
button now that when clicked we can maybe

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:07.550 line:100% position:50% align:middle
put a button right here that says
"onClick="startGame()"" there's "Start!"

00:11:07.550 --> 00:11:11.480 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and then when you click it it will start
playing the game for you.

00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:16.020 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Wohoo! The last piece that we need
is when you click on a mole,

00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:21.030 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we need to bonk them on the head. So we
are going to make a function called "bonk"

00:11:21.030 --> 00:11:24.770 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that's going to take in the event, it'll
just console log the event.

00:11:24.770 --> 00:11:31.740 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Then we'll take all of our moles and we'll
listen for a click on each of the moles,

00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:39.270 line:100% position:50% align:middle
then we'll run "bonk." Bonk, like that. So
now we have to get a little bit crafty

00:11:39.270 --> 00:11:44.780 line:100% position:50% align:middle
with our clicking. So, start it, click.
Oh, I got the first one.

00:11:44.780 --> 00:11:50.040 line:100% position:50% align:middle
All right, let's take a look at this.
"MouseEvent", all kinds of information in

00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:53.230 line:100% position:50% align:middle
here. The first thing I want you to do is,
you might say like,

00:11:53.230 --> 00:11:58.830 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"Oh, Wes, but I can fake a click with
JavaScript," good matches like do that

00:11:58.830 --> 00:12:04.170 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and win the entire game. Well, on all of
your events you have this thing called

00:12:04.170 --> 00:12:10.880 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"isTrusted" and it will say "true." If you
fake clicking something with JavaScript

00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:15.060 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that's going to be false because you can
simulate a click which is handy in some

00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:19.860 line:100% position:50% align:middle
cases, but we need it to be true that this
actually came from the user's mouse input.

00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:25.200 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So the first thing we're going to do is
we're going to say "if(!e.isTrusted)

00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:31.200 line:100% position:50% align:middle
return;" and that will...we'll just say
"cheater!" So someone's

00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:36.830 line:100% position:50% align:middle
trying to fake the click without their
mouse. Okay, good. Then what we want to do

00:12:36.830 --> 00:12:41.950 line:100% position:50% align:middle
here is when someone clicks something
we've got to give them some sort of score.

00:12:41.950 --> 00:12:49.140 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So let's go up to the top here and we'll
say, "let score = 0" and when we start the

00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:55.700 line:100% position:50% align:middle
game we'll set score to zero as well just
so that if we restart it we can do that.

00:12:55.700 --> 00:13:01.290 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And then we'll go down here and we'll
simply say "score++;" and we will move

00:13:01.290 --> 00:13:06.400 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that little guy down, so
"this.classList.remove('up');" because if

00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:11.240 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you smack them they should move down even
if they have like a second or so left on

00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:14.910 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the clock. And then we take our
"scoreBoard" which have we selected that?

00:13:14.910 --> 00:13:20.424 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Yes, yes we have "document.querySelctor"
and we'll set the text content to be

00:13:20.424 --> 00:13:26.280 line:100% position:50% align:middle
[inaudible]. I got eight, then
you click start, it'll run again and you

00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:31.630 line:100% position:50% align:middle
can keep playing with all of your values
there. So that is our Whack-a-mole game,

00:13:31.630 --> 00:13:34.790 line:100% position:50% align:middle
there's a lot more you could do. First of
all what would be really be cool is if you

00:13:34.790 --> 00:13:39.440 line:100% position:50% align:middle
had like an all time scoreboard and you
were to save that in local storage so if

00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:43.580 line:100% position:50% align:middle
someone were to come back then you
could reload the highest score,

00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:47.630 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and you save them in local storage. It
would also be cool if you had like levels,

00:13:47.630 --> 00:13:53.820 line:100% position:50% align:middle
like this is like a pretty clickable, but
if you were to say like expert level,

00:13:53.820 --> 00:14:00.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and then you were to change this random
time to like between 50 milliseconds and

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:04.060 line:100% position:50% align:middle
300 milliseconds and then it'll be like
super hard like woo, woo,

00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:07.250 line:100% position:50% align:middle
woo, woo, woo. Like some people would
be really good at that, not me,

00:14:07.250 --> 00:14:12.940 line:100% position:50% align:middle
but oh I got one, sweet. So you could do
expert mode and you can just create extra

00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:16.420 line:100% position:50% align:middle
all kinds of different controls up here
along with the dashboard and I would just

00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:22.680 line:100% position:50% align:middle
love to see where you take this one.
Hopefully you enjoyed that and I won't see

00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:26.190 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you tomorrow because that is it. Hopefully
you enjoyed it and I'll have a little bit

00:14:26.190 --> 00:14:29.350 line:100% position:50% align:middle
of an outro video for you as well.
Thanks a lot.
