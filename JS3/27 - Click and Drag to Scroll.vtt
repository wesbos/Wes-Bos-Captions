00:00:07.074 --> 00:00:11.460 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Today we're going to learn how to do click
and drag from scratch.

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.510 line:100% position:50% align:middle
This is an effect that I saw on this
website Hover States. I scroll down to the

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:19.200 line:100% position:50% align:middle
bottom here and I noticed that
you can scroll this if you want,

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.600 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it's just a horizontally scrolling div,
which is kind of cool because it works

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:27.930 line:100% position:50% align:middle
without Javascript. However, you can also
take your cursor, click and drag as you

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.620 line:100% position:50% align:middle
want to go through it and I thought that
was kind of a cool effect.

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:35.760 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So, that's what I would like to do here is
when you click, drag your mouse and go

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:41.310 line:100% position:50% align:middle
somewhere, we want it to sort of come
along with it and this whole mouse event

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:44.130 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and mouse positioning stuff, I find it to
be a little bit complicated,

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:48.620 line:100% position:50% align:middle
so I thought that this would be a really
nice exercise to get us comfortable with

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:52.480 line:100% position:50% align:middle
what's going on here. So, pretty simple,
what we've got going on here,

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:57.420 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we've got our style that's CSS, I've added
some sort of fun CSS to it,

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.340 line:100% position:50% align:middle
like when you click it, we add a class of
active and it will bring it up a little

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:10.590 line:100% position:50% align:middle
bit. And then I also used this rotate y
and a perspective, so that when you move

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.820 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it, you see how 17 is "oh, I can barely
see it, oh, now it's totally looking at

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.980 line:100% position:50% align:middle
us." Just some fun stuff, it has nothing
to do with it other than it looks pretty.

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:24.660 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So, let's go down to our script here. And
really what we want to be doing here is

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:29.970 line:100% position:50% align:middle
selecting the items, which is this white
box right here and then we're going to be

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.820 line:100% position:50% align:middle
listening for a number of different
events. So, when I first click down,

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.480 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we're gonna add a class of active and
we're gonna figure out where did I click

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:42.950 line:100% position:50% align:middle
down. Then when I move my mouse
either to the left or to the right,

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:49.790 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we're gonna figure out okay, let's say if
I click right here. This is 500 px and if

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:55.340 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I scroll to the left, 20 px, we know that
we should scroll the div 20 pixels.

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.840 line:100% position:50% align:middle
If I scroll to the right 20 pixels, we
know that we should scroll the div 20

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.910 line:100% position:50% align:middle
pixels that way. And that's really how
it's going to work, we're just going to

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:07.650 line:100% position:50% align:middle
anchor it down as soon as we click and
then depending on how far either way we

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:11.760 line:100% position:50% align:middle
scroll, that's how much we're going to be
scrolling the div or we can do it a

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.600 line:100% position:50% align:middle
multiple of that, if you'd like for the
scrolling to go a little bit bigger.

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.870 line:100% position:50% align:middle
It's just a combination of mouse down,
mouse leave, mouse out,

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.830 line:100% position:50% align:middle
up and mouse move. So, let's first go
ahead and grab the sliders so we say const

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:28.100 line:100% position:50% align:middle
sliders equals document.query
selector. We are going to look for the

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:32.850 line:100% position:50% align:middle
item, that's the white div that surrounds
everything. And then we need a couple of

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:35.570 line:100% position:50% align:middle
variables, they're all gonna be let
because they're gonna be updated.

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:39.390 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we're going to say let is down, to
build a false. That's gonna be our flag

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.550 line:100% position:50% align:middle
variable, that's either gonna be true or
false, depending on if I'm clicking or if

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:48.700 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I'm not. And then we also need one
called start x and scroll left, so we say

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:55.800 line:100% position:50% align:middle
let start x and let scroll left. You'll
notice how I'm not assigning any values to

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:59.410 line:100% position:50% align:middle
them, because that's gonna be happening in
our events. And we'll understand exactly

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:04.900 line:100% position:50% align:middle
what these are in just a second. Then what
we need to do is attach a whole bunch of

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.630 line:100% position:50% align:middle
different listeners, so we're gonna be
working with mouse down,

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:13.020 line:100% position:50% align:middle
mouse leave, mouse up and mouse move.
And I've paced these in here.

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:17.800 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And we're gonna listen for an event on
each of them, so we're just gonna say

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:29.280 line:100% position:50% align:middle
slider.add event listener. And you can
farm these off to separate functions.

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.800 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I'm gonna do them in line just because
right now I think it's important that we

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:36.470 line:100% position:50% align:middle
attach the code that is happening
directly to the event. However,

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:39.730 line:100% position:50% align:middle
once you're done it would be great to
refactor those out into separate functions

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:42.970 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and then just pass them into your event
listener, like we've been doing with a lot

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:47.960 line:100% position:50% align:middle
of our videos so far. We've got mouse down
mouse leave, mouse up and mouse move.

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:53.960 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So first let's handle the is down that's
happening. So when someone mouses down,

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:59.850 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we're gonna take this is down variable,
set it to true. When someone leaves,

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:05.150 line:100% position:50% align:middle
so if I'm dragging here, and then
I leave this thing and come back,

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:08.930 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it shouldn't work because what happens is
someone leaves, they come back,

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:12.350 line:100% position:50% align:middle
they let go and then they come back here
and it's still in the down state,

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:20.750 line:100% position:50% align:middle
so what we need to then do is to take this
is down and set that to be false.

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:25.030 line:100% position:50% align:middle
When someone mouses up, we want
to set that to be false as well.

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:29.830 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And then in mouse move, that's where all
of our magic is going to happen,

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:36.410 line:100% position:50% align:middle
so let's just inside of that, console log
is down. And then we're gonna console log

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:40.490 line:100% position:50% align:middle
do work. Open that up, open up your
console, I want to see what's going on

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:46.140 line:100% position:50% align:middle
here. And you see like, I'm console
logging a lot here and I haven't even

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:52.390 line:100% position:50% align:middle
clicked anything. This console logging
shouldn't show anything at all unless I'm

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:55.980 line:100% position:50% align:middle
actually mouse down. And if I click it
and mouse around me says true,

00:04:55.980 --> 00:05:00.030 line:100% position:50% align:middle
true, true, I let go, false, false, false.
So what we want to do first thing here is

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:05.850 line:100% position:50% align:middle
in our mouse move, we'll say if is not
down, we are just going to return.

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:10.890 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And what that will do is stop the function
from running and then this console log is

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:15.880 line:100% position:50% align:middle
down and do work won't get logged unless
you're clicked in the click state.

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:20.940 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Here we go, let go, let me clear this out.
See I'm moving around,

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:24.700 line:100% position:50% align:middle
nothing, nothing, nothing? Click down,
move around, it starts to work.

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:30.559 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Let go, there's no updated. And we could
console.log, if you change that to

00:05:30.559 --> 00:05:34.380 line:100% position:50% align:middle
console.count and just to see how many
times that happens. None, none, none,

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:39.130 line:100% position:50% align:middle
drag, drag, drag, good. Then it stops,
then it goes again. Good,

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:43.800 line:100% position:50% align:middle
so we have that mouse down. Next thing I
want to do is we'll take the slider.

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:47.020 line:100% position:50% align:middle
When you mouse down. We're
gonna take slider.add event listener.

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:55.080 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Nope. We'll take the slider, class
list.add, active, then we'll also do that

00:05:55.080 --> 00:06:02.170 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the opposite when someone leaves, so
remove, and then once my mouse is up,

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:06.725 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it'll also remove class of act, good.
So now when you click it,

00:06:06.725 --> 00:06:11.566 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you see it get a little bit of effect
there. Why is that happening?

00:06:11.566 --> 00:06:14.920 line:100% position:50% align:middle
That's happening because if you look
at our style, that CSS.

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:20.200 line:100% position:50% align:middle
When we have a class of active,
I just change the background,

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:23.950 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I change the cursor. You have to change it
to... I didn't even know you had to

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:28.400 line:100% position:50% align:middle
vendor prefix cursor, it's been a
while since I've seen that.

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:33.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And then transform the scale up to one, so
it goes from 98 percent to one.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.830 line:100% position:50% align:middle
It just gives you a little bit of a cool
effect that goes in and out.

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:41.820 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now let's think about how this is going to
work. When I click down here and I drag 20

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:46.810 line:100% position:50% align:middle
pixels to the left or 20 pixels to the
right, we need to know where that anchor

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:52.210 line:100% position:50% align:middle
point is when I scroll to the left or to
the right. Because as many times as I move

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:59.360 line:100% position:50% align:middle
around, until I unclick or mouse up, we
need to know where that initial click down

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:04.170 line:100% position:50% align:middle
was. And that's what that start x variable
is for, where we created right here.

00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:07.950 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So when someone clicks down, before they
start moving to the left or to the right,

00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:12.340 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we need to record where they did that
initial click down. That's going to happen

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:17.460 line:100% position:50% align:middle
in our mouse down here. And we're going to
go up to our function and past the event.

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:21.440 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now, if we're to console log that event,
let's see what information we get on

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:25.240 line:100% position:50% align:middle
there. Yeah, I got the mouse event,
I got all kinds of information.

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:31.730 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Client x, client y, etc., etc. One way to
tell where we clicked inside of it and

00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:38.970 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we've done a couple of different ways in
this series is to console log e.page x.

00:07:38.970 --> 00:07:43.780 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And then it's going to tell us exactly
three, nine, six. It's telling us exactly

00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:50.440 line:100% position:50% align:middle
what the x coordinates on the actual page.
However, if there was some margin in

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:55.680 line:100% position:50% align:middle
between this item here, like margin 50 px.
If we really brought it out,

00:07:55.680 --> 00:08:00.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
then that would be off. We need to know
where did they click inside of this thing,

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.610 line:100% position:50% align:middle
not on the page. So we just take
start x is equal to e.page x,

00:08:04.610 --> 00:08:10.580 line:100% position:50% align:middle
but then we'll attract the slider.offset
left and that will just offset it.

00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:16.180 line:100% position:50% align:middle
If there's 50 px of margin in between the
page and the item that we care about,

00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:21.480 line:100% position:50% align:middle
then subtracting it will handle that
offset for us. So then we can console log

00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:26.690 line:100% position:50% align:middle
start x and if I click here, we should
get a really low number, 18.

00:08:26.690 --> 00:08:30.670 line:100% position:50% align:middle
If I click over here, we'll get a high
number, good. Then,

00:08:30.670 --> 00:08:35.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
what's important about that is when we
move our mouse, we should be able to

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:42.500 line:100% position:50% align:middle
console log start x over and over. See
it's 645 regardless of where I'm moving my

00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:46.180 line:100% position:50% align:middle
actual cursor here, that's pretty cool.
And then when I let go,

00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:51.090 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we don't really care about it. We click
again, now it's 547, we care about that.

00:08:51.090 --> 00:08:55.820 line:100% position:50% align:middle
The other thing we need to log at
the time of click is the scroll.

00:08:55.820 --> 00:08:59.860 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Because let's say I'm scrolled 200
pixels in and then I want to

00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:04.798 line:100% position:50% align:middle
scroll to the left and to the right of
this div. Then we need to figure out

00:09:04.798 --> 00:09:09.563 line:100% position:50% align:middle
where the initial scroll was when we
started it. And that's what this other

00:09:09.563 --> 00:09:11.872 line:100% position:50% align:middle
variable is for, which is scroll left.

00:09:11.872 --> 00:09:18.485 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we'll take this, we'll say scroll
left is equal to slider.scroll left.

00:09:18.485 --> 00:09:21.770 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And the reason why we're going to
keep that in a variable is because it's

00:09:21.770 --> 00:09:25.280 line:100% position:50% align:middle
going to move. If I go to the
answer here, it's going to move,

00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:28.980 line:100% position:50% align:middle
but we always need to go back
to that initial state when it started,

00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:33.800 line:100% position:50% align:middle
when you did that first click down. We got
our start x and we got our scroll left,

00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:39.280 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we can take these console logs out of
here. Good. Now we'll go down to our mouse

00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:46.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
move and start doing the work. So first of
all, I'd like to take the event and then

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:51.940 line:100% position:50% align:middle
just call an e.prevent default on it. And
that will stop any selecting of text

00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:56.560 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that's inside of there or any of the
sliding to the left or any other weird

00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:59.670 line:100% position:50% align:middle
stuff that the browser might think you're
actually trying to select some text,

00:09:59.670 --> 00:10:06.830 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that will stop it for us. Then what we
need to do is figure out where the cursor

00:10:06.830 --> 00:10:10.990 line:100% position:50% align:middle
is when they moved it. We already know
where the cursor is when they initially

00:10:10.990 --> 00:10:15.190 line:100% position:50% align:middle
clicked down, but we want to know where
the cursor is when they move it to the

00:10:15.190 --> 00:10:24.350 line:100% position:50% align:middle
left and to the right. So we'll say const
x is equal to e.page x minus slider.offset

00:10:24.350 --> 00:10:28.550 line:100% position:50% align:middle
left. That's the exact same code that we
just used up here. Here we're using it to

00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:31.837 line:100% position:50% align:middle
say where did they initially click and
here we're going to recalculate every

00:10:31.837 --> 00:10:39.446 line:100% position:50% align:middle
single time that we move the mouse. So now
if we just console.log x as well as what

00:10:39.446 --> 00:10:45.257 line:100% position:50% align:middle
was that other one called here? Start x.
And a little tip here, if you want to know

00:10:45.340 --> 00:10:50.440 line:100% position:50% align:middle
what those variables are, just throw them
in an object and you'll see the values.

00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:56.280 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now, when I click in the middle here, you
see that the x value is changing and the

00:10:56.280 --> 00:11:03.670 line:100% position:50% align:middle
start x is not changing at all. So we can
simply then take that and I'm going to

00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:11.570 line:100% position:50% align:middle
call that the wok. Const wok is equal to,
we'll take the x value and subtract the

00:11:11.570 --> 00:11:17.530 line:100% position:50% align:middle
start x. And this is going to tell us how
far have we deviated from that initial

00:11:17.530 --> 00:11:24.150 line:100% position:50% align:middle
space. Console log wok, get rid of that
initial console log and now we're seeing,

00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:29.380 line:100% position:50% align:middle
ah, look at that! So I'm going to click
here. I'm going to move 20 pixels to the

00:11:29.380 --> 00:11:34.620 line:100% position:50% align:middle
right. So we've gone 20 pixels to the
right. Then I'm going to go back and 20

00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:38.570 line:100% position:50% align:middle
pixels to the left gives me negative. So
it's telling us, how far have we deviated

00:11:38.570 --> 00:11:42.510 line:100% position:50% align:middle
from that initial point, which we could
put like a red dot there when you clicked,

00:11:42.510 --> 00:11:47.301 line:100% position:50% align:middle
because then you can see exactly how far
to the left and to the right you are

00:11:47.301 --> 00:11:53.030 line:100% position:50% align:middle
working. So next up, what we need to
actually do is change this div here to

00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:58.980 line:100% position:50% align:middle
scroll and we do that with a scroll left
property. So we'll say slider.scroll left

00:11:58.980 --> 00:12:02.370 line:100% position:50% align:middle
is equal to...now you might think,
okay, we'll just set it to wok and

00:12:02.370 --> 00:12:03.730 line:100% position:50% align:middle
let's see what that does for us.

00:12:09.438 --> 00:12:12.463 line:100% position:50% align:middle
It kind of works, but it's really jumpy.

00:12:12.463 --> 00:12:16.890 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And the problem is that is we're
recalculating the scroll left every single

00:12:16.890 --> 00:12:23.330 line:100% position:50% align:middle
time. So the reason why we captured the
scroll left value when we did that initial

00:12:23.330 --> 00:12:26.870 line:100% position:50% align:middle
click is so we could reference it inside
of this function. So we'll take

00:12:26.870 --> 00:12:32.410 line:100% position:50% align:middle
slider.scroll left, set it to the scroll
left value, which is what we initially

00:12:32.410 --> 00:12:36.170 line:100% position:50% align:middle
captured, we've put it in a variable
and then we minus the wok value.

00:12:36.170 --> 00:12:41.300 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We give that a save here and now we should
be able to click and drag beautifully back

00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:44.910 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and forth. If you feel like this is a lot
of work just to get over,

00:12:44.910 --> 00:12:49.570 line:100% position:50% align:middle
what you can then do is put this in
parenthesis and then multiply it by like

00:12:49.570 --> 00:12:54.180 line:100% position:50% align:middle
three or something. So for every pixel
moved, you're gonna scroll the slider

00:12:54.180 --> 00:13:01.070 line:100% position:50% align:middle
three pixels. There you get a bit of a
nice slider effect as we're going on in

00:13:01.070 --> 00:13:07.360 line:100% position:50% align:middle
there. So I think that's it for what we've
got going on here, looking pretty good.

00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:12.766 line:100% position:50% align:middle
It's a simple ISH code, however actually
building this the first time took me

00:13:12.766 --> 00:13:16.973 line:100% position:50% align:middle
a while to understand. "Oh, you need to
put these variables, you need to capture

00:13:16.973 --> 00:13:20.575 line:100% position:50% align:middle
them at the time of your mouse down and
then reference them whenever someone

00:13:20.575 --> 00:13:25.626 line:100% position:50% align:middle
moves the mouse." So hopefully you
enjoyed that. Obviously there's a lot more

00:13:25.626 --> 00:13:29.456 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to libraries, if you take a look at this
one right here, you can just flick it

00:13:29.456 --> 00:13:33.731 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and you don't have to worry. It really
gives me appreciation for people who

00:13:33.731 --> 00:13:38.813 line:100% position:50% align:middle
build bouncy scrolling and inertial
scrolling, you see how like it fades

00:13:38.813 --> 00:13:42.902 line:100% position:50% align:middle
out at the end. There's a lot of math that
goes into building these different

00:13:42.902 --> 00:13:46.961 line:100% position:50% align:middle
libraries. But it's really important to
know how they're working under the hood

00:13:46.961 --> 00:13:48.947 line:100% position:50% align:middle
in case you ever wanted
to build your own.

00:13:48.947 --> 00:13:53.360 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I should also note that with this mouse
down, mouse leave, mouse up,

00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:58.170 line:100% position:50% align:middle
mouse move dance that we've done here, you
can also implement your own drag and drop,

00:13:58.170 --> 00:14:00.750 line:100% position:50% align:middle
so if that's something you're interested
in doing, I would challenge you to do

00:14:00.750 --> 00:14:03.003 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that. Thanks a lot, I'll see you tomorrow.

00:14:03.564 --> 00:14:06.854 line:100% position:50% align:middle
