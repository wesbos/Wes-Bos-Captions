00:00:07.546 --> 00:00:11.020 line:100% position:50% align:middle
A couple weeks ago Stripe launched
this new page and I hovered over the

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:16.560 line:100% position:50% align:middle
navigation and I was
like, "Whoa. How are they doing that?"

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.790 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Because you know if you have a drop down
and you hide one and show the other,

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:24.930 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you can't just transition the background.
You can't just move the unordered list

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.510 line:100% position:50% align:middle
from one to another, because it's two
different elements. So, I figured out how

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:33.710 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to do it, and we're going to build a
replica of this in a coming video.

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.260 line:100% position:50% align:middle
But what I wanted to do was start with
something simple, just so we can get the

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.020 line:100% position:50% align:middle
ideas. Because it's a bit of a doozy. They
obviously have some really good developers

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:44.410 line:100% position:50% align:middle
at Stripe to build this thing. But I
really want to understand, sort of,

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:47.920 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the fundamentals of what's happening. So,
this is what we're going to start with,

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.100 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and then in a couple videos down the road,
we're going to replicate this sort of

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.320 line:100% position:50% align:middle
thing with the Stripe navigation.

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.600 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So, here's what we're doing. We've got
these links on the page,

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.850 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and when you hover over one of the links,
we've got this little pill that's going to

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:07.690 line:100% position:50% align:middle
both resize itself, so it's short and
long, as well as follow you around the

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:13.400 line:100% position:50% align:middle
page wherever that is going. So let's
open up our index-start and get going.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.130 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Go down to our script tag here. So, first
thing that we need to do,

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.830 line:100% position:50% align:middle
is to get all of what I like to call
triggers. Things that will be hovered,

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:26.810 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that need a background behind it. So I'm
just going to do every single link that's

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:27.580 line:100% position:50% align:middle
on the page.

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:33.310 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So it's "const triggers =
document.query selector all A."

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:37.320 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Every single link on the actual page. Then
what we need to do is create what's called

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.160 line:100% position:50% align:middle
a highlight. Because if you haven't
figured it out yet, how does this actually

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:46.870 line:100% position:50% align:middle
work? If we inspect it here, and we look
at our DOM, you're going to see that we

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:51.350 line:100% position:50% align:middle
have the span with a class of highlight,
that I've just tacked into the DOM here.

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:57.010 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And when you highlight over something, it
will figure out the width,

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:02.120 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the height, and where on the page that
actual item is. And because there's CSS

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:07.110 line:100% position:50% align:middle
transitions on this element, it's just
going to transition itself from place,

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:12.230 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to place, to place. And the width, the
height, and the transform translate X,

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:17.680 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and translate Y values, are gong to
be moved on over.

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.800 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we will first make that highlight
ourself, rather than having to go into our

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:27.400 line:100% position:50% align:middle
HTML and do it we're going to make it in
there. So, we'll say "const highlight

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.120 line:100% position:50% align:middle
= document.create element." And we're
going to make a span.

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:37.910 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We're going to add a class of highlight,
and then we're going to put it into the

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:40.210 line:100% position:50% align:middle
DOM.

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:44.330 line:100% position:50% align:middle
When we open this up in our browser here,
you actually won't see that highlight

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.440 line:100% position:50% align:middle
anywhere, and it's because it does not
have a width or a height or anything like

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:52.270 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that. But if we inspect, you should see
that we do actually have this highlight

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:59.340 line:100% position:50% align:middle
element in here. Good. Now what we need to
do is listen for someone enters into a

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:05.245 line:100% position:50% align:middle
link. So we'll make a function called,
let's call it highlight link.

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:11.010 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And we'll just console.log highlight. And
then we'll listen for the mouse enter

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.630 line:100% position:50% align:middle
event on each of our triggers.

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:18.720 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Triggers.for each and then take our link,
and we're going to take the link and we're

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:24.160 line:100% position:50% align:middle
going to add the event listener for mouse
enter. And when that happens we are gong

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:29.890 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to run the function highlight link.
Good. Now let's try it out.

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:35.160 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Console highlight over it, there we go.
We've got highlight triggering on all of

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:39.220 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the links on the page. And you can tell
that by console logging this.

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:43.470 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And you'll see it will log the actual link
that we're looking for.

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:48.850 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Good. So, we've got that working so far.
But now, what needs to happen is we need

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:53.410 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to figure out the width, the height, the X
and the Y. We need to figure out how big

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:59.470 line:100% position:50% align:middle
is the element that we hovered? And where
on the page is that actual element?

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:04.820 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So, we're going to use a method called
"get bounding client rect,"

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:09.900 line:100% position:50% align:middle
which is a bit of a mouthful to say. But
we'll say const link coords,

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:14.100 line:100% position:50% align:middle
this is going to give us the coordinates,
and this, this is going to be equal to the

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:17.170 line:100% position:50% align:middle
thing that was triggered, which is going
to be each of the links.

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:23.820 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Dot get, bounding client rect. And then
just console log those link coords to see

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:26.450 line:100% position:50% align:middle
what we have here.

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:30.607 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So I'm going to hover over this sucker. Ah
and look what we get here.

00:04:30.607 --> 00:04:35.280 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We get the client rect. We've got the
bottom, the height, the left,

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:39.500 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the right, the top and the width. So it
gives us all the information about where

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:44.940 line:100% position:50% align:middle
on the page does that thing actually live.
Now that we have those coordinates here,

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:50.472 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we can simply take our highlight element,
and we can apply the style.width

00:04:50.472 --> 00:04:57.410 line:100% position:50% align:middle
is gong to be equal to, and we'll
take the link coords.width and you need to

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:02.320 line:100% position:50% align:middle
put on PX on the end, otherwise it's just
going to be 399 or 409 or something that

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:07.820 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we don't know. And we'll do that also with
the height. Let's see where we're at with

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:11.960 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that. Hover one of these. Okay, so that
matches up. And then when you go from one

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:16.030 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to another, it's dynamically applying the
style to it.

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:20.090 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And if you go to our style.css and you
look for the highlight selector,

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:26.180 line:100% position:50% align:middle
.highlight, there we go. We have this
transition on here of 0.2 seconds.

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:32.310 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So in order to change that to two seconds,
you'll see that it will just change itself

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:36.860 line:100% position:50% align:middle
over that amount of time. And like, these
links are a little bit shorter than these

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:40.680 line:100% position:50% align:middle
links. So it will grow both in width and
height. So that is why.

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:44.220 line:100% position:50% align:middle
If we didn't have that transition on there
it would just be immediate snaps,

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:49.270 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and that's not what we want. We want it to
animate itself. So where the fun part

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:52.630 line:100% position:50% align:middle
comes in is where we start to animate the
left and the right values.

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:58.610 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And we're going to be doing that. Rather
than doing it with CSS.left and .right,

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:04.100 line:100% position:50% align:middle
or top and bottom, what we will be doing
is we will be using the transform property

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:07.843 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to apply it and that can have some
benefits when you're looking for some

00:06:07.843 --> 00:06:09.300 line:100% position:50% align:middle
really smooth animation.

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:13.250 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So, we'll take our highlight. We'll apply
the style of transform.

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:19.150 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And normally how it works is that we say
something like translate and then you give

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:24.460 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it an X and a Y. So 100 and 100. You see
how it animates itself to 100 100?

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:28.860 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Well, we want to make these 100 and 100
dynamic. But we take our 100,

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:35.750 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and replace it with our variable here. So
we'll say linkcoords.left,

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:40.440 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and this one is going to be
linkcoords.top. And that will give us the

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:44.300 line:100% position:50% align:middle
value right from the top. Now if we hover
over any of these items here,

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:49.750 line:100% position:50% align:middle
everything is looking good. You can also
go up into one of your ones and maybe put

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:53.040 line:100% position:50% align:middle
a break tag in or something to make it
bigger. You can see that it's going to

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:56.330 line:100% position:50% align:middle
transition both the height, the width, and
the X and the Y.

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:59.370 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now, you might think you're done, and a
lot of people do this,

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:04.530 line:100% position:50% align:middle
but they don't try...like open your DEV
tools, and scroll down a little bit.

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:12.150 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now hover over one of them. Oh. What the
hell is going on? They're like a little

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:19.490 line:100% position:50% align:middle
bit messed up. If I scroll down a little
bit, you see how it's off by the amount

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:23.470 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that I've scrolled down? Hmm. That's a
little bit of a pain here.

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:26.970 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And how we compensate for that is, you can
do it in a couple of ways.

00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:31.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
First, we can figure out what the offset
of the actual parent is.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.880 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And we're going to do that in the next
one. But in this case, I think we can just

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:39.600 line:100% position:50% align:middle
simply take how far the person has
scrolled down, and then take that away

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:44.860 line:100% position:50% align:middle
from our actual item. So how do we do
that? Well, let's go into our window here.

00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:50.390 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Window.scroll Y is going to give us zero.
Scroll down a little bit and re-run that.

00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:54.300 line:100% position:50% align:middle
It's going to give you 67. That's how far
we actually are. So,

00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:57.320 line:100% position:50% align:middle
let's go back and refactor this code a
little bit.

00:07:57.320 --> 00:07:59.570 line:100% position:50% align:middle
What I'm going to do is I'm going to make
our own coordinates here.

00:07:59.570 --> 00:08:05.240 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we'll say "const.coords =." It's
going to have a width, which is going to

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:09.940 line:100% position:50% align:middle
be equal to the linkcoords.width. The
width and the height are fine.

00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:16.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Right. But the problem is with our X and
our Y, or our top and our left.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:26.620 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So the top is now going to be
linkcoords.top minus wondow.scroll Y.

00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:31.711 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And then we'll do that for our left which
is link.left and we can also do scroll X

00:08:31.711 --> 00:08:36.080 line:100% position:50% align:middle
just in case we have any horizontal scroll
there. Then what we'll do is we'll switch

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:40.400 line:100% position:50% align:middle
out the reference to link coords, with
just the coords. Object,

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:43.230 line:100% position:50% align:middle
which we've done here. We've done a little
bit of math there.

00:08:43.230 --> 00:08:48.430 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now when I refresh and scroll down a
little bit, it still doesn't work,

00:08:48.430 --> 00:08:54.010 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and that's because I minused them, we
should add them in, not take them away.

00:08:54.010 --> 00:08:58.690 line:100% position:50% align:middle
There we go. Now if I scroll down anywhere
on the page it's always going to follow us

00:08:58.690 --> 00:09:03.360 line:100% position:50% align:middle
along regardless of where we are on the
page. So, that is the very basics.

00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:07.250 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Really, what I wanted to get down there is
this concept of the get bounding client

00:09:07.250 --> 00:09:13.120 line:100% position:50% align:middle
rect, and then applying it to the inline
style. In a couple more videos,
