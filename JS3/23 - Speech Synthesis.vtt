- [Karen] Okay folks, today we are going
to use the browser's Speech Synthesis API

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:20.180 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to create this one bomb diggity
Voiceinator 5000 application. Ready?

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:20.750 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Smiling pile of poo.

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:24.810 line:100% position:50% align:middle
- [Male] All right. I hope you enjoyed
that introduction. What we're going to be

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.800 line:100% position:50% align:middle
working with today is the Speech Synthesis
API that comes in most modern

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:34.870 line:100% position:50% align:middle
browsers. Much like we did Voice to Text a
couple days ago, we're now going to be

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:39.320 line:100% position:50% align:middle
doing Text to Voice. So let's take a quick
look at our HTML that we've got set up

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.700 line:100% position:50% align:middle
here. We've got a select which is going to
contain a list of all of our possible

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.370 line:100% position:50% align:middle
voices. If we look at the answer here,
you'll see them here.

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.010 line:100% position:50% align:middle
There's a lot more. I'm currently
filtering just for the English ones.

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.800 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Then we also have an input with the name
of rate which is going to change...

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.790 line:100% position:50% align:middle
- [Alex] Hello, I love JavaScript. Hello,
I love JavaScript, thumbs up.

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:59.120 line:100% position:50% align:middle
- ...how fast the person talks.

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:00.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
- Hello.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.660 line:100% position:50% align:middle
- You get the point. And we also have
pitch.

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.510 line:100% position:50% align:middle
- Hello.

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:13.170 line:100% position:50% align:middle
- Ah, oh boy. And then finally we've got a
text area with the name of text which is

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.940 line:100% position:50% align:middle
going to contain whatever the person says,
right, we're going to write it in there.

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:20.800 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now, only...the important thing we need to
know there is that rate,

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:26.160 line:100% position:50% align:middle
pitch, and text, the names of all these
inputs here, they are important that they

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:31.380 line:100% position:50% align:middle
are that because the name of them is going
to line up with the property on the

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.590 line:100% position:50% align:middle
utterance which is essentially
the voice that's going to say it,

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.910 line:100% position:50% align:middle
so those are important. Don't change
those. And we've got the stop and speak

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:42.870 line:100% position:50% align:middle
buttons to start and stop it. Now, let's
go down here. I've got you some you

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:48.670 line:100% position:50% align:middle
starter code here. We've got a message
which we're going to create a new speech

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.950 line:100% position:50% align:middle
synthesis utterance and that essentially
means what is the person going to say.

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.350 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And on that utterance, it's going to
contain information about how fast do they

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:02.570 line:100% position:50% align:middle
say it, what is the pitch that they say
it, what is the voice that they say it in,

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:06.800 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and what will they be saying. So all these
four things that we have here,

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:11.970 line:100% position:50% align:middle
those are going to be put onto our
utterance. So we're creating a new version

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.300 line:100% position:50% align:middle
of that into message.

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.890 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We have an empty array here which our
voices are going to be dumped into.

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:22.150 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And then I've just gone ahead and selected
the drop down. I selected the rate,

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:27.490 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the pitch, and the text area all in one
go. I call those options.

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:32.360 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We have the speak button here which is
going to start it and then the other one

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:37.320 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that's going to stop it. Good. So what we
need to now do is on page load,

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.980 line:100% position:50% align:middle
whatever is in this text area, I want to
set that to be the default.

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.770 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So what we'll do here is we'll say
message.text equal to. And normally

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:50.780 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to say hello, testing in here. What we
want to do is we want to select this box

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:56.050 line:100% position:50% align:middle
right here and set it to be whatever is in
there. So we'll say document.querySelector

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:00.810 line:100% position:50% align:middle
where the name is equal to text and we'll
call the value right out of there.

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:06.270 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Give that a save and a refresh, open up
your DevTools here. And if you type in

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:11.980 line:100% position:50% align:middle
M-S-G, you should see that we have our
speech synthesis utterance and the text is

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:16.887 line:100% position:50% align:middle
now equal to, "Hello, I love JavaScript,"
however there is no voice being set

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:23.111 line:100% position:50% align:middle
just yet. So let's go ahead and populate
all the different voices. So what we do

00:03:23.111 --> 00:03:27.706 line:100% position:50% align:middle
is we take a global variable...if this is
a speech synthesis utterance,

00:03:27.706 --> 00:03:30.377 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that's sort of like one thing that
a person might say,

00:03:30.377 --> 00:03:35.073 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we also have another global variable
called speech synthesis.

00:03:35.073 --> 00:03:42.550 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And what speech synthesis will
do is you can call .speak on it and pass

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:46.750 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it an utterance which is going to be our
message. Now, if I were to do that right

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:51.930 line:100% position:50% align:middle
now and try call SpeechSynthesis.speak and
pass it our utterance because the

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:55.420 line:100% position:50% align:middle
utterance is the thing that we say, it
doesn't work just yet and that's because

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:00.230 line:100% position:50% align:middle
there is no voice. But we can take that
global variable which is speech synthesis

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:04.850 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and we can add an Event Listener to it, so
add Event Listener.

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:11.160 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And there is an event called voices
changed. And when that happens,

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.580 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we're going to populate our voices. So
we're going to make a function called

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:18.751 line:100% position:50% align:middle
populateVoices and then right before
that, we'll make that function.

00:04:18.751 --> 00:04:26.420 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Then what we say is we will take that
voices array that we've declared up here

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:32.190 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and we'll just overwrite it with this,
.getVoices. And let's just console.log

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:33.790 line:100% position:50% align:middle
voices and see what we have.

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:38.520 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So when...and this just can't be called on
page load because when speech synthesis

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:44.250 line:100% position:50% align:middle
loads, it has to fire the voices changed
because sometimes it'll take a hot second

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:47.990 line:100% position:50% align:middle
in order for it to load, so we need to
wait until we run the voices changed.

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:53.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So...whoa, look at this. And if you are on
a Windows machine, you might not see as

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.130 line:100% position:50% align:middle
many. The Mac comes with a whole bunch of
voices built in which is pretty fun and

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:03.870 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you can open it up. Each of this is a
voice where they have a name like Alva and

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:10.190 line:100% position:50% align:middle
a language code that they speak in. So
what we want to do is loop over all of

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:15.610 line:100% position:50% align:middle
those speech voices and set them as
options in this drop down.

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:21.550 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we'll say, "const voiceOptions equals,"
we'll take our voices and we'll map over

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:27.380 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it because I like to map over absolutely
everything. Put that on its own line here.

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:31.630 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And we have our voice and from the voice,
we're just going to return an option where

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:37.210 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the value is going to be the voice.name.
And then in there, we're also going to put

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:42.410 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the voice.name, but in brackets. I also
want to put the voice.lang just so you can

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:45.710 line:100% position:50% align:middle
see what language that
voice is meant to be.

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:49.150 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And then once you've done that, we
we click join on it and then

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:57.080 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we will take our voices drop down and set
the innerHTML to be voiceOptions.

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:02.620 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Or if you'd like, you can just put this,
[removed] right away inside of here and

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:08.564 line:100% position:50% align:middle
then you've done away with this one extra
line here. So let's take a refresh of that

00:06:08.564 --> 00:06:13.290 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Refresh your page and you'll see
that as soon as the voices load,

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:18.120 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you'll get a huge drop down of all the
possible voices. Now again,

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:22.190 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you might not see all these voices but it
looks like Google does include some of

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:26.770 line:100% position:50% align:middle
their own voices as well for Chrome. Now
that those voices are actually loaded on

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:30.760 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the page, we can take a look at our
message here and open it up.

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:35.290 line:100% position:50% align:middle
There still is no voice on it but because
those voices have been loaded into the

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:39.690 line:100% position:50% align:middle
page, it will just default to our buddy
Alex which is the default one.

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:46.790 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we can now call speechSynthesis.speak,
pass it our utterance which is such a

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:49.730 line:100% position:50% align:middle
hilarious thing. It's a M-S-G.
And then when you call it...

00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:52.750 line:100% position:50% align:middle
- Hello, I love JavaScript, thumbs up.

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:58.680 line:100% position:50% align:middle
- Ah, and then we say message.text is
equal to Wes is cool. And then we could

00:06:58.680 --> 00:06:59.560 line:100% position:50% align:middle
run it again.

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:00.640 line:100% position:50% align:middle
- Wes is cool.

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:03.690 line:100% position:50% align:middle
- So you get the point what's going on
here? We've got an utterance.

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:07.840 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We've got a speech synthesis that will
then take that utterance and then talk out

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:12.570 line:100% position:50% align:middle
whatever we have. But we want to be able
to choose one of this from the drop down

00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:16.490 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and that doesn't work just yet. So we're
going to make another function called

00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:22.660 line:100% position:50% align:middle
setVoice and that is going to be called
console.log changing voice.

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:27.060 line:100% position:50% align:middle
That's going to be called when we change
from this drop down. So what is that?

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:32.320 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We have our voices drop down. We're going
to add an event listener for change,

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:38.558 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and when that happens we're going to call
setVoice. Let's try that.

00:07:41.663 --> 00:07:46.260 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Okay. So changing voice, changing voice.
Every time we change this drop down,

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:49.310 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it's actually changing it. But we don't
just want to console.log it,

00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:53.990 line:100% position:50% align:middle
what we want to do is we have our
utterance which is msg and we want to set

00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:58.730 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the voice to be...and we can't just say
like Alex or something like that because

00:07:58.730 --> 00:08:04.140 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it's not a valid voice property. So what
we need to do is find the voice that lines

00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:10.020 line:100% position:50% align:middle
up with the value. And the way we can do
that is if you were to just console.log

00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:23.250 line:100% position:50% align:middle
this.value, Anna and Ellen and Luciana. So
we need to find not just the name of it,

00:08:23.250 --> 00:08:28.510 line:100% position:50% align:middle
but if you look at our voices array, we
need to find the corresponding speech

00:08:28.510 --> 00:08:35.330 line:100% position:50% align:middle
synthesis voice object. So the way we did
that is we'll say msg.voice is equal to

00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:42.150 line:100% position:50% align:middle
voices.find. So we're going to find the
one where the voice.name is equal to

00:08:42.150 --> 00:08:43.710 line:100% position:50% align:middle
this .value.

00:08:43.710 --> 00:08:46.870 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Essentially what that's doing is it's
going to loop over every single one of

00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:53.860 line:100% position:50% align:middle
these voices in the array and it's going
to find the one where its name attribute

00:08:53.860 --> 00:09:00.490 line:100% position:50% align:middle
is the same as the option that was
currently selected like Alva,

00:09:00.490 --> 00:09:05.270 line:100% position:50% align:middle
right? So it's going to loop over until it
finds a voice.name that's equal to Alva

00:09:05.270 --> 00:09:10.630 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and then we've gone ahead and set it.
So let's try that now. Refresh.

00:09:10.630 --> 00:09:17.982 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Go ahead and select Amelle and then we can
manually call speechSynthesis.speak, MSG

00:09:17.982 --> 00:09:20.930 line:100% position:50% align:middle
- [Amelle] Hello. I love JavaScript
[Speaking in Foreign Language 00:09:20]

00:09:20.930 --> 00:09:25.680 line:100% position:50% align:middle
- Ooh, la, la. All right. Let's check out
Ellen from the Netherlands.

00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:28.730 line:100% position:50% align:middle
- [Ellen] Hello. I love JavaScript
[Speaking in Foreign Language 00:09:26]

00:09:28.730 --> 00:09:29.570 line:100% position:50% align:middle
- And Fiona.

00:09:29.570 --> 00:09:32.270 line:100% position:50% align:middle
- [Fiona] Hello. I love JavaScript,
thumps up.

00:09:32.270 --> 00:09:35.710 line:100% position:50% align:middle
- I have found that some of these Google
ones take a bit to load.

00:09:35.710 --> 00:09:39.410 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So if you do select it and it's not
working, maybe you just wait a second.

00:09:39.410 --> 00:09:42.210 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I haven't figure that totally out. See.

00:09:42.210 --> 00:09:44.580 line:100% position:50% align:middle
- [Female] Hello. I love JavaScript
[Speaking in Foreign Language 00:09:42]

00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:47.780 line:100% position:50% align:middle
- There we go, seems to be
working nice. Carmit.

00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:51.580 line:100% position:50% align:middle
- [Carmit] Hello. I love JavaScript
[Speaking in Foreign Language 00:09:50].

00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:55.710 line:100% position:50% align:middle
- It does speak the emojis in the native
language, but then just does English words

00:09:55.710 --> 00:10:00.220 line:100% position:50% align:middle
in the accent of that language which is
kind of funny. So we've got that.

00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:05.060 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now, what I want to do is make a function
that's going to...every time I change one

00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:08.630 line:100% position:50% align:middle
of these things, I want to restart it. So
that's going to be a function called

00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:15.380 line:100% position:50% align:middle
toggle. And what we're going to do is
first we're just going to cancel anything

00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:18.940 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that we have that is currently
speaking. So we're going to call

00:10:18.940 --> 00:10:25.560 line:100% position:50% align:middle
speechSynthesis.cancel, and watch this.
So if I run something,

00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:27.009 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it immediately call toggle.

00:10:27.410 --> 00:10:32.170 line:100% position:50% align:middle
It will cancel it right there. That's
what cancel do, stop it from speaking and

00:10:32.170 --> 00:10:37.170 line:100% position:50% align:middle
then we'll just restart the entire thing
which is speechSynthesis.speak.

00:10:37.170 --> 00:10:42.220 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Then we'll go back up to the set voice and
just call toggle on the end.

00:10:42.220 --> 00:10:44.920 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So now we'll go to Carmit.

00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:47.333 line:100% position:50% align:middle
- Hello. I love JavaScript...

00:10:47.333 --> 00:10:49.290 line:100% position:50% align:middle
- So every time you change...

00:10:49.290 --> 00:10:52.490 line:100% position:50% align:middle
- [Female] Hello, I love JavaScript.

00:10:52.490 --> 00:10:54.590 line:100% position:50% align:middle
- Hello.

00:10:54.590 --> 00:10:58.630 line:100% position:50% align:middle
- You get the point, right? It's going to
stop it and start it again.

00:10:58.630 --> 00:11:02.643 line:100% position:50% align:middle
You can also pass a flag here. I'm going
to call startOver, because sometimes you

00:11:02.643 --> 00:11:10.250 line:100% position:50% align:middle
might want to call pass false so it will
not restart itself and that's what you can

00:11:10.250 --> 00:11:15.920 line:100% position:50% align:middle
pass as false. So we're going to say if
startOver, and it's by default going to be

00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:19.910 line:100% position:50% align:middle
true so you don't have to pass anything
unless you explicitly want it to not

00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:25.180 line:100% position:50% align:middle
start over. And then we run it like that.
Double check this, it's still working.

00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:28.590 line:100% position:50% align:middle
- Hello. I love JavaScript.

00:11:28.590 --> 00:11:30.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
- [Female] I love JavaScript [Speaking in
Foreign Language 00:11:30]

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:37.210 line:100% position:50% align:middle
- I could toggle false and it
will stop it whereas toggle itself would

00:11:37.210 --> 00:11:41.640 line:100% position:50% align:middle
just restart it and toggle false will stop
it all. That's what this statement does

00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:46.890 line:100% position:50% align:middle
here. Good. Next up, what we want
to do is work with our rate,

00:11:46.890 --> 00:11:51.540 line:100% position:50% align:middle
our pitch, as well as our message. So
we're going to go down here and we're

00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:55.290 line:100% position:50% align:middle
going to take all of our options
which...let me take a look at.

00:11:55.290 --> 00:12:01.120 line:100% position:50% align:middle
What are our options? Options are
three inputs, the slider,

00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:05.720 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the second slider and the text area. So
we'll take all of our options here.

00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:11.990 line:100% position:50% align:middle
The options.forEach option,
option.addEventListener and we're going to

00:12:11.990 --> 00:12:17.250 line:100% position:50% align:middle
listen for the change event. And when that
happens, we are going to run a function

00:12:17.250 --> 00:12:22.990 line:100% position:50% align:middle
called set option which we'll then code
here , function setOption.

00:12:22.990 --> 00:12:27.080 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And inside of that function, we
could...let's just do this console.log,

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:33.950 line:100% position:50% align:middle
this.name and this.value. So when I slide
this rate here, it's going to tell me...

00:12:33.950 --> 00:12:39.220 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I got to go to all...the rate has changed
to 0.3. The pitch has changed to 0.4.

00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:46.234 line:100% position:50% align:middle
The pitch is at 1.9. Wes is cool.
And then I click away the text area.

00:12:46.234 --> 00:12:50.391 line:100% position:50% align:middle
The text property, I changed to I love
JavaScript, Wes is cool.

00:12:50.391 --> 00:12:56.688 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So now we've bound all of these options.
When they change, we know what property

00:12:56.688 --> 00:13:02.410 line:100% position:50% align:middle
will change which is this.name, and what
it was changed to which is this.value.

00:13:02.410 --> 00:13:06.650 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we simply need to take our message and
set what property changed,

00:13:06.650 --> 00:13:13.540 line:100% position:50% align:middle
this.name, to what changed, this.value.
And then we can run the thing...we can

00:13:13.540 --> 00:13:18.543 line:100% position:50% align:middle
stop it and start it over again.
So let's try that now.

00:13:18.543 --> 00:13:21.137 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So I'm going to change the rate up.

00:13:25.630 --> 00:13:30.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
- Hello. I love JavaScript, thumbs up.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:34.170 line:100% position:50% align:middle
- Then it'll say Wes is cool, and go to
tab away or click away.

00:13:34.170 --> 00:13:35.030 line:100% position:50% align:middle
- Wes is cool.

00:13:35.030 --> 00:13:38.760 line:100% position:50% align:middle
- And then it will rerun that. Why?
Because these things have changed.

00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:40.250 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We're also doing that on here.

00:13:40.250 --> 00:13:40.540 line:100% position:50% align:middle
- [Ellen] Wes is cool.

00:13:40.540 --> 00:13:45.750 line:100% position:50% align:middle
- Awesome. Then these buttons right here,
we got to listen for a click on them.

00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:51.790 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we'll take our speak button which is
the speak one right here,

00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:58.940 line:100% position:50% align:middle
speakButton.addEventListener, click. When
that happens, we are going to run the

00:13:58.940 --> 00:14:01.530 line:100% position:50% align:middle
function toggle and that's just
going to manually run it.

00:14:05.399 --> 00:14:08.060 line:100% position:50% align:middle
- Hello. I love JavaScript, thumbs up.

00:14:08.060 --> 00:14:09.516 line:100% position:50% align:middle
- And you can put some poops in there.

00:14:09.516 --> 00:14:11.254 line:100% position:50% align:middle
It's pretty funny when you
put emojis in there.

00:14:12.741 --> 00:14:15.580 line:100% position:50% align:middle
- Smiling pile of poo, eyes.

00:14:16.471 --> 00:14:19.350 line:100% position:50% align:middle
- [Female] [Speaking in Foreign Language
00:14:17]

00:14:19.350 --> 00:14:24.190 line:100% position:50% align:middle
- I like it. Oh, remind me...you're not
going to remind me. We should filter this

00:14:24.190 --> 00:14:28.710 line:100% position:50% align:middle
list for just English ones if that's what
you're looking for. But we do have to run

00:14:28.710 --> 00:14:36.120 line:100% position:50% align:middle
our speak button and then we also need to
listen for a click on our stop button.

00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:41.910 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So when the stop button is clicked, toggle
false. Oh, how do you do that,

00:14:41.910 --> 00:14:45.510 line:100% position:50% align:middle
folks? How do you pass an argument to a
function? Well, you might think like,

00:14:45.510 --> 00:14:50.575 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"Okay, I could... I can make it a function
like this and there's a toggle false."

00:14:50.575 --> 00:14:52.860 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Let's see if that works, so.

00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:53.910 line:100% position:50% align:middle
- Hello.

00:14:53.910 --> 00:14:57.467 line:100% position:50% align:middle
- Okay. That works but that seems a little
bit big. Is there another way

00:14:57.467 --> 00:15:00.976 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we could do it? You can't call toggle
false like that because

00:15:00.976 --> 00:15:03.021 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that's just going to run on page load.

00:15:04.063 --> 00:15:07.240 line:100% position:50% align:middle
- Hello. I love JavaScript, thumbs up.

00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:10.674 line:100% position:50% align:middle
- It doesn't do anything because
this function is not returning a function.

00:15:10.674 --> 00:15:14.500 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So, okay. Huh. So what we could
do, there's a couple different ways we

00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:18.330 line:100% position:50% align:middle
could do it. You can call .bind, pass it
the value of this which is going to be

00:15:18.330 --> 00:15:21.760 line:100% position:50% align:middle
nothing and then pass it your first
argument which is going to be false.

00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:25.830 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And that's what bind does is you take a
function and then you call it in the

00:15:25.830 --> 00:15:30.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
context of this and pass it an
argument, a false.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:31.880 line:100% position:50% align:middle
- Hello. I love...

00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:37.080 line:100% position:50% align:middle
- Works great. Or this is somewhat
popular in react right now.

00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:41.620 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And you could just do an inline function,
arrow function right here.

00:15:41.620 --> 00:15:49.050 line:100% position:50% align:middle
You say toggle false. So downside to that
is this is creating another function,

00:15:49.050 --> 00:15:53.300 line:100% position:50% align:middle
same with bind and same with the function
but that is another way to do it.

00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:55.310 line:100% position:50% align:middle
- Hello. I love...

00:15:55.310 --> 00:15:58.950 line:100% position:50% align:middle
- And it's really not that big of a deal
in this case, unless I was creating lots

00:15:58.950 --> 00:16:03.390 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and lots and lots of these. So we've got
that. Last thing I wanted to do is filter

00:16:03.390 --> 00:16:08.960 line:100% position:50% align:middle
this list for only ones that are English
like our friend Karen from Australia.

00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:14.450 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So what we'll go do before we map, we'll
simply add a quick filter in there for the

00:16:14.450 --> 00:16:20.930 line:100% position:50% align:middle
voice and we say, "If the
voice.lang.includes EN." And that should

00:16:20.930 --> 00:16:26.730 line:100% position:50% align:middle
just trim that list down to ones that
include EN before we map over it.

00:16:26.730 --> 00:16:31.442 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And then when I refresh, you only see a
smaller subset of the list of the ones

00:16:31.442 --> 00:16:35.840 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that we have there. So that is the
Voiceinator 5000. It's actually pretty

00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:39.210 line:100% position:50% align:middle
simple to get all of this code up and
running. We just created a couple

00:16:39.210 --> 00:16:43.220 line:100% position:50% align:middle
different functions that will listen for
when the different elements are changed

00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:47.620 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and then it says it for us. Hopefully you
enjoyed that. I love to see what you make

00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:50.148 line:100% position:50% align:middle
of it and I will see you tomorrow.
