00:00:06.978 --> 00:00:10,130 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Today we are going to be taking two of the
things that we've done in the past,

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:14,630 line:100% position:50% align:middle
which is working with mouse move events
and second working with HTML5 video.

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:17,320 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And we're going to sort of put them
together. We are going to mash them into

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21,950 line:100% position:50% align:middle
our colab. So this is just an idea that
I've had. I don't know if it's totally a

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:25,030 line:100% position:50% align:middle
great idea but I know that it was a fun
thing to build regardless.

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:27,990 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So I run a video site where I've got a lot
of people watching my videos,

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31,720 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and I'm always thinking about how do I
make the viewing experience a little bit

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35,180 line:100% position:50% align:middle
better? So one thing that a lot of
developers like to do is they don't watch

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:40,310 line:100% position:50% align:middle
their videos at 1x. They watch them at
like 1.5 or 2 or like they like to speed

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:43,160 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it up and slow it down depending on how
quickly or how boring,

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46,200 line:100% position:50% align:middle
or how exciting something is, or how
important something is.

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51,860 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So what I really wanted to do here is just
experiment with a new sort of input that

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:55,910 line:100% position:50% align:middle
would control how fast the video goes so
that rather than you having to click up

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:59,970 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and down to change the video speed, you
can sort of just like DJ it here as you're

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:04,810 line:100% position:50% align:middle
watching the video to go slower and
faster. So I'm just going to give you a

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:11,615 line:100% position:50% align:middle
little play here. And then chipmunk, and
then you slow it down.

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:26,157 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So you see what's going on here. As I move
this, like the lowest is going to be 0.5x

00:01:26.157 --> 00:01:31,657 line:100% position:50% align:middle
or 0.4x and then the highest is going to
be all the way up to 4x.

00:01:31.657 --> 00:01:35,020 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And then as you mouse over or as you click
and drag, depending on how you like to do

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:40,110 line:100% position:50% align:middle
your interface, we are just changing that
value and then it's indirectly going to be

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44,270 line:100% position:50% align:middle
setting the playback rate on this video.
So let's jump into it.

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:49,200 line:100% position:50% align:middle
This won't be too big of a one. So far
what I've done is I've selected the speed,

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:55,280 line:100% position:50% align:middle
which is the entire white bar here, and
then we have the speed bar which is going

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:00,270 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to be the field in here or with that sort
of blue gradient right here.

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05,010 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And then I've just got a video sort of
playing here streaming off of Dropbox.

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:07,860 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Hopefully it doesn't get shut down.
So it's a lot of bandwidth.

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12,670 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And then I've got a video element here,
which is the actual video here.

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:18,230 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now, I'm going to take auto play off just
for our sanity's sake so it doesn't keep

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:22,710 line:100% position:50% align:middle
playing every single time. And then what
happens is when you hover over top of this

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:27,000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we are going to change the playback rate
as well as update the actual visual.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31,130 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So let's do the visual part first and then
we'll work on the playback rate.

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:36,590 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So first thing we need to do is take our
speed and add the event listener of mouse

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:42,340 line:100% position:50% align:middle
move. And when that happens we'll have a
function. I'm using a proper function here

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:46,840 line:100% position:50% align:middle
because I need this to be equal to the
video itself. Sorry, not the video,

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:52,060 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the actual speed bar when you mouse over
it. And cool. In that function pass

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:57,280 line:100% position:50% align:middle
yourself the event and then let's just
console log the event when you mouse over

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:02,100 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it. Open that sucker up in your browser
and you should see this video that we've

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:06,990 line:100% position:50% align:middle
got going on and our thing. Now when I
start hovering over top of it,

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:11,560 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you will now see all the different events
that we have going on it.

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15,050 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So first of all we need to get where like
this is going to be zero pixels and this

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:20,120 line:100% position:50% align:middle
is going to be however high it is. Let's
talk look look look- 410,

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22,620 line:100% position:50% align:middle
so that's going to be 410
pixels. So how do we get that?

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:26,510 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We'll say cons y is equal to and we'll do
the same thing we did in the last video,

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:31,790 line:100% position:50% align:middle
e dot page y and we are going to take the
offset of this, dot offset top.

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:35,980 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Why? Because we can't assume that this bar
is going to be at the top of it.

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40,480 line:100% position:50% align:middle
There might be padding, or merging or
anything or another element in-between it.

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44,620 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So let's console log y, see what we've got
there. There we go.

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:47,990 line:100% position:50% align:middle
You see at the top, you're getting zero.
All the way at the bottom we are getting

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:53,520 line:100% position:50% align:middle
around 410. So that's showing us how far
along we are. We want to turn that into a

00:03:53.520 --> 00:04:00,170 line:100% position:50% align:middle
percentage. So if this is a 410 pixel, if
I go to 205 pixels, right around here,

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:09,000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that should be 50%. Let's say const
percent is equal to let's take y divided

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14,260 line:100% position:50% align:middle
by this dot offset height. That's a way to
get the height of the actual one that we

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:21,720 line:100% position:50% align:middle
have there. So let's console log the
percent. There we go. So that is a one.

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:26,987 line:100% position:50% align:middle
That is zero. And we could bump those up
to get to what we want.

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:33,250 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Then we also need a min and a max because
want this to be 0.4 and this to be 4,

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:39,323 line:100% position:50% align:middle
right? So how do we do that? I would say
const min equals 0.4 and const.

00:04:39.323 --> 00:04:43,400 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Max is equal to, I don't know, max is
equal to 4x or whatever you think the

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:49,120 line:100% position:50% align:middle
crazy upper bound. Then what we do is
we'll make a height variable and we're

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:54,300 line:100% position:50% align:middle
going to set that to...the percentage
right now is like 0.99 and we want to turn

00:04:54.300 --> 00:05:00,910 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that into 99%. Take our percent variable,
multiply it by a hundred and then we'll

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:12,370 line:100% position:50% align:middle
wrap that sucker in, I thought, round. And
then add percent to the end and console

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:17,680 line:100% position:50% align:middle
log the height. See what we've got here.
All right. So now we actually are getting

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:22,860 line:100% position:50% align:middle
a full percentage that we're looking for
rather than a zero point something

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:28,070 line:100% position:50% align:middle
whatever, and then we'll take our bar
which is the speed bar, a bar,

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:39,000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that style. The height is equal to height.
Look at this. So so far,

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43,570 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we've got it up and going. Looks good.
Next thing we need to do is update that

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:50,380 line:100% position:50% align:middle
number that's inside of there, and the way
that we do that is we will then calculate

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:57,160 line:100% position:50% align:middle
what the playback rate is. Let's say const
playback rate is going to be equal to.

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:01,630 line:100% position:50% align:middle
This is going to be a bit of a weird one
because we don't want the minimum to be

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:08,129 line:100% position:50% align:middle
zero and the maximum to be one. That's not
the playback rate. At a 0% height,

00:06:08.129 --> 00:06:14,940 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it should be 0.4x and at a 100% height it
should be 4x. So we sort of need to do a

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:19,010 line:100% position:50% align:middle
little bit of math to get that lower and
upper bounds. And the way that you do that

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:24,780 line:100% position:50% align:middle
is you take your percent and you multiply
that by the max minus the min plus the

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:28,350 line:100% position:50% align:middle
min. And that's sort of how you can offset
your height. We did that in a couple of

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:31,600 line:100% position:50% align:middle
videos ago when we were doing the
tech shot at one when you

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:37,320 line:100% position:50% align:middle
needed to hover negative 50 and plus 50,
not 0 to 100. And that's just a neat way

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:41,540 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that we can do that.
We have that playback rate and we can take

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:48,590 line:100% position:50% align:middle
our bar and set the text content to be
that playback rate. See here.

00:06:50.035 --> 00:06:56,400 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So you see it's just like a crazy number.
So we can take that and just run dot two

00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:02,710 line:100% position:50% align:middle
fixed on it and just give us two decimal
places. There we go and then you can tack

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:08,720 line:100% position:50% align:middle
on your little x or something onto the
end. So plus x or you could use a template

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:16,350 line:100% position:50% align:middle
string to pop up that in. Looking pretty
snazzy. Last thing we need to do is

00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:20,070 line:100% position:50% align:middle
actually to take that playback rate that
we have here, console log,

00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:23,810 line:100% position:50% align:middle
playback rate. Let's see what we got going
on here. Three point five.

00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:29,120 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We've got to take that value and apply it
to our video. So let's say video dot

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:34,730 line:100% position:50% align:middle
playback rate. And what playback rate is,
take a look at it in our console here,

00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:41,170 line:100% position:50% align:middle
video dot playback rate. One is just
normal speed. So two is equal to,

00:07:41.170 --> 00:07:51,240 line:100% position:50% align:middle
if we were to play it ourselves...ten. The
audio stops at some point.

00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:58,470 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Four, zero point two. The audio stops at a
very slow amount as well.

00:07:58.470 --> 00:08:06,770 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Like 0.5 is as low as you can get it.
Sounds like I'm just wasted trying to

00:08:06.770 --> 00:08:12,820 line:100% position:50% align:middle
teach you Flexbox. So video dot playback
rate equals playback rate.

00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:16,590 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And don't worry about those long
percentage. I know some people are irked

00:08:16.590 --> 00:08:21,360 line:100% position:50% align:middle
when you have like very long decimal
places but it won't be issue there.

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:35,113 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now we'll give it a play. Looks good. Nice
and fast. Slow. Fantastic.

00:08:35.113 --> 00:08:40,472 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So that was kind of cool. We did there is
we both calculated the height as well as

00:08:40.472 --> 00:08:45,173 line:100% position:50% align:middle
attached the playback rate. If you don't
like doing both your presentation and your

00:08:45.173 --> 00:08:48,990 line:100% position:50% align:middle
functionality in a single function, you
could shell that off to two separate

00:08:48.990 --> 00:08:52,860 line:100% position:50% align:middle
functions which you would just then call
from your mass move event right here and

00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:58,540 line:100% position:50% align:middle
then also we could take this function out
and call it handle move and then up here

00:08:58.540 --> 00:09:03,784 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we'll make a function or replace that
function. We'll call it a handle move.

00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:07,340 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Then you're just going to hook that up to
mouse move but maybe you'll also want to

00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:12,770 line:100% position:50% align:middle
hook it up to touch move or any other
event that you wanted. Got that.

00:09:12.770 --> 00:09:17,477 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Still works wonderfully. Excellent.

00:09:17.477 --> 00:09:19,819 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So hopefully you enjoyed that
and I will see you tomorrow.
