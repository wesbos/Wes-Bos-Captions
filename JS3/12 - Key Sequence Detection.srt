00:00:07.485 --> 00:00:10,114 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Today we're going to learn
about key sequencing detection,

00:00:10.114 --> 00:00:14,480 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and that means when someone
inputs a certain sequence of keys

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18,580 line:100% position:50% align:middle
into your window or into an inputter,
something like that, then something needs

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:23,270 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to happen. And what this is used
most for online is the Konami code

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:26,650 line:100% position:50% align:middle
which is, if you grew up in the 1980s or
1990s, you'll know that you can type in

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:30,890 line:100% position:50% align:middle
up, up, down, down, left, right, left,
right, B, A, start, and what that will do

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:34,540 line:100% position:50% align:middle
is it will trigger like unlimited lives
in Mario or something like that.

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:38,070 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So, I figured out Buzzfeed, of all
websites, has a Konami code.

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41,140 line:100% position:50% align:middle
If you go to the website and press
up, up, down, down, left, right,

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45,800 line:100% position:50% align:middle
left, right, B, A, enter, and it changes
all the words to Wilkie,

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:51,300 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I'm not sure who that is, but it's pretty
funny. Different websites have little

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54,984 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Easter eggs that you can
surface. So, let's see how

00:00:54.984 --> 00:00:57,740 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that works. We'll go into our
scriptag, and we will listen for the

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:01,810 line:100% position:50% align:middle
window.addEventListener. You're going to
listen for the keyup event,

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:07,030 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and when that happens we are going to run
a function here, which we are going to go

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:11,590 line:100% position:50% align:middle
into console.log(e.key), and that's going
to tell us the name of the key that they

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:15,750 line:100% position:50% align:middle
have pressed. So if I press up,
it's arrow up, a down, arrow down,

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19,580 line:100% position:50% align:middle
A, S, D, F, you get the point right here.

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23,780 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So, now what we need to do is whenever
someone presses one of these items,

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:29,510 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we're going to push it into an array. So,
we're going to first make a pressed array,

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:33,990 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and then we also need to look,
what is it that we're looking for.

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39,100 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So, in this case, secret code... In our
case I'm just going to look for the word

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:45,740 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"wesbos." Now we go into here,
and we'll say pressed.push(e.key),

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:47,380 line:100% position:50% align:middle
[inaudible 01:47] console.log(pressed).

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:56,790 line:100% position:50% align:middle
All right, see what's happening whenever I
type something? We get the specific key,

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:02,110 line:100% position:50% align:middle
whatever is pressed, into that array. Now,
that's great, and it makes sense,

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:05,740 line:100% position:50% align:middle
but that could get fairly big, and
that is essentially a key logger,

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:10,030 line:100% position:50% align:middle
where you're logging everything the person
has logged. So what we want to do is just

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14,490 line:100% position:50% align:middle
trim this array to be the maximum that
we would ever need. And in our case,

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:19,254 line:100% position:50% align:middle
if we're just looking for the word
"wesbos," then we are maximum looking

00:02:19.254 --> 00:02:24,720 line:100% position:50% align:middle
for six characters. So, just going to
splice that real quickly, we're going to

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:31,130 line:100% position:50% align:middle
say, "pressed.splice." Now we want
to start from counting from the back,

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:35,610 line:100% position:50% align:middle
because if I... Let me refresh this. If I
say "wesbos..." I guess I got to type it

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:42,440 line:100% position:50% align:middle
up here. "Wesbos is cool." If I want
to...say I'm looking for "is cool." What

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:49,140 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we want to do is we want to start
from the end and go forward.

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52,530 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We don't want to start from the start and
go in, so, the way that we do that is we

00:02:52.530 --> 00:03:02,530 line:100% position:50% align:middle
use a -secretCode.length - 1,
and if I'm looking for six letters,

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:08,300 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that's going to go from the back, up seven
letters, and then we're going to trim from

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:12,480 line:100% position:50% align:middle
there, which is going to be the
pressed.length, which is the length of the

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:18,998 line:100% position:50% align:middle
array minus the secretCode.length, and
that will give us the exact number that we

00:03:18.998 --> 00:03:26,267 line:100% position:50% align:middle
need. So, now if I refresh, and we say,
"Wes is cool," you see as I start to get

00:03:26.267 --> 00:03:32,221 line:100% position:50% align:middle
over that budget of six letters, it starts
to push out the first ones that were

00:03:32.221 --> 00:03:36,894 line:100% position:50% align:middle
pushed. So I could keep typing, "Wesbos."
At that point it says "Wesbos," but if I

00:03:36.894 --> 00:03:41,550 line:100% position:50% align:middle
type, "i," the "w" gets
pushed out into the array.

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:46,750 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now all that's left is we need to check if
this array contains the secret code that

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:52,160 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we are looking for. So we say if
pressed.join, because that we want to

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55,750 line:100% position:50% align:middle
turn it into a string really quickly,
and I'll show you what that does.

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:00,110 line:100% position:50% align:middle
That will make it into a string, so,
if pressed.join, which is the string,

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:07,090 line:100% position:50% align:middle
.includes(secretCode), then we can do
things like console.log('DING DING!').

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:09,820 line:100% position:50% align:middle
You did it.

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:17,210 line:100% position:50% align:middle
W-E-S-B-O-S, and there we go, ding, ding,
it includes what we're looking for,

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:22,000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and at that point we can do some fun
stuff. So, way back there was this thing

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27,240 line:100% position:50% align:middle
called cornify.js, and I'll show you what
it does. There is a function called

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:35,770 line:100% position:50% align:middle
cornify_add, and when you run it,
"wesbos," it adds unicorns or rainbows or

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:42,540 line:100% position:50% align:middle
random stuff to the screen. So if I do
it again, it's going to add another one,

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:45,802 line:100% position:50% align:middle
another one, another one, another
one...you get the point, right?

00:04:45.802 --> 00:04:49,479 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We're just adding hilarious different
unicorns at random. And all you have to

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:55,011 line:100% position:50% align:middle
do is call this cornify_add, so that's
it. That's the basics of getting up a

00:04:55.011 --> 00:04:59,497 line:100% position:50% align:middle
key sequencing detection, store them in an
array, and then check every single time

00:04:59.497 --> 00:05:02,240 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that they key up if it matches
what you're looking for.

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:04,658 line:100% position:50% align:middle
