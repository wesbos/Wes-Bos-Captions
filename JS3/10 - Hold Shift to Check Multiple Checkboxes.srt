Today's exercise is, I think, a bit of a
tough one and I really want you to give it

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:17,140 line:100% position:50% align:middle
a shot on your own. Let me explain what it
does and then I'll give you a shot to go

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:21,240 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and do it on your own. The end code
is not actually all that complicated.

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25,490 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I found that it was a little bit tough for
me to come around to this idea at first

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:29,190 line:100% position:50% align:middle
though. So, here's how it works. You click
a checkbox, you hold down your shift key,

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:32,900 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you click another one, and all the
checkboxes in between the first one and

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:37,440 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the second one that you clicked will then
be checked. This works top to bottom,

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41,400 line:100% position:50% align:middle
but also bottom to top. So, if I
click on this one, hold down shift,

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:47,880 line:100% position:50% align:middle
click on here, it's going to go bottom to
top. So, it goes all ways depending on

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:51,240 line:100% position:50% align:middle
what you're working on. You can go either
way. And this is a fairly common thing

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:55,980 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that you're going to see in applications
such as Gmail, where you want to select a

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00,452 line:100% position:50% align:middle
whole bunch of emails and delete them
at once. Let's take a quick look at our

00:01:00.452 --> 00:01:05,280 line:100% position:50% align:middle
HTML here. We've got our input with the
type of checkbox and a paragraph type.

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10,120 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Probably a label would be more suited
for something like that, but whatever.

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:13,490 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We are working with it. Then we've
got a script tag here. And by the way,

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16,960 line:100% position:50% align:middle
if you're wondering why I always
indent my script tags so far to the left,

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20,090 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it's just because I need the
horizontal space. If it bugs you,

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:25,550 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I'm sorry, but I need to make sure
my code fits on the screen. Now,

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:29,916 line:100% position:50% align:middle
give it a shot yourself and I'll see you
back here, hopefully triumphant,

00:01:29.916 --> 00:01:34,526 line:100% position:50% align:middle
maybe not, and we'll go through it
together. So, here we go. Well, first

00:01:34.526 --> 00:01:38,590 line:100% position:50% align:middle
thing we need to do is select every single
one of the checkboxes because we need to

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:44,070 line:100% position:50% align:middle
listen for when they get checked.
So, we'll say, "const checkboxes =

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:53,630 line:100% position:50% align:middle
document.querySelectorAll." And we want
to grab ".inbox" and we want to grab the

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:58,156 line:100% position:50% align:middle
inputs. I have a type of checkbox that
I'll probably input on there as well.

00:01:58.156 --> 00:02:04,420 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Good. Let's just double check that we got
all those checkboxes, "querySelectorAll."

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:09,644 line:100% position:50% align:middle
You have to spell it right,
"querySelectorAll." There we go.

00:02:09.644 --> 00:02:10,991 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Input, input, input. Okay. Good.

00:02:10.991 --> 00:02:13,600 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I've got all of the inputs
that I'm working with here.

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17,860 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now we need to listen for when
one of them gets clicked or changed.

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:23,340 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So, we will take the checkboxes,
and we will loop over each one.

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:29,390 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Checkbox. And on that we are going to tick
the checkbox and "addEventListener."

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33,660 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We are going to listen for a click. I
initially thought that you had to listen

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:38,440 line:100% position:50% align:middle
for the change event, but apparently the
click event will fire even if you use your

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:43,480 line:100% position:50% align:middle
keyboard,.which is really handy to know.
We've got our "addEventListener,"

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:48,090 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and when someone clicks it, we are going
to run a function called "handleCheck."

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:54,951 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now let's go up here and make that
function. We'll have this event and we'll

00:02:54.951 --> 00:03:02,945 line:100% position:50% align:middle
just console log the event. Click.
All right. Click. Click. Click.

00:03:02.945 --> 00:03:05,603 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We're getting the
information for every single one.

00:03:05.603 --> 00:03:11,990 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now, this is where the hard
part starts to happen, where we need

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:16,830 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to log, when I check my first one, we need
to put that into a variable. Because when

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:22,400 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you check your second one and you're
holding down shift, we need to know what

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26,365 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that last one was. So, we're going to
make a variable up here called "let

00:03:26.365 --> 00:03:31,505 line:100% position:50% align:middle
lastChecked." And the reason why I'm
using let is because that's going to be

00:03:31.505 --> 00:03:38,591 line:100% position:50% align:middle
reassigned constantly. And then inside of
here, sort of the last thing that we're

00:03:38.591 --> 00:03:44,820 line:100% position:50% align:middle
going to do is we'll say "lastChecked =
this." That's like the last thing we're

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:49,235 line:100% position:50% align:middle
going to do but we'll put it on there.
Now, when I click one and we type in

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:55,070 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"lastChecked," we have a reference
to the input that was last checked.

00:03:55.070 --> 00:04:03,290 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now up here, a couple of things we need to
do. We need to check if they had the shift

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:10,410 line:100% position:50% align:middle
key down. So, I'm going to say, "if
e.shiftKey." If the event ".shiftKey" is

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:14,560 line:100% position:50% align:middle
there, that means they were holding
it down. Then we'll go ahead and write our

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17,890 line:100% position:50% align:middle
code. However, the other thing
we need to do is when I uncheck,

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:23,460 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it will also trigger "handleCheck." So, we
need to make sure that check if they had a

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:31,950 line:100% position:50% align:middle
shift key down and check that they
are checking it. So, not unchecking it.

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:34,580 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Right? Because you don't care if they're
unchecking it. You want to check if they

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:38,690 line:100% position:50% align:middle
are uncheck... Okay, let's stop saying
the word checked. Let's gut it.

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:44,930 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And "this.checked." Like it's taboo.
Stop saying it. So if the shift key is

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:53,751 line:100% position:50% align:middle
down and they are checking the box, then
we can go ahead and do what we please.

00:04:53.751 --> 00:04:57,251 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And inside of here, now, this is where our

00:04:57.251 --> 00:05:04,020 line:100% position:50% align:middle
sausage gets made. What we are going to do
here, is we are going to loop through

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:08,370 line:100% position:50% align:middle
every single checkbox. Every time this
happens, we are going to loop over every

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:13,940 line:100% position:50% align:middle
single checkbox. And what we're going to
do is we're going to look for the first

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:19,900 line:100% position:50% align:middle
one that was checked, and then I check
down here. What's going to happen is,

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:24,063 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we're going to say, "Oh, you're not.
You're not the first one. Oh, you are the

00:05:24.063 --> 00:05:28,550 line:100% position:50% align:middle
first one. Okay, good." Then go to the
next one, check it. Next one, check it.

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:32,540 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Next one, check it. This one, "Oh,
you're the last one that's checked.

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:38,180 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Stop it." And then these two won't be
checked. So, rather than try and figure

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:44,730 line:100% position:50% align:middle
out where in the dom they are and trying
to figure out like which elements are

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:51,110 line:100% position:50% align:middle
in-between it, and finding parents and...
I find that's really fragile a way to do

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:57,240 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it because you're depending on having the
HTML set just so, and then if someone else

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:01,670 line:100% position:50% align:middle
comes along and changes the
HTML a little bit, it will just break.

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:06,450 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So, we are going to loop over every single
checkbox. We're going to create a

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:11,740 line:100% position:50% align:middle
variable called in-between. And what
in-between will do is we'll loop over this

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:15,890 line:100% position:50% align:middle
one and I'll say in-between false. We'll
loop over this one, in-between false.

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:19,290 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We'll loop over this one and it's going to
say, "Okay, this is where we started."

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:24,120 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We are now in the area which we
wish to check, so let's check it.

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:28,120 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Check it. Check it. Check it. Because the
in-between variable is going to be set to

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:32,620 line:100% position:50% align:middle
true when we are here. And then when we
hit our last one, we are going to say

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:37,270 line:100% position:50% align:middle
in-between is false, because we are done
and we're no longer going to check any

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:42,730 line:100% position:50% align:middle
others. So, this will probably take a
couple of read overs, but let's get it.

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:49,740 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So, we will go up here before we do the
f statement, we'll say, "let inBetween =,"

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:55,310 line:100% position:50% align:middle
capital B on that in-between,
"false." So, we're not in-between.

00:06:55.310 --> 00:07:04,530 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And then here we are going to
loop over every single checkbox.

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:13,920 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Say, "checkboxes.forEach" checkbox,
and let's just console log checkbox.

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:21,002 line:100% position:50% align:middle
See where we're at. So, if I click
one, nothing. And now I'm going to

00:07:21.002 --> 00:07:25,018 line:100% position:50% align:middle
hold down my shift key and
click another one. Okay, so when that

00:07:25.018 --> 00:07:30,110 line:100% position:50% align:middle
happened, I get every single checkbox
along the way. Now we need to figure out,

00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:35,710 line:100% position:50% align:middle
as we are looping for this, we've got to
set this in-between variable to true.

00:07:35.710 --> 00:07:45,336 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And the way that we are going to do that
is we say "if checkbox is equal to this or

00:07:45.336 --> 00:07:56,190 line:100% position:50% align:middle
checkbox is equal to last checked, then
in-between is..." We normally would say

00:07:56.190 --> 00:07:59,370 line:100% position:50% align:middle
in-between is equal to true, but since we
wanted to go both ways, we say in-between

00:07:59.370 --> 00:08:05,390 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to the opposite of itself. What? Okay,
let's go through this. One sec. If the

00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:13,990 line:100% position:50% align:middle
checkbox is equal to this, so here we go,
check it. Let me do it backwards this way

00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:18,200 line:100% position:50% align:middle
so we can understand. So, check this
one. I hold down shift and I click on

00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:22,850 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"check one item." And what's going
to happen is we're going to go through

00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:26,440 line:100% position:50% align:middle
this one. It's going to say, "Is that
in-between? No." It's going to go through

00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:30,920 line:100% position:50% align:middle
this one and say, "Is the checkbox
equal to this? And what is this?"

00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:34,820 line:100% position:50% align:middle
This is going to be the one that got
checked. And that's the checkbox.

00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:39,890 line:100% position:50% align:middle
This one is going to be equal to the same
one that we are currently looping over.

00:08:39.890 --> 00:08:44,500 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So, that going to be true. So, we're
going to turn on that in-between variable.

00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:50,460 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And then the other way around it is if we
go this way, last checked, and then we go

00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:54,840 line:100% position:50% align:middle
down to good luck and click it again. It's
going to still go from top to bottom but

00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:59,750 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it's going to say, "If the checkbox is the
last checked one," mean that this is the

00:08:59.750 --> 00:09:04,200 line:100% position:50% align:middle
currently checked one, but "check
one item" is the last checked one.

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:07,740 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So, I feel like I'm saying "checked"
a lot, but we got this. We got this.

00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:17,570 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So in-between, so you could console log
starting to check them in-between.

00:09:17.570 --> 00:09:24,270 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Check there, check there. And what happens
is, here we go, one, we get to this one

00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:27,058 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and it says, "Okay. Good. Now we're
starting, starting to check them

00:09:27.058 --> 00:09:31,164 line:100% position:50% align:middle
in-between. Down, down,
down, down, and then down.

00:09:31.164 --> 00:09:32,757 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And then once we hit this one,

00:09:32.757 --> 00:09:37,200 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that's the last one that we checked. So,
it console logs it again. That means we're

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:41,530 line:100% position:50% align:middle
finished, which is why we
do this opposite thing. So, if it's true,

00:09:41.530 --> 00:09:45,900 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it's false. If it's false, it's true. And
then we hit these last two, which aren't

00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:51,120 line:100% position:50% align:middle
going to be. So, we can say down
here we have another "if" statement that's

00:09:51.120 --> 00:10:05,890 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"if inBetween," capital B, "then
checkbox.checked equals true."

00:10:05.890 --> 00:10:12,080 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Check it. Hold down shift, check another
one. Bam. Nailed it. Okay, let's see

00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:16,680 line:100% position:50% align:middle
what's going on there.
We set a flag variable called in-between

00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:21,630 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that is set to false. Once we hit that
first one, it's going to be true,

00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:26,930 line:100% position:50% align:middle
which is going to check if it's on and
then we're going to programatically set it

00:10:26.930 --> 00:10:31,290 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to checked with Javascript. And we're
going to do that for every single one unti

00:10:31.290 --> 00:10:36,186 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we hit that last one, which our flag
variable called in-between, gets set to

00:10:36.186 --> 00:10:42,560 line:100% position:50% align:middle
false and it will no longer run it
for these first two or for these last two.

00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:47,900 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And that works both ways from bottom to
top because we did this little diddy right

00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:52,000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
here where we checked if it's equal to
this, which is the one we clicked,

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56,560 line:100% position:50% align:middle
or if it's the one that we last checked.
So, that's it. It's actually fairly

00:10:56.560 --> 00:11:01,050 line:100% position:50% align:middle
simple now that we have it. It's not a lot
of code. It's just a little bit hard to

00:11:01.050 --> 00:11:05,530 line:100% position:50% align:middle
understand what's going on. So, maybe
go through that a couple more times.

00:11:05.530 --> 00:11:08,850 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Go do it yourself from scratch so you
totally understand it. Other than that,

00:11:08.850 --> 00:11:11,550 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I hope you enjoyed it. Let me
know what you think of that one.

00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:12,872 line:100% position:50% align:middle
See you tomorrow.

00:11:14.345 --> 00:11:17,692 line:100% position:50% align:middle
