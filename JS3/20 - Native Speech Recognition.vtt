Today we are going to learn all about
speech recognition in the browser.

00:00:12.604 --> 00:00:16.450 line:100% position:50% align:middle
While it's not perfect, it's actually
really impressive that you can do this

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:21.830 line:100% position:50% align:middle
without any libraries or external APIs,
just do it straight in the browser.

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:30.540 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So let's open up our index - start and
Phyllis open. All right,

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:33.930 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I'm just going to get this sucker running
while I'll explain what we got going on.

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.370 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Some hilarious results here.

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:41.240 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we've got speech recognition. It's a
global variable that lives in the browser

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:45.850 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and that lives on top of the window. Now
in Chrome it lives at Webkit speech

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.900 line:100% position:50% align:middle
recognition and currently it's only
available in Firefox.

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:55.760 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So right here what we're doing is we're
just setting it to be speech recognition

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.470 line:100% position:50% align:middle
even if it is Webkit speech recognition.
Then what we need to do is go ahead and

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:02.575 line:100% position:50% align:middle
create a new instance of speech
recognition. Let's see,

00:01:02.575 --> 00:01:04.240 line:100% position:50% align:middle
this guy's still going, yes.

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:18.510 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we will say const recognition equals
new speech recognition and then we need to

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:24.710 line:100% position:50% align:middle
take that recognition variable and set
something called the interim results.

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:28.670 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And that has to be true. And what that's
going to do is as you are speaking,

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.500 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you can see right here...as I'm speaking
it's sort of populating it.

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:37.250 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And if you don't do that, you need to stop
speaking before it will give you anything.

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.603 line:100% position:50% align:middle
That's a bit frustrating. So we want to be
able to see what we're saying

00:01:40.603 --> 00:01:42.025 line:100% position:50% align:middle
as we are speaking.

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.910 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we got our interim results here. Then
what we need to do is create a paragraph.

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:53.590 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And if I inspect this right here, you'll
see what's happening is that I'm updating

00:01:53.590 --> 00:02:00.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the last paragraph in here. And then when
I stop speaking, it creates a new

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.830 line:100% position:50% align:middle
paragraph as if we were saying a new
sentence. And then when I stop speaking

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:10.140 line:100% position:50% align:middle
again, is going to create a new paragraph.
And the browser is going to tell us when

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:16.230 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it's finished processing what I'm...
the brams. This is the best one ever.

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.760 line:100% position:50% align:middle
All right. So we've got that recognition.
We need to create a paragraph.

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.132 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So let's say, let P equals... And I'll
tell you why I'm using "let" there

00:02:24.132 --> 00:02:25.076 line:100% position:50% align:middle
in just a second.

00:02:25.076 --> 00:02:30.050 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We'll say a document.create element
and that's going to be a paragraph.

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:37.290 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And then we also need to get this words
right here. They've other class of words.

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:45.180 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we say const words equals
document.query selector.words.

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:51.500 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And then we'll take that words and we'll
append the child P, which is going to be

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.626 line:100% position:50% align:middle
our first one because we're
going to put it in the DOM

00:02:53.626 --> 00:02:55.611 line:100% position:50% align:middle
just as we are working with it.

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:59.700 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Next this work is just the same as
listening for clicks. So we take our

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.900 line:100% position:50% align:middle
recognition and we add an event listener
but we don't listen for click but we

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:09.160 line:100% position:50% align:middle
listen for a result. And when the results
comes back, were going to get an event

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:13.230 line:100% position:50% align:middle
which... Let's just take a look at what
that actual event gives us here.

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:20.720 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Console log E. So give that a save. Now
you do have to run this through a server.

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:24.140 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Just like we did with the WebCam, you
can't just run it on a file.

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:27.840 line:100% position:50% align:middle
It has to be localhost or something like
that. So take your index file and run it

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:32.285 line:100% position:50% align:middle
through some sort of server. If you're not
sure, I've created a quick...

00:03:32.285 --> 00:03:35.101 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Where is it here?

00:03:39.302 --> 00:03:43.470 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I've created a quick little server for you
here in the speech detection folder.

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:46.710 line:100% position:50% align:middle
All you need to do is type MPM install and
then when that's installed,

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:50.630 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you type MPM start and what that will do
is it's just going to open up a little

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:55.780 line:100% position:50% align:middle
server for you and then we open up the
index - start. Now that will probably pop

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:00.780 line:100% position:50% align:middle
open a little dialog box that will say
can this access your microphone and you'll

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:05.900 line:100% position:50% align:middle
say yes or no. But as we start speaking,
actually we don't see anything just yet

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:08.830 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and that's because we haven't started
this. Take your recognition and call

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:13.561 line:100% position:50% align:middle
recognition.start as you don't want to
unnecessarily run it on page load

00:04:13.561 --> 00:04:17.660 line:100% position:50% align:middle
because you might want to prompt the
user that "Hey we're going to ask for your

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:20.330 line:100% position:50% align:middle
microphone, don't turn it down otherwise
we won't be able to see this."

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:25.540 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So there we go. Now it should be running.
So we see our paragraph tag being put into

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:31.750 line:100% position:50% align:middle
here. We've started it. We have an all add
or add event listener result singular not

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:36.270 line:100% position:50% align:middle
results. Now when you speak into the
microphone, you should be seeing something

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:44.780 line:100% position:50% align:middle
popping up in your console. Now when
you speak into the microphone,

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:48.361 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you should be seeing some speech
recognition events pop up

00:04:48.361 --> 00:04:50.364 line:100% position:50% align:middle
into your console.

00:04:53.268 --> 00:04:58.030 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now when you speak into your microphone,
you should see some speech recognition

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:03.320 line:100% position:50% align:middle
event results just flooding into your
console. Now if you don't see anything,

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:06.660 line:100% position:50% align:middle
make sure that it don't have like the
answer or anything else that's jacking

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:11.420 line:100% position:50% align:middle
your microphone up opened in another tab.
That's something I spent way too much time

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:15.975 line:100% position:50% align:middle
debugging and you just have to realize
sometimes the microphone would be used

00:05:15.975 --> 00:05:17.478 line:100% position:50% align:middle
on another tab.

00:05:17.478 --> 00:05:21.440 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we have this event and let's just find
a random one right here.

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:27.770 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Open up that event and go to the results.
Inside of the results...let's just console

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:36.820 line:100% position:50% align:middle
E.results. That is going to be a list of
results and I say list because it's not an

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:40.990 line:100% position:50% align:middle
array. It looks like an array, but if you
open up the prototype and see what's in

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:44.330 line:100% position:50% align:middle
there, you'll see that there is no Map or
for each or anything like that.

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:48.670 line:100% position:50% align:middle
That's going to be a bit of an issue for
us so we can convert that to an array or

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:52.890 line:100% position:50% align:middle
use ES 64 ave to iterate over it.

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:58.110 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So here we've got a list and if you open
each of those up, you'll see there's

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:02.860 line:100% position:50% align:middle
another thing inside of it. This data is
so nested. Opened it up once more time,

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:07.390 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and then you see that is going to be. And
then the second one we'll say,

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:12.340 line:100% position:50% align:middle
open it up again, it keeps jumping around.
That is going to be a list of.

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:17.360 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And it tells you what the person said
and then as well as its confidence.

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:21.640 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Like this one is 89% confidence. That's
what I said. And here it's like less than

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:26.280 line:100% position:50% align:middle
a percent confident and it builds up
confidence over time as it gets to

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:30.410 line:100% position:50% align:middle
analyze it a few more times. And then
finally, there is an is final build-in

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:34.650 line:100% position:50% align:middle
here which tells us is the person done
speaking that sentence.

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:40.590 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So what we really need to do here is to
take this sort of mess of nested stuff and

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:48.900 line:100% position:50% align:middle
convert it into just a plain old string
that we can see. So let's go into here and

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:55.140 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we'll say const transcript equals
array.from and we need to convert it to an

00:06:55.140 --> 00:07:00.620 line:100% position:50% align:middle
arrayE.results because it's not an
array by default. And then we're going to

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:04.260 line:100% position:50% align:middle
just map over each of them and then just
turn it from one thing to another.

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:10.360 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So first thing I want to do is just grab
the first thing from each of them because

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:15.880 line:100% position:50% align:middle
this is the list and we need to grab the
first thing from each of them.

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:18.140 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we could actually just take.

00:07:28.229 --> 00:07:32.790 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we are going to map over it and take
the first thing that we have there.

00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:36.200 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So even if it's on it's own line and we're
going to Map the results is going to

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:41.550 line:100% position:50% align:middle
return the result [0] because that's the
first thing that is there. And then if we

00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:49.110 line:100% position:50% align:middle
console log the transcript, let's see what
we've got. "Hello, I love to pet dogs."

00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:52.570 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Let's see. Open it up. Some of them are
going to be two things.

00:07:52.570 --> 00:07:57.650 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Like this one will tell me that, "Hello, I
love." And the second thing that it gives

00:07:57.650 --> 00:08:02.677 line:100% position:50% align:middle
us is so nested, "The pet dog." And then
I'm sure that it would correct it

00:08:02.677 --> 00:08:03.703 line:100% position:50% align:middle
as we go along.

00:08:03.703 --> 00:08:11.260 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So good. Now we need to map over
that once more and return the

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:21.506 line:100% position:50% align:middle
results.transcript. "Hello, I love to pet
dogs." There we go. Look at what we've

00:08:21.610 --> 00:08:25.430 line:100% position:50% align:middle
got  here. We've got arrays coming in.
All right one more time,

00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:32.490 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"Hello, I love..." There we go. Sometimes,
LOL... How did it know that I

00:08:32.490 --> 00:08:36.650 line:100% position:50% align:middle
was actually laughing out loud?
That's amazing.

00:08:36.650 --> 00:08:40.040 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I've got an array of the different
pieces that it thinks I said.

00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:44.740 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So what we need to do finally is join
those two pieces together because we don't

00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:49.820 line:100% position:50% align:middle
want two strings or three strings or one
string. We want one big string.

00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:54.191 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So join at the end. I'm going to take
this console log out. Now when I say

00:08:54.191 --> 00:09:02.460 line:100% position:50% align:middle
something... Now when I say something,
it tells me exactly what I have.

00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:06.540 line:100% position:50% align:middle
You will notice that if you stopped
speaking and then start speaking again,

00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:11.370 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it doesn't work. And why is that? And that
is because we're listening for the result

00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:15.950 line:100% position:50% align:middle
but then once the result is finished it
doesn't, like it unbinds itself, it's no

00:09:15.950 --> 00:09:23.430 line:100% position:50% align:middle
longer listening. So what we need to do is
add a second event listener for the end

00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:29.570 line:100% position:50% align:middle
event. And when that ends, we simply just
call the function. We can just tell it.

00:09:29.570 --> 00:09:33.840 line:100% position:50% align:middle
When it ends, run the function for us
recognition.start. We don't run it here

00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:37.860 line:100% position:50% align:middle
because that would run a page load but we
just supply the name of the function that

00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:42.680 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it will then call. So if we give that a
save. Now when I start talking...

00:09:45.349 --> 00:09:51.688 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and after a break, it will start up again.
And that's because this end event

00:09:51.688 --> 00:09:54.778 line:100% position:50% align:middle
is firing which in turn is going to
add the event listener.

00:09:54.778 --> 00:09:57.289 line:100% position:50% align:middle
It's going to start listening
for it again.

00:09:57.289 --> 00:10:03.210 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Good. Now what we need to do is create a
paragraph tag where we can put these

00:10:03.210 --> 00:10:06.450 line:100% position:50% align:middle
paragraphs. Actually we already have a
paragraph tag. So right down here we

00:10:06.450 --> 00:10:15.930 line:100% position:50% align:middle
simply have to say P.text content is equal
to transcript. Now when I start talking,

00:10:15.930 --> 00:10:26.050 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we should see it in the DOM, but when I
start talking again, it overwrites it.

00:10:26.050 --> 00:10:32.160 line:100% position:50% align:middle
What's going on here? Well, what's
happening is that if I'm done with that

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:36.910 line:100% position:50% align:middle
sentence, this is going to run again and
replace it. So what we need to do is check

00:10:36.910 --> 00:10:44.670 line:100% position:50% align:middle
if the result is final. So let's say, if
E.results, the first one,

00:10:44.670 --> 00:10:49.880 line:100% position:50% align:middle
dot is final, then we need to create a new
paragraph. We are going to overwrite this

00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:54.660 line:100% position:50% align:middle
paragraph we created on page load. So
we just say P equals...nope don't put a

00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:58.020 line:100% position:50% align:middle
vowel letter in front of it. We're going
to overwrite this existing one here.

00:10:58.020 --> 00:11:09.370 line:100% position:50% align:middle
P equals document.create element P and I
will stick that sucker in the words.append

00:11:09.370 --> 00:11:11.932 line:100% position:50% align:middle
child P.

00:11:16.146 --> 00:11:21.450 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now when we talk, it should add a
paragraph and when I talk again,

00:11:21.450 --> 00:11:28.820 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it should add a second paragraph and a
third, exclamation mark.

00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:30.667 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Do you get the point?

00:11:32.249 --> 00:11:37.050 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Sweet, seems to be working. So
that is the very basics of speech

00:11:37.050 --> 00:11:40.673 line:100% position:50% align:middle
recognition that we have here it's
actually not a lot of code. What you could

00:11:40.803 --> 00:11:45.090 line:100% position:50% align:middle
do with this now is that now that we have
this transcript, you could say like if

00:11:45.090 --> 00:11:56.912 line:100% position:50% align:middle
transcript. as it contains unicorn, then
console log unicorn. Whoa.

00:12:00.982 --> 00:12:07.546 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"I love dogs." oh, it's not contains
it's includes,

00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:15.990 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"I Love dogs. I love unicorns." And when
you say the word unicorn,

00:12:15.990 --> 00:12:20.420 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it triggers it and goes off. So what
you could do is you could listen if

00:12:20.420 --> 00:12:28.320 line:100% position:50% align:middle
includes like, "Get the weather" And then
it would run a function that would also

00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:39.660 line:100% position:50% align:middle
log getting the weather. "Siri, go get the
weather." And then it will run this

00:12:39.660 --> 00:12:42.230 line:100% position:50% align:middle
getting the weather function. Obviously
you'd have to debounce that or

00:12:42.230 --> 00:12:45.460 line:100% position:50% align:middle
only run it once every so often because it
will run it multiple times,

00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:50.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
but you get the point here. I've seen
people hook this up to external weather

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:55.170 line:100% position:50% align:middle
APIs or to other functions and you can
basically have a hands-off application

00:12:55.170 --> 00:12:59.490 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that listens for what you're saying behind
the scenes and when it sees those words

00:12:59.490 --> 00:13:03.370 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that you want, it will trigger some sort
of other function. Hopefully you

00:13:03.370 --> 00:13:07.490 line:100% position:50% align:middle
enjoyed that. I would love to see what you
build with this. There is just a whole

00:13:07.490 --> 00:13:11.800 line:100% position:50% align:middle
world that opens up when you have speech
recognition. So please let me know what

00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:14.558 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you create. Thanks and
I'll see you tomorrow.
