00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:11.850 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Today we're going to be working with
JavaScript's array.sort method,

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:16.325 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and we're going to be sorting this array
of band names, but kind of the catch we

00:00:16.325 --> 00:00:24.920 line:100% position:50% align:middle
have here is that you need to sort them
without "The," "An," or "A" in front of

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:28.063 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the actual band name, because those are
articles and they don't go into

00:00:28.063 --> 00:00:32.351 line:100% position:50% align:middle
alphabetizing your actual
name of your band.

00:00:32.351 --> 00:00:35.097 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So go ahead and
pause the video. I think that you can do

00:00:35.097 --> 00:00:39.880 line:100% position:50% align:middle
this on your own, at least give it a good
shot, and try to build this where you sort

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:46.680 line:100% position:50% align:middle
this array first, and then once you've
sorted the array without "the," "an," or

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:53.490 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"a," then put them into the actual html
here, but notice how "The," "An," or "A"

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:57.880 line:100% position:50% align:middle
still come along for the ride, they're
just not affecting the sort order.

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:02.100 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So pause the video and come back when
you've given it a good shot.

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:09.500 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Welcome back. So here I am, I'm going to
first make a sortedBands variable,

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.360 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and we'll take the bands and we are going
to sort it. Now, we know that sort will

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:18.450 line:100% position:50% align:middle
take a function name that gives us a and
b, and what is a? A is going to be the

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.600 line:100% position:50% align:middle
first thing that it passes us, the b is
going to be the second.

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.880 line:100% position:50% align:middle
It's sort of like it gives you two apples
in either hand, and you're like,

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.760 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"Which one is bigger?" Then the bigger one
you move to the top,

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:30.720 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and the other one you move to the bottom.
Or the one that comes earlier in the

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.150 line:100% position:50% align:middle
alphabet you move to the top, and the
other one you put in the bottom.

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:37.220 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Then you toss the bigger one, and you get
another apple in your hand,

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.580 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and you've got that first apple from the
first bunch, and then the second apple

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.430 line:100% position:50% align:middle
from the second bunch, and you say "Which
one's bigger?" You just keep doing that

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:47.430 line:100% position:50% align:middle
over and over and over again until you
have a sorted list. That's why it always

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:48.910 line:100% position:50% align:middle
gives you two things.

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:53.990 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So normally what we do is we say "if a is
greater than b," and we can just do this,

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.750 line:100% position:50% align:middle
even though they're not numbers. It's
still going to work with strings,

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.230 line:100% position:50% align:middle
because they're alphabetical. So "if a is
bigger than b," then we will return 1,

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:12.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
else we are going to return -1. And let's
just console.log(sortedBands),

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.740 line:100% position:50% align:middle
see what we've got here. So we've got our
data and it is alphabetizing it,

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:24.860 line:100% position:50% align:middle
but it is basing it off of "A" and "The."
So what we need to do is go up here and

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:29.310 line:100% position:50% align:middle
create a new function that I like to call
strip, and it's going to take in the

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.650 line:100% position:50% align:middle
bandName, and then from there we are going
to return the bandName,

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:41.330 line:100% position:50% align:middle
but we are going to replace the word
"The," or "A," or "An." So one way that we

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:46.360 line:100% position:50% align:middle
could replace all three in one go is to
use a regular expression,

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.150 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and we can say when it starts with, that's
what the caret is for,

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:54.030 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and I'm by no means a regular expression
expert, if you know anything about regex

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:57.960 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you can probably find a better way to do
this, but the way that I've done it is you

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:04.010 line:100% position:50% align:middle
can say "a," "the," or "an," and you want
to make that insensitive.

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:10.080 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So it's going to match "an," or "An," or
"AN," so there we go.

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.580 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I'm sure there's a flag you can pass so
you don't need that space in there,

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:17.300 line:100% position:50% align:middle
where you could say just match a whole
word. What I'm trying to do is make sure

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:21.080 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that we don't catch this, where some word
like "Anywhere" starts with "An," but

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:26.950 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that's not actually the article, "An." So
we are replacing. Make sure you spell

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:30.580 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"replace" right, and we are going to be
replacing that with nothing,

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:35.980 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and then we'll just call trim on the end
there just in case we have any spaces

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:38.260 line:100% position:50% align:middle
after it. Good.

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.169 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Then, what we can do...
Let's see if that works, actually.

00:03:41.169 --> 00:03:48.760 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So if I call that strip function
from the console, say "An old dog," it

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:55.080 line:100% position:50% align:middle
returns to you "old dog," "anold dog,"
"arnold dog," it won't do it,

00:03:55.080 --> 00:04:00.430 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"The old dog" will give you "old dog."
Good. So that function is working.

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:06.240 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now what we can do is we simply just
change our if statement to a strip and

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:12.110 line:100% position:50% align:middle
strip, and notice how we are only using
strip in the if statement,

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:15.790 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and we're not actually going to be
modifying this data. So the data that we

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:19.780 line:100% position:50% align:middle
use to decide where it goes is not
necessarily the data that is going to be

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:23.400 line:100% position:50% align:middle
in the array. So we're using strip, now
let's see where we're at.

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:28.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Good, Anywhere But Here, The Bled,
Counterparts, The Devil Wears Prada,

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.700 line:100% position:50% align:middle
good. So now it's totally ignoring it. We
can make this a lot easier here,

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:39.210 line:100% position:50% align:middle
so first of all what we can do, we could
simply just make it return,

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:44.570 line:100% position:50% align:middle
strip (a) > strip (b), if that is true we
return 1, otherwise we return -1,

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:50.360 line:100% position:50% align:middle
so we're just using a ternary operator
there. Still works good.

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:58.700 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We can make this an arrow function, good,
still works, and now you see my editor's

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:02.210 line:100% position:50% align:middle
yelling at me because it's... If the only
thing you're doing in a function is

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:06.260 line:100% position:50% align:middle
returning something, you can use the
implicit return. So I'm going to take off

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:11.600 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that bracket and the semicolon, take of
this bracket, going to put it on the same

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:16.638 line:100% position:50% align:middle
line, and I'm going to remove the return
keyword, and that's doing the exact same

00:05:16.638 --> 00:05:19.620 line:100% position:50% align:middle
thing, just in one hot line.

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:25.080 line:100% position:50% align:middle
There we go, working good. So we have the
bands.sort, and now we will go ahead and

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:37.518 line:100% position:50% align:middle
grab our bands, which is here, say
document.querySelector('#bands'.

00:05:37.518 --> 00:05:44.587 line:100% position:50% align:middle
)innerHTML equals, we'll take our
sortedBands, and we are going to loop over

00:05:44.587 --> 00:05:50.693 line:100% position:50% align:middle
each of them. So we'll use map, and from
that map we will return the band,

00:05:50.693 --> 00:05:56.243 line:100% position:50% align:middle
but the band in a list item, and then
we will join it all in one go.

00:05:56.243 --> 00:06:01.750 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So what does that do, it takes the element
and sets the innerHTML to b,

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:05.360 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and we can put this on its own line,
sortedBands, but we want to map over each

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:09.530 line:100% position:50% align:middle
of those, and then that's going to return
an array, so we want to join it.

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:12.460 line:100% position:50% align:middle
See where we're at...there we go. Anywhere
But Here, The Bled,

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:15.390 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we're got everything being dumped into the
DOM there.

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:19.830 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Let me show you real quick, if I take that
join off, you'll notice that we get these

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:25.050 line:100% position:50% align:middle
commas showing up here, and that's because
what happens is we have this sortedBands

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:30.310 line:100% position:50% align:middle
array, which is everything, and if you
were to call .toString on it,

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:36.760 line:100% position:50% align:middle
then that's exactly what the DOM will do.
When you try to set something to innerHTML

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:41.890 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that is not a string, like an array, then
it will just call .toString on it,

00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:45.490 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and by default it's going to put a comma
in between each one. So we need to put

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:55.670 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that .join on the end so that will join it
into one big string rather than a bunch of

00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:58.240 line:100% position:50% align:middle
strings with a comma in between.

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:02.040 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So let's double check that, working great.
Hopefully you enjoyed that,

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:03.681 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I will see you tomorrow.
