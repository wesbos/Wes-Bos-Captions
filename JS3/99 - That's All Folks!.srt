You did it. Congratu-freaking-lations.
You killed it. You did all 30 days.

00:00:12.753 --> 00:00:14,857 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Or, you're just watching this video.
For some reason, you want to see

00:00:14.857 --> 00:00:19,065 line:100% position:50% align:middle
what the last video is.
Don't do that. That's a jerk move.

00:00:19.065 --> 00:00:21,789 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Great job. I'm really proud of you
for doing all 30 days.

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:25,070 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And what I want to leave you with is
sort of some motivation to keep going.

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:28,233 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Keep building more stuff. I said a
1,000 things is what you've got to

00:00:28.233 --> 00:00:32,890 line:100% position:50% align:middle
build. Well, you've got 970 left.
You're just getting started with

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:36,552 line:100% position:50% align:middle
this sort of thing.
So how do you keep it going?

00:00:36.552 --> 00:00:39,602 line:100% position:50% align:middle
For some people, the best way
is to just start teaching others.

00:00:39.602 --> 00:00:42,935 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So help other people out
on this course. Write a blog post.

00:00:42.935 --> 00:00:46,977 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Create a YouTube tutorial, whatever it is.
The way that I got into this stuff is

00:00:46.977 --> 00:00:49,760 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I initially started blogging and
putting up tutorials on YouTube.

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:56,380 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And it really helped me solidify my skills
by having to explain it to other people.

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:01,390 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So being involved in open-source doesn't
just mean building these frameworks.

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:04,460 line:100% position:50% align:middle
There's a lot of really smart people
that are out there building frameworks and

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08,000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
libraries and plugins and all that stuff.
But if that's not really where you're at

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11,700 line:100% position:50% align:middle
right now, where I think you can
contribute is by sharing what you

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14,140 line:100% position:50% align:middle
know. You just learned a whole
bunch of stuff in this course.

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17,280 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now turn around, start telling other
people about it. Share it.

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21,780 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Make lots of examples for everybody.
Really, keep it up. Keep building stuff.

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25,710 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Don't let this stop you. You've got 970
more things to build. Thanks a lot.

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28,024 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And I will see you in my next course.
