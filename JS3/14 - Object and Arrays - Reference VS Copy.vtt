Today we are going to talk all
about Javascript reference versus copy.

00:00:11.129 --> 00:00:15.190 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And I found this to be a sticking point
and while it's not necessarily going to be

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:17.730 line:100% position:50% align:middle
something that you're going to build
that's going to be sweet and your clients

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.840 line:100% position:50% align:middle
are going to see it, but this is something
that is fundamental to understanding how

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:25.321 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Javascript works. And more often than not,
this is a source of a lot of bugs because

00:00:25.321 --> 00:00:28.690 line:100% position:50% align:middle
people don't understand what the
difference between a reference and a copy

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:33.350 line:100% position:50% align:middle
is especially when you get into
nested data. So let's take a look at some

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:38.040 line:100% position:50% align:middle
strings, numbers, and booleans right here.
If I have a variable or let's use let

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.370 line:100% position:50% align:middle
here, and age is set to 100 and then I
make another variable called age 2 and set

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:46.970 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that to age, if I console log age and
age 2, what are we going to get?

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:51.106 line:100% position:50% align:middle
100 and 100, right? Well, what
happens if age is equal to 200?

00:00:51.106 --> 00:00:54.490 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And then I also console log age and
age 2, what are we going to get?

00:00:54.490 --> 00:01:01.112 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Are we going to get 200, 200 or 200, 100?
Okay good. No we get 200, 100.

00:01:01.112 --> 00:01:06.511 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Why? Because the value of age goes
into the variable at the same time.

00:01:06.511 --> 00:01:14.013 line:100% position:50% align:middle
That works the same way with strings.
If I do const name or let,

00:01:14.013 --> 00:01:20.245 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I'm going to be reassigning these so I
need to use let Wes and let name two is

00:01:20.245 --> 00:01:29.305 line:100% position:50% align:middle
equal to pool. No let name two is equal to
name. Console log name and name two.

00:01:29.305 --> 00:01:34.760 line:100% position:50% align:middle
You probably will see Wes Wes
but if name is equal to Wesley,

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:39.010 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and we also console log that, what
are we going to get? Wesley Wes.

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:43.582 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Okay good. So the value of strings,
numbers, and booleans go into it and if

00:01:43.582 --> 00:01:48.346 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you change the original one, it's okay.
It's not going to update the other one.

00:01:48.346 --> 00:01:52.229 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Makes sense.
Now let's actually work with an array.

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:57.511 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Let's say we've got some data here and we
want to make a copy of the array so we

00:01:57.511 --> 00:02:01.555 line:100% position:50% align:middle
say, const team equals players.
And that should make sense.

00:02:01.555 --> 00:02:06.606 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Console log players and team, just to
make sure we got both of them here,

00:02:06.606 --> 00:02:10.616 line:100% position:50% align:middle
okay good. That's the same array here. So
you might think that we could do something

00:02:10.616 --> 00:02:21.129 line:100% position:50% align:middle
like this where we changed team three
is equal to locks. Now if I look at team,

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:27.083 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you'll see locks is the last one but if I
look at the original one which is players,

00:02:27.083 --> 00:02:31.470 line:100% position:50% align:middle
which should the last one be? Should it
poppy as it was, or is it going to be

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:37.076 line:100% position:50% align:middle
updated to locks? It's locks again.
So what happened there?

00:02:37.076 --> 00:02:44.428 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Because we updated team but team is not
the array. Team is just a reference to the

00:02:44.428 --> 00:02:49.506 line:100% position:50% align:middle
original array which is players. So when
you edit that original array or when you

00:02:49.506 --> 00:02:54.729 line:100% position:50% align:middle
update any of the arrays, it's always
going to go back to the reference where it

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:59.844 line:100% position:50% align:middle
was which is not the same as what
we did here with numbers, strings,

00:02:59.844 --> 00:03:04.069 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and booleans. So that's interesting.
If you update an array,

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:07.537 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it will always reference back.
And that is what I find people do is

00:03:07.537 --> 00:03:13.417 line:100% position:50% align:middle
say, "I just want to make a copy of the
array and update it." So what we then need

00:03:13.417 --> 00:03:18.981 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to do is make a copy rather than a actual
reference. And there's a couple of ways

00:03:18.981 --> 00:03:26.236 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that you can make a copy of an array. Say
const team two equals and you can take the

00:03:26.236 --> 00:03:32.599 line:100% position:50% align:middle
players and just call slice against it.
And if you call slice, players.slice

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:36.495 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that's just going to return the
entire array because generally

00:03:36.495 --> 00:03:40.745 line:100% position:50% align:middle
what slice does is you ask for two
and three and that will give you one

00:03:40.745 --> 00:03:46.845 line:100% position:50% align:middle
of them whereas the original array is
untouched, right? But what slice will do

00:03:46.845 --> 00:03:50.927 line:100% position:50% align:middle
if you pass at nothing is it will take a
copy of the actual array here.

00:03:50.927 --> 00:03:54.733 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Let me just comment out this changing
up here. So let's take a look.

00:03:54.733 --> 00:04:01.691 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We got players, and we have team two,
and if I were to change team two to

00:04:01.691 --> 00:04:09.954 line:100% position:50% align:middle
locks, team two has locks in it but
players still has poppy because we made a

00:04:09.954 --> 00:04:15.842 line:100% position:50% align:middle
copy of it with our array. Another way you
can see people do it is if we make a team

00:04:15.842 --> 00:04:23.726 line:100% position:50% align:middle
three, you take a blank array and you can
concatenate in the existing array and that

00:04:23.726 --> 00:04:27.231 line:100% position:50% align:middle
will just concatenate all of the
items from that player's array into the

00:04:27.231 --> 00:04:31.236 line:100% position:50% align:middle
emptier right here. That will work the
exact same way. And then finally

00:04:31.236 --> 00:04:36.606 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we can do is the ES6 spread way
which looks like this, const team

00:04:36.606 --> 00:04:44.328 line:100% position:50% align:middle
three or four equals, you create a
new array, and you spread into that

00:04:44.328 --> 00:04:49.366 line:100% position:50% align:middle
array with the players. And what a spread
will do is it will take every item out of

00:04:49.366 --> 00:04:55.752 line:100% position:50% align:middle
your iterable and put it into, in this
case it's the containing array although we

00:04:55.752 --> 00:04:59.881 line:100% position:50% align:middle
have also used spread to spread into a
function as well. So that will take

00:04:59.881 --> 00:05:09.444 line:100% position:50% align:middle
a copy of it just as well. Team four,
the last one equal to E and console

00:05:09.444 --> 00:05:16.148 line:100% position:50% align:middle
log team four. The last one but if I go
back to my player's array, it's untouched

00:05:16.148 --> 00:05:23.458 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Then finally you could say const
team five is equal to array.from and then

00:05:23.458 --> 00:05:29.360 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you pass it, your player's array. And if
we were to look at team five,

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:32.440 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that's our array, and we were
to change one of them,

00:05:36.306 --> 00:05:42.390 line:100% position:50% align:middle
then player's array untouched whereas
team five has been updated.

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:46.908 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So a whole bunch of different ways.
Array.from and the spread is probably my

00:05:46.908 --> 00:05:52.014 line:100% position:50% align:middle
favorite way but any of these ways will
work just fine. Now, the same thing

00:05:52.014 --> 00:05:57.976 line:100% position:50% align:middle
happens for objects as well. If I have a
person object here and I want to make a

00:05:57.976 --> 00:06:03.221 line:100% position:50% align:middle
copy of it, you cannot do this const
captain equals person because

00:06:03.221 --> 00:06:13.339 line:100% position:50% align:middle
if you change the captain's number to 99,
so person is now 99 even though person

00:06:13.339 --> 00:06:21.411 line:100% position:50% align:middle
should be 80, we just update the number to
99, we made a reference to the original

00:06:21.411 --> 00:06:25.146 line:100% position:50% align:middle
one. So how do you take a copy instead,
that is with something called

00:06:25.146 --> 00:06:30.099 line:100% position:50% align:middle
object.assigns. Object.assign, the way
that it works, is you start with a blank

00:06:30.099 --> 00:06:35.717 line:100% position:50% align:middle
object. You pass it the object
you wish to copy all the properties from

00:06:35.717 --> 00:06:42.466 line:100% position:50% align:middle
which is person, and then you sort of fold
in your new properties that you wish to

00:06:42.466 --> 00:06:47.050 line:100% position:50% align:middle
overwrite which is number is going to be
99. And then you stick that entire thing

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:53.536 line:100% position:50% align:middle
in your own const cap two equals,
stick it into its own variable.

00:06:53.536 --> 00:06:59.644 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now when you console log cap two, you'll
see we have... I've got to comment these

00:06:59.644 --> 00:07:07.924 line:100% position:50% align:middle
ones out here, 99. However if I go back
to person, the number has not been

00:07:07.924 --> 00:07:12.041 line:100% position:50% align:middle
added to that one at all. So if we just
added them in...same goes if I wanted to

00:07:12.041 --> 00:07:20.047 line:100% position:50% align:middle
have a number of 99 in age of 12. The
captain is now 12 but the person is 80.

00:07:20.047 --> 00:07:24.947 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So what happened there is we'd take a
blank object, we overwrite or we sort of

00:07:24.947 --> 00:07:29.531 line:100% position:50% align:middle
fold in all of the properties and values
from our object, and then we use the third

00:07:29.531 --> 00:07:34.447 line:100% position:50% align:middle
argument to fold in our own ones.
We are going to be getting or

00:07:34.447 --> 00:07:40.134 line:100% position:50% align:middle
hopefully, it's not confirmed yet, but we
will be getting a cap three which is

00:07:40.134 --> 00:07:44.825 line:100% position:50% align:middle
called an object spread. And you may be
used to this if you've ever done any react

00:07:44.825 --> 00:07:49.922 line:100% position:50% align:middle
before and it's dot dot dot person. And
that works exactly the same way as we

00:07:49.922 --> 00:07:55.335 line:100% position:50% align:middle
spread into an array but you can spread
into an object. Now one thing that we do

00:07:55.335 --> 00:08:00.451 line:100% position:50% align:middle
need to know is this is very shallow,
meaning that it will only ever go one

00:08:00.451 --> 00:08:04.827 line:100% position:50% align:middle
level deep. So if we create
a new object here, const

00:08:04.827 --> 00:08:13.639 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Wes equals name is Wes, age is 100,
and maybe it will say social and Twitter

00:08:13.639 --> 00:08:24.104 line:100% position:50% align:middle
is equal to @wesbos, Facebook is equal to
Wesbos...okay good then I've got this

00:08:24.104 --> 00:08:32.118 line:100% position:50% align:middle
object here, Wes. Pop a quick
console.clear above it so it

00:08:32.118 --> 00:08:36.331 line:100% position:50% align:middle
will clear out whatever is in here.
Obviously this is not going to work dot

00:08:36.331 --> 00:08:40.305 line:100% position:50% align:middle
dot dot why? Because object's spread is
not in Javascript yet so we have to

00:08:40.305 --> 00:08:43.615 line:100% position:50% align:middle
comment that out. There we go. So we've
got this object here. That's the person.

00:08:43.615 --> 00:08:49.082 line:100% position:50% align:middle
You open up social and we have the object
there. Now if I want to make a copy of

00:08:49.082 --> 00:08:58.046 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Wes, we would say const div equals object
dot assign. We take a blank object and you

00:08:58.046 --> 00:09:02.510 line:100% position:50% align:middle
pass in Wes we have here.
Good. So now I have div, that's good,

00:09:02.510 --> 00:09:12.581 line:100% position:50% align:middle
div.name equals Wesley. Now Wes is still
Wes and dev is Wesley.

00:09:12.581 --> 00:09:16.861 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So you see how we took a copy of that
object and when we update it,

00:09:16.861 --> 00:09:20.313 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it's not going to update the original one
so it's not a reference.

00:09:20.313 --> 00:09:29.306 line:100% position:50% align:middle
However what if we do this,
div.social.twitter is equal to

00:09:29.306 --> 00:09:37.803 line:100% position:50% align:middle
@poolman. Now div.social, the
Twitter is there but what if I look at

00:09:37.803 --> 00:09:45.190 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Wes.social now? Shit. Look what happen.
Because when you use object.assign,

00:09:45.190 --> 00:09:52.292 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it only does one level deep. If you need
to do a clone, you have to get out a

00:09:52.292 --> 00:09:57.102 line:100% position:50% align:middle
function and go online and find it where
it's called clone deep and that will clone

00:09:57.102 --> 00:10:00.195 line:100% position:50% align:middle
every level as deep as you want. Although
before you do that, you should

00:10:00.195 --> 00:10:04.384 line:100% position:50% align:middle
ask yourself, "Do I really actually need
to do this? Maybe I could be doing it in a

00:10:04.384 --> 00:10:08.235 line:100% position:50% align:middle
better spot because very rarely do you
actually need to clone an object that

00:10:08.235 --> 00:10:12.194 line:100% position:50% align:middle
deep." So we have that.
And then another sort of cheating way,

00:10:12.194 --> 00:10:16.543 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the poor man's deep clone, and I'm not
recommending this but you could say const

00:10:16.543 --> 00:10:24.996 line:100% position:50% align:middle
div two equals Jason.parse,
Jason.stringify then you pass it your

00:10:24.996 --> 00:10:35.507 line:100% position:50% align:middle
person. Now we have div two and
then we say divtwo.social.twitter equals

00:10:35.507 --> 00:10:43.485 line:100% position:50% align:middle
@poolman. And now if we look at
Wes.social, it has not been touched.

00:10:43.485 --> 00:10:50.928 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Why? Because what you can do is you can
take Jason.stringify and pass it an

00:10:50.928 --> 00:10:55.113 line:100% position:50% align:middle
object, and that will return to you a
string. That's no longer an object.

00:10:55.113 --> 00:10:59.392 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And then you immediately Jason.parse it to
turn it back into an object,

00:10:59.392 --> 00:11:04.382 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and then you get a full copy of
it rather than and you shake all the
