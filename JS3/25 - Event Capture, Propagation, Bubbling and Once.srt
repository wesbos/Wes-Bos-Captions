00:00:07.698 --> 00:00:12,755 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Quick, short, and sweet lesson today, and
it's going to be about .addEventListener.

00:00:12.755 --> 00:00:16,220 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We're not going to be building anything
huge here, but there's a couple concepts

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:20,210 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that I need to make sure that we all get
down pat, because we've been using these

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:24,120 line:100% position:50% align:middle
.addEventListeners throughout all these
videos, but there's going to be edge cases

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:29,220 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that you run into where these things are
going to be helpful. So what I've got here

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33,915 line:100% position:50% align:middle
is I've got three divs. I've got a div
with a class of one, two, and three.

00:00:33.915 --> 00:00:38,186 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and they're all nested inside
of each other. What I want to do is

00:00:38.186 --> 00:00:44,592 line:100% position:50% align:middle
explain to you a couple things about
propagation, bubbling, event capturing,

00:00:44.592 --> 00:00:50,813 line:100% position:50% align:middle
as well as using this new property called
once. So go into your scrip tag here,

00:00:50.813 --> 00:00:54,317 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and I want to just listen for a click on
all of these divs, so we're going to

00:00:54.317 --> 00:00:59,628 line:100% position:50% align:middle
select all those divs, and we're going to
make a function called logText.

00:00:59.628 --> 00:01:05,735 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Fix in the event, and we're just going to
console.log(this.classList.value).

00:01:05.735 --> 00:01:07,274 line:100% position:50% align:middle
When somebody clicks a div,

00:01:07.274 --> 00:01:11,079 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we're going to log it, so we'll say take
all the divs, loop over each one,

00:01:11.079 --> 00:01:16,516 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we're going to take the div, and we're
going to add.EventListener click,

00:01:16.516 --> 00:01:20,890 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and when that happens, we're going
to call LogText. This is the one...

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:24,960 line:100% position:50% align:middle
You may see me autocompleting this, and
we have this capture?: boolean right here.

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27,834 line:100% position:50% align:middle
That's really what we're going to be
looking at here today, we'll leave that

00:01:27.834 --> 00:01:30,491 line:100% position:50% align:middle
there for now. So give it a save.

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:36,660 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now, I'm going to click on, and obviously
this purple one is div with a class of

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:43,560 line:100% position:50% align:middle
one, the misty rose one is two, and the
coral one is three. So when I click on the

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47,420 line:100% position:50% align:middle
coral one, what is going to log? Don't
cheat, just tell yourself what will

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:53,750 line:100% position:50% align:middle
console that log? Click it, three, two,
and one. Wait, I just clicked on the third

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:59,608 line:100% position:50% align:middle
one, which is the very most inner one,
but I also console.logged two and one.

00:02:00.384 --> 00:02:03,610 line:100% position:50% align:middle
That's weird. Well, also if you
console.log this, you'll see the actual

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:09,028 line:100% position:50% align:middle
elements themselves, three, two,
and one. So what's going on here?

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:12,510 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Well, what is happening is if we go
to our Elements panel here,

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:17,079 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and we go to the div that we clicked on,
we clicked on three, but we really also

00:02:17.079 --> 00:02:20,373 line:100% position:50% align:middle
clicked on two, because it wraps around
it, and we also clicked on one,

00:02:20.373 --> 00:02:25,150 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we also clicked on the body, we also
clicked on the html tag, we also clicked

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:29,600 line:100% position:50% align:middle
on the current tab, and we also clicked on
Google Chrome, and we also clicked on our

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33,520 line:100% position:50% align:middle
OS X operating system, and we also clicked
on the world, and it just keeps zooming

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:38,182 line:100% position:50% align:middle
out and out and out. So that's the
concept of something called bubbling,

00:02:38.182 --> 00:02:43,358 line:100% position:50% align:middle
where the browser will figure out what
you clicked on, but it will also trigger

00:02:43.358 --> 00:02:48,970 line:100% position:50% align:middle
clicks up every...and they'll ripple
all the way up. So case in point,

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:58,460 line:100% position:50% align:middle
if I take document.body and I add the
EventListener of click, and when that

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:03,634 line:100% position:50% align:middle
happens, I'm going to logText, and we
have to give our body a class here,

00:03:03.634 --> 00:03:07,745 line:100% position:50% align:middle
so class="bod". Now watch, I'm
going to click on the coral one,

00:03:07.745 --> 00:03:13,700 line:100% position:50% align:middle
three, two, one, and bod. So what's
happening is that when you make a click,

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:19,010 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it will ripple all the way up to the top
of the document and trigger clicks on

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:22,690 line:100% position:50% align:middle
those elements as well. Now, you don't
always see them, because you're not

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:26,408 line:100% position:50% align:middle
necessarily listening for a click on those
elements, but if you're listening for

00:03:26.408 --> 00:03:30,555 line:100% position:50% align:middle
a click on multiple nested elements, in
this case, we're listening for a click on

00:03:30.555 --> 00:03:35,486 line:100% position:50% align:middle
three, two, one, and bod, then
it's going to trigger a click

00:03:35.486 --> 00:03:37,800 line:100% position:50% align:middle
on all of those, right there.

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:41,724 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So I want to explain to you how this
actually works in JavaScript.

00:03:41.724 --> 00:03:47,552 line:100% position:50% align:middle
The way that it works in modern
browsers is that the browser will first

00:03:47.552 --> 00:03:51,407 line:100% position:50% align:middle
do something called a capture, which
means that when you click on the element,

00:03:51.407 --> 00:03:56,029 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it's going to ripple down. It's going to
say, "Okay, you clicked on the body,

00:03:56.029 --> 00:04:00,400 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you clicked on one, you clicked on two,
and you clicked on three." So it actually

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:04,964 line:100% position:50% align:middle
goes from the top down, and then it
captures all of those events,

00:04:04.964 --> 00:04:09,732 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and then it starts at the bottom, and then
starts doing something called a bubble.

00:04:09.732 --> 00:04:14,594 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So the capture goes from top down, and
then the events...the events haven't fired

00:04:14.594 --> 00:04:19,019 line:100% position:50% align:middle
yet. It just captures where you clicked,
and is storing them. Then it will start to

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:23,510 line:100% position:50% align:middle
bubble up, which means that it's
triggering the events as you go up.

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:27,363 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So it says, "Okay, we've done figuring out
what you've clicked on all the way down,

00:04:27.363 --> 00:04:31,684 line:100% position:50% align:middle
now I'm going to start firing off
those click events," on three,

00:04:31.684 --> 00:04:36,960 line:100% position:50% align:middle
then two, then one, then body, and
anything else you're listening for.

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:41,630 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So if we go to our .addEventListener here,
and let's get rid of this document.body

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:44,620 line:100% position:50% align:middle
here, after our function [inaudible
00:04:43] a third argument,

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:50,707 line:100% position:50% align:middle
which is an options object, and we say
capture is going to be equal to true,

00:04:50.707 --> 00:04:55,817 line:100% position:50% align:middle
what that will then do is when I click, we
go one, two, three, and what's happening

00:04:55.817 --> 00:05:01,277 line:100% position:50% align:middle
is that this function, logText, is not
going to get run on the bubble up,

00:05:01.277 --> 00:05:05,437 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it's going to get run on the capture down.
So we go to the Elements here,

00:05:05.437 --> 00:05:09,181 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it's going to say, "Oh, they clicked on
one, fire it. They clicked on two,

00:05:09.181 --> 00:05:13,909 line:100% position:50% align:middle
fire it. They clicked on three, fire it."
So that is what capture means

00:05:13.909 --> 00:05:20,127 line:100% position:50% align:middle
is that we will run the function on the
way down rather than on the way up.

00:05:20.127 --> 00:05:24,947 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now let me put that back to false. By
default, it is false, so that's the normal

00:05:24.947 --> 00:05:26,416 line:100% position:50% align:middle
version that we have here.

00:05:26.416 --> 00:05:30,435 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Another thing we have is called stop
propagation. So we just talked about

00:05:30.435 --> 00:05:34,751 line:100% position:50% align:middle
events bubble up, meaning that if you
click on the innermost one,

00:05:34.751 --> 00:05:40,407 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it will also trigger an event on the
parent and that parent as well.

00:05:40.407 --> 00:05:44,591 line:100% position:50% align:middle
However, what you could then do is
you take your event in your function,

00:05:44.591 --> 00:05:50,960 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and you call e.stopPropagation(),
and what that will do is it will say,

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:56,135 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"Stop bubbling this event up. I clicked
the one that I actually wanted."

00:05:56.135 --> 00:06:01,432 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So now if I go in here, and click on
the middle one, I just see three,

00:06:01.432 --> 00:06:07,990 line:100% position:50% align:middle
then two, and then one. Why is that?
Because we run... What happens is the

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:13,778 line:100% position:50% align:middle
browser starts at the very lowest one,
it runs that function, and then we say

00:06:13.778 --> 00:06:20,952 line:100% position:50% align:middle
stopPropagation, which essentially means
stop bubbling! and it will no longer

00:06:20.952 --> 00:06:25,680 line:100% position:50% align:middle
trigger events on the parents on the way
on up. So that's stopPropagation. You can

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:28,607 line:100% position:50% align:middle
wrap that in an if statement if
you needed to get the middle one,

00:06:28.607 --> 00:06:33,060 line:100% position:50% align:middle
or something like that, but that's what
stopPropagation does. You can also use

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:38,280 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that in conjunction with your on your way
down, right here, if I were to click on

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:44,314 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the middle one, or sorry, if I were to
click on three, what are we going to get

00:06:44.314 --> 00:06:51,257 line:100% position:50% align:middle
with capture: true and stopPropagation?
Just one. Why? Because capture makes it go

00:06:51.257 --> 00:06:56,757 line:100% position:50% align:middle
on the way down, one, and then we run
stopPropagation, which stops it from

00:06:56.757 --> 00:06:59,013 line:100% position:50% align:middle
going down even further.

00:06:59.013 --> 00:07:02,844 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Last thing I wanted to show you was
something called once, and this is very

00:07:02.844 --> 00:07:06,505 line:100% position:50% align:middle
new in the browser we have here. So I'm
just going to console.log that propagation

00:07:06.505 --> 00:07:11,952 line:100% position:50% align:middle
out and bring this capture back to false,
just so we can get our defaults going back

00:07:11.952 --> 00:07:16,926 line:100% position:50% align:middle
here, three, two, one. We also have an
option called once. If you set that to

00:07:16.926 --> 00:07:22,390 line:100% position:50% align:middle
true, what will happen is it will listen
for a click and then unbind itself,

00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:25,814 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and unbinding itself is
the same thing as saying

00:07:25.814 --> 00:07:33,119 line:100% position:50% align:middle
div.removeEvent.Listener('click', logText.

00:07:33.119 --> 00:07:37,909 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So it will listen for a click once,
and then unbind itself

00:07:37.909 --> 00:07:42,126 line:100% position:50% align:middle
so that there's no future clicks on it.
Now if I click on one of these here,

00:07:42.126 --> 00:07:48,027 line:100% position:50% align:middle
here we go, I'm clicking as many as I can.
It ran once, it fired all those events,

00:07:48.027 --> 00:07:53,278 line:100% position:50% align:middle
but it will never run again, until I rerun
the page. So that could be helpful if

00:07:53.278 --> 00:07:56,685 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you have a button. Let's just make
ourselves a quick button here,

00:07:56.685 --> 00:08:03,792 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and we'll grab it, and you only ever
wanted somebody to click that button once,

00:08:03.792 --> 00:08:09,545 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we just say button.addEventListener click,
and then when that happens we'll run

00:08:09.545 --> 00:08:13,639 line:100% position:50% align:middle
a quick function here that just
console.logs click, watch this.

00:08:13.639 --> 00:08:17,000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we've got this button, if I click it
over and over and over and over,

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18,030 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we're going to get it,

00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:23,410 line:100% position:50% align:middle
but if I were to add that third options
argument here, where we have once

00:08:23.410 --> 00:08:29,174 line:100% position:50% align:middle
is equal to true, I should only be able
to click this once and never again.

00:08:29.174 --> 00:08:34,066 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And where I've used that specifically is
in store checkouts, where you do not wish

00:08:34.066 --> 00:08:40,174 line:100% position:50% align:middle
for someone to click that button more than
once, you can unbind it and stop them from

00:08:40.174 --> 00:08:41,920 line:100% position:50% align:middle
clicking it multiple times.

00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:45,738 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So hopefully you learned a few things
there. I know that propagation and

00:08:45.738 --> 00:08:51,058 line:100% position:50% align:middle
bubbling and capturing, all of those words
used to be very, very confusing to me.

00:08:51.058 --> 00:08:55,580 line:100% position:50% align:middle
It's not something you use every day, so
it's one of those things where you just

00:08:55.580 --> 00:08:58,977 line:100% position:50% align:middle
sort of put off from learning, so
hopefully, you spent a couple minutes

00:08:58.977 --> 00:09:02,790 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and just learned exactly what propagation
and bubbling and all of that stuff does.

00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:04,382 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Thanks, and I'll see you tomorrow.
