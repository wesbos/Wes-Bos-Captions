(light music)

2
00:00:02.919 --> 00:00:04.722
<v Instructor>In an earlier video, I showed you</v>

3
00:00:04.722 --> 00:00:06.217
actually something that looked like this:

4
00:00:06.217 --> 00:00:10.175
if a, b, and c, and we can call the includes method on it

5
00:00:10.175 --> 00:00:13.507
and check if something is included in that array.

6
00:00:13.507 --> 00:00:17.674
That is actually half of what is called ES 2016, or ES 7.

7
00:00:19.284 --> 00:00:21.412
Really, we only got that one method,

8
00:00:21.412 --> 00:00:22.582
which is array includes,

9
00:00:22.582 --> 00:00:24.294
and then the other thing that we got

10
00:00:24.294 --> 00:00:26.071
was an exponential operator.

11
00:00:26.071 --> 00:00:29.036
So, if you have three to the power of three,

12
00:00:29.036 --> 00:00:30.303
it looks a little something like this:

13
00:00:30.303 --> 00:00:31.895
three times times three,

14
00:00:31.895 --> 00:00:33.270
and previously the way that we did that

15
00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.174
is we say Math.pow, and you can pass it three and three,

16
00:00:38.174 --> 00:00:40.262
and it's gonna give you the same result.

17
00:00:40.262 --> 00:00:41.747
Kind of the nice thing about that is if you have

18
00:00:41.747 --> 00:00:44.473
two to the power of two to the power of two,

19
00:00:44.473 --> 00:00:45.672
that will give you 16,

20
00:00:45.672 --> 00:00:48.076
whereas if we have Math.pow,

21
00:00:48.076 --> 00:00:51.076
you cannot give it a third argument.

22
00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.044
It will just ignore that third one,

23
00:00:54.044 --> 00:00:56.137
so you had to maybe wrap that

24
00:00:56.137 --> 00:00:58.183
in a second Math.pow,

25
00:00:58.183 --> 00:00:59.850
and give it another.

26
00:01:01.103 --> 00:01:02.051
See, I'm screwing up here,

27
00:01:02.051 --> 00:01:04.134
'cause it's very hard to actually run.

28
00:01:04.134 --> 00:01:07.262
So, times times is to the power of,

29
00:01:07.262 --> 00:01:10.298
and includes is looks inside of an array.

30
00:01:10.298 --> 00:01:12.552
That's all of ES 7 that we have.

31
00:01:12.552 --> 00:01:14.543
That's the end of this video.
