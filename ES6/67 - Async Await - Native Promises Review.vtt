00:00:03.073 --> 00:00:05.403
<v Instructor>Alright, let's do a quick review of Promises.</v>

2
00:00:05.403 --> 00:00:07.647
I know we went through Promises in some earlier videos

3
00:00:07.647 --> 00:00:09.168
but if you're just checking out these videos

4
00:00:09.168 --> 00:00:11.046
because they're updated for async/await,

5
00:00:11.046 --> 00:00:12.296
we're going to do a quick review and

6
00:00:12.296 --> 00:00:14.055
it's also going to set the stage for us

7
00:00:14.055 --> 00:00:17.498
refactoring some Promise code into async/await

8
00:00:17.498 --> 00:00:19.717
so first we're going to start off with some native Promises,

9
00:00:19.717 --> 00:00:21.168
things that are built into the browser

10
00:00:21.168 --> 00:00:22.280
then we're going to look at building

11
00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:24.720
some of our own Promise based functions.

12
00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.825
Now, a lot of the browser APIs that are coming out

13
00:00:27.825 --> 00:00:30.928
that are new, they are all Promise based,

14
00:00:30.928 --> 00:00:32.789
meaning that you don't have to have a success

15
00:00:32.789 --> 00:00:34.124
in error call back anymore.

16
00:00:34.124 --> 00:00:37.157
They all return a Promise and we use either

17
00:00:37.157 --> 00:00:40.754
then then then catch or async/await try-catch,

18
00:00:40.754 --> 00:00:42.291
to be able to deal with them.

19
00:00:42.291 --> 00:00:45.514
So, let's start off with the fetch APIs,

20
00:00:45.514 --> 00:00:48.717
probably the, not the first but one of the most popular APIs

21
00:00:48.717 --> 00:00:51.566
that have come along for completing AJAX request.

22
00:00:51.566 --> 00:00:53.810
So we're gonna take fetch and we're gonna go

23
00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:56.069
to github an grab my github info so,

24
00:00:56.069 --> 00:01:00.236
https://api.github.com/users/wesbos.

25
00:01:03.701 --> 00:01:06.863
That's gonna go ahead and fetch the data that we have there.

26
00:01:06.863 --> 00:01:09.202
Now, if we were to do this, like,

27
00:01:09.202 --> 00:01:12.047
cons response equal to that, and then we were to

28
00:01:12.047 --> 00:01:14.886
console.log that response, what are we gonna get?

29
00:01:14.886 --> 00:01:16.246
Let's take a look.

30
00:01:16.246 --> 00:01:18.831
We get the Promise, so this is not the actual data,

31
00:01:18.831 --> 00:01:20.410
this is just a promise that the data

32
00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:22.296
will come back eventually,

33
00:01:22.296 --> 00:01:26.149
so in order for us to actually transform this Promise

34
00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:28.523
or listen for when the data comes back

35
00:01:28.523 --> 00:01:31.196
we need to attach a dot then not to the end.

36
00:01:31.196 --> 00:01:34.165
So I'm gonna get rid of this console.log here,

37
00:01:34.165 --> 00:01:35.976
get rid of this, and then we're just gonna tack on

38
00:01:35.976 --> 00:01:38.664
a dot then, and that's going to give us a response,

39
00:01:38.664 --> 00:01:40.833
I'm gonna use a little arrow function here,

40
00:01:40.833 --> 00:01:44.566
and we can just console.log the response.

41
00:01:44.566 --> 00:01:47.566
So let's give that a, whoa, console!

42
00:01:50.495 --> 00:01:52.023
So there we go, there's our response,

43
00:01:52.023 --> 00:01:53.573
it comes back fairly quickly but you never know,

44
00:01:53.573 --> 00:01:56.968
sometimes, a API takes a number of seconds to come back,

45
00:01:56.968 --> 00:02:00.468
but I open that up, we have some info but,

46
00:02:01.541 --> 00:02:05.032
headers, body, or if you click these dots,

47
00:02:05.032 --> 00:02:07.177
you get a body, a readable stream,

48
00:02:07.177 --> 00:02:09.605
which is locked: false, I don't know,

49
00:02:09.605 --> 00:02:11.090
like, where is my actual data,

50
00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.829
and that's because fetch does not assume Json,

51
00:02:13.829 --> 00:02:15.928
like a lot of other libraries, like axios,

52
00:02:15.928 --> 00:02:19.084
so it's just a really good Promise based library,

53
00:02:19.084 --> 00:02:23.282
so we need to, again, convert this response into Json.

54
00:02:23.282 --> 00:02:25.528
And the way we can do that is we can just return

55
00:02:25.528 --> 00:02:28.133
the response and call a method called json,

56
00:02:28.133 --> 00:02:30.492
which in turn is going to return a promise,

57
00:02:30.492 --> 00:02:33.302
that means we can chain another, then on the end,

58
00:02:33.302 --> 00:02:35.428
we'll get another response, and then we can

59
00:02:35.428 --> 00:02:39.726
console.log that response and see what we get.

60
00:02:39.726 --> 00:02:43.244
Beauty, so here is a nice object full of all of our data,

61
00:02:43.244 --> 00:02:45.381
the last thing that we need to know is if,

62
00:02:45.381 --> 00:02:47.551
for some reason, I did something wrong, like,

63
00:02:47.551 --> 00:02:50.719
for example, I forgot to put the https on the front,

64
00:02:50.719 --> 00:02:53.478
then, what's gonna happen is, it's gonna break.

65
00:02:53.478 --> 00:02:57.873
And we get an error here, Uncaught (in promise) TypeError

66
00:02:57.873 --> 00:03:00.835
failed to fetch, so, this fetch function

67
00:03:00.835 --> 00:03:03.634
before we even return data to get to this then,

68
00:03:03.634 --> 00:03:06.658
the whole thing broke, because it encountered a url

69
00:03:06.658 --> 00:03:08.972
that doesn't actually exist, right?

70
00:03:08.972 --> 00:03:12.044
It's looking on my hard drive here

71
00:03:12.044 --> 00:03:14.348
locally for that actual thing.

72
00:03:14.348 --> 00:03:16.364
So, that's not exactly what we want,

73
00:03:16.364 --> 00:03:18.620
so the way that we catch that is we have a catch

74
00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:20.348
and then we can take the error,

75
00:03:20.348 --> 00:03:21.929
and then once we have that we can like

76
00:03:21.929 --> 00:03:23.929
console.log like, oh no!

77
00:03:25.413 --> 00:03:28.808
And console.log, the actual error itself,

78
00:03:28.808 --> 00:03:31.857
and you can see that now it actually caught the error,

79
00:03:31.857 --> 00:03:34.834
maybe probably better to do in console.error.

80
00:03:34.834 --> 00:03:37.580
So it gives us some information, oh no, type error,

81
00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:40.149
failed to fetch, and we get a little stack trace

82
00:03:40.149 --> 00:03:42.273
coming along, in terms of, where we had that

83
00:03:42.273 --> 00:03:43.954
and at this point we need to display

84
00:03:43.954 --> 00:03:46.124
some sort of interface to the user,

85
00:03:46.124 --> 00:03:49.461
or try it again, or do something with that actual error,

86
00:03:49.461 --> 00:03:51.141
so that the user knows that,

87
00:03:51.141 --> 00:03:53.132
they're not just sitting around waiting for it.

88
00:03:53.132 --> 00:03:55.254
So, that's fetch, that's the very basics of it,

89
00:03:55.254 --> 00:03:56.587
we are gonna keep that around,

90
00:03:56.587 --> 00:03:58.005
I'm just gonna comment it out,

91
00:03:58.005 --> 00:03:58.994
because we're gonna switch it over

92
00:03:58.994 --> 00:04:00.805
to async/await fairly shortly.

93
00:04:00.805 --> 00:04:02.645
The other one I wanted to show you is the

94
00:04:02.645 --> 00:04:05.333
GetUserMedia, which is your webcam,

95
00:04:05.333 --> 00:04:07.470
it allows us to access the user's webcam,

96
00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:10.303
so I've got a video element right here,

97
00:04:10.303 --> 00:04:11.576
and what we're gonna do is run a

98
00:04:11.576 --> 00:04:15.326
select that video element with QuerySelector.

99
00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:19.525
Then, we're gonna go ahead and ask for the user's webcam,

100
00:04:19.525 --> 00:04:23.108
now if you've taken my JavaScript30 course,

101
00:04:24.072 --> 00:04:27.471
you'll know that, what day is, what date did we do it?

102
00:04:27.471 --> 00:04:31.638
We did it on the webcam fun,

103
00:04:33.885 --> 00:04:37.318
there we go, on day 19th we accessed the user's webcam,

104
00:04:37.318 --> 00:04:39.766
and what's cool about that is that the getUserMedia

105
00:04:39.766 --> 00:04:43.139
also returns a Promise, which will let us

106
00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:45.249
use then and catch for it.

107
00:04:45.249 --> 00:04:48.259
So we take our navigator and we go

108
00:04:48.259 --> 00:04:50.528
to the mediaDevices property

109
00:04:50.528 --> 00:04:52.905
that will have access to all our media devices,

110
00:04:52.905 --> 00:04:55.545
and then we specifically ask for the video stream.

111
00:04:55.545 --> 00:04:59.228
So it's like getUserMedia, and then we'll ask

112
00:04:59.228 --> 00:05:00.464
the video to be true,

113
00:05:00.464 --> 00:05:02.444
you can also ask for audio at that point

114
00:05:02.444 --> 00:05:04.528
but I'm not all that concerned with it.

115
00:05:04.528 --> 00:05:07.785
Then, when the user successfully grants us access

116
00:05:07.785 --> 00:05:10.138
to their webcam, they click that little box that says okay,

117
00:05:10.138 --> 00:05:13.030
we tack a dot, then on the end,

118
00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:15.683
which is going to give us what they call mediaStream,

119
00:05:15.683 --> 00:05:19.350
and let's just console.log that mediaStream.

120
00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:22.787
Let's see what we've got here.

121
00:05:22.787 --> 00:05:26.028
Now, if I refresh this, we're gonna click allow,

122
00:05:26.028 --> 00:05:28.766
and it gives us this raw MediaStream,

123
00:05:28.766 --> 00:05:32.895
which has an id, active, and some information null.

124
00:05:32.895 --> 00:05:35.097
Now what we can do with that MediaStream that we have it,

125
00:05:35.097 --> 00:05:37.139
well, we can just go ahead and take our video element

126
00:05:37.139 --> 00:05:39.164
and we can set this source object

127
00:05:39.164 --> 00:05:42.227
to be equal to the mediaStream,

128
00:05:42.227 --> 00:05:45.500
and that will take the blob of data that's coming off

129
00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:47.535
hot-of-your-webcam, set it right

130
00:05:47.535 --> 00:05:49.564
into your actual video element.

131
00:05:49.564 --> 00:05:52.649
You can also do it with video.src is equal to

132
00:05:52.649 --> 00:05:56.555
window.URL dot something like that...

133
00:05:56.555 --> 00:05:59.885
URL.createObjectURL and then pass it,

134
00:05:59.885 --> 00:06:02.661
the mediaStream, but that comes with some,

135
00:06:02.661 --> 00:06:03.530
it's a little bit different,

136
00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:04.797
that's the older way that we've done it,

137
00:06:04.797 --> 00:06:06.146
that's how I did it at my JavaScript30,

138
00:06:06.146 --> 00:06:10.647
but the new way is just by setting those srcObject directly.

139
00:06:10.647 --> 00:06:12.519
So, let's see what that gets us so far,

140
00:06:12.519 --> 00:06:14.151
I click allow, which will then

141
00:06:14.151 --> 00:06:16.622
trigger the then that we have,

142
00:06:16.622 --> 00:06:19.922
good, and then it's, I see like I got one frame,

143
00:06:19.922 --> 00:06:22.077
oh, there we go, you see like,

144
00:06:22.077 --> 00:06:23.378
it's kind of frozen right now,

145
00:06:23.378 --> 00:06:25.815
but if I move my, I scroll the page

146
00:06:25.815 --> 00:06:28.407
it updates a little bit, apologies,

147
00:06:28.407 --> 00:06:31.633
I'm using the wrong webcam on my computer,

148
00:06:31.633 --> 00:06:34.586
which is overhead, so, how do you work it?

149
00:06:34.586 --> 00:06:37.299
Well, you just say video.load, you load it up,

150
00:06:37.299 --> 00:06:39.939
and then you just call video.play,

151
00:06:39.939 --> 00:06:42.544
which will actually start streaming it from the webcam.

152
00:06:42.544 --> 00:06:46.711
So I click allow, and bam, all of it is coming in.

153
00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:52.224
Hello, you can see me up there, it looks pretty good.

154
00:06:52.224 --> 00:06:56.224
Now, what if I refresh the page and I say block.

155
00:06:57.338 --> 00:06:59.533
We get this Uncaught in promise,

156
00:06:59.533 --> 00:07:01.729
someone said, permission denied.

157
00:07:01.729 --> 00:07:03.719
Oh, okay, well, how do we handle that?

158
00:07:03.719 --> 00:07:06.215
Well, we just type on catch until the end,

159
00:07:06.215 --> 00:07:08.317
which is gonna give us the error,

160
00:07:08.317 --> 00:07:10.765
and then we can just deal with that error however we want.

161
00:07:10.765 --> 00:07:13.584
So let's just console.log, error,

162
00:07:13.584 --> 00:07:15.539
see what the error is giving us,

163
00:07:15.539 --> 00:07:19.008
so refresh, block, here's the error,

164
00:07:19.008 --> 00:07:21.744
and then the name is PermissionDeniedError.

165
00:07:21.744 --> 00:07:26.304
So in this case you could maybe put a little arrow to here,

166
00:07:26.304 --> 00:07:28.461
where the user would be able to click this

167
00:07:28.461 --> 00:07:30.624
and turn things on and off.

168
00:07:30.624 --> 00:07:32.627
Here we go, you can click on this webcam

169
00:07:32.627 --> 00:07:35.782
and you can allow it to access your webcam

170
00:07:35.782 --> 00:07:38.819
or continue to block it, so you would have to post up

171
00:07:38.819 --> 00:07:40.629
some information to the user to say,

172
00:07:40.629 --> 00:07:42.551
hey, things didn't work.

173
00:07:42.551 --> 00:07:44.928
Cool, so, that is two built-in native promises,

174
00:07:44.928 --> 00:07:46.979
in the next video we're going to look at

175
00:07:46.979 --> 00:07:49.488
some custom hand-crafted promises

176
00:07:49.488 --> 00:07:51.562
and then we'll sort of switch it around

177
00:07:51.562 --> 00:07:55.119
and conform both all these things to async/await
