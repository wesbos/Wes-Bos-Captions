00:00:02.912 --> 00:00:04.033
<v Instructor>Now you can clearly see</v>

2
00:00:04.033 --> 00:00:05.981
that by my enthusiasm by ES6 and promises

3
00:00:05.981 --> 00:00:09.385
is that I would love to code absolutely everything in that,

4
00:00:09.385 --> 00:00:11.782
however the reality is that there is still a lot

5
00:00:11.782 --> 00:00:14.400
of Java script either native browser APIs

6
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.324
or existing libraries that you're using

7
00:00:16.324 --> 00:00:18.400
that are all callback based.

8
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.249
Now some really nice libraries are changing

9
00:00:21.249 --> 00:00:22.987
where the both returner promise

10
00:00:22.987 --> 00:00:26.392
as well as still accept a callback for older legacy code.

11
00:00:26.392 --> 00:00:28.778
But if you are in the situation where

12
00:00:28.778 --> 00:00:30.958
you are only in callback

13
00:00:30.958 --> 00:00:32.938
and you want to use promises

14
00:00:32.938 --> 00:00:36.378
I'm going to show you how to promisify an existing function.

15
00:00:36.378 --> 00:00:37.722
Now there's libraries out there

16
00:00:37.722 --> 00:00:38.702
that will do this for you,

17
00:00:38.702 --> 00:00:40.124
but it's actually very simple to be able

18
00:00:40.124 --> 00:00:41.702
to promisify it yourself.

19
00:00:41.702 --> 00:00:43.870
So for my example I'm going to be using

20
00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:47.537
navigator.geolocation to get the coordinates

21
00:00:48.478 --> 00:00:49.820
of where I am right now.

22
00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.022
And that's a bit of an older API

23
00:00:52.022 --> 00:00:54.881
that uses a callback based function.

24
00:00:54.881 --> 00:00:57.058
So here's how we do it right now.

25
00:00:57.058 --> 00:01:01.225
We'll say navigator.geolocation.getcurrentposition

26
00:01:02.064 --> 00:01:05.808
and what happens is that it takes two arguments,

27
00:01:05.808 --> 00:01:08.744
a success function and a error function,

28
00:01:08.744 --> 00:01:10.836
so what we'll do here is we'll say

29
00:01:10.836 --> 00:01:14.503
function and that will give us our position.

30
00:01:16.383 --> 00:01:17.740
And then here we have a function

31
00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.789
which will give us the error.

32
00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:24.956
And then inside of here we can console.log it worked.

33
00:01:26.025 --> 00:01:28.525
And here we can say it failed.

34
00:01:30.381 --> 00:01:34.429
And here we'll console.log the position.

35
00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:37.234
And down here we'll console log the error.

36
00:01:37.234 --> 00:01:39.753
Alright lets take a look at what this all looks like.

37
00:01:39.753 --> 00:01:40.897
So I give this a refresh.

38
00:01:40.897 --> 00:01:43.438
It's gonna ask us can we have your location.

39
00:01:43.438 --> 00:01:46.659
And I click allow and it takes a second or two

40
00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:49.718
depending on how quick the geo location is working.

41
00:01:49.718 --> 00:01:50.551
There we go.

42
00:01:50.551 --> 00:01:51.610
It says it worked.

43
00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:53.349
So the success function ran.

44
00:01:53.349 --> 00:01:56.362
And then it gives us the position and the coordinates

45
00:01:56.362 --> 00:01:58.289
of everything right now.

46
00:01:58.289 --> 00:01:59.410
Now if I were to refresh that

47
00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:03.305
and block it it's immediately going to hit the failed one.

48
00:02:03.305 --> 00:02:05.581
That's great, but that's callback based.

49
00:02:05.581 --> 00:02:08.946
So how can we promisify this into our own function.

50
00:02:08.946 --> 00:02:10.873
So let's comment that out.

51
00:02:10.873 --> 00:02:12.568
So we're going to make a function

52
00:02:12.568 --> 00:02:14.791
called get current position.

53
00:02:14.791 --> 00:02:16.968
And I always like to name them as the same

54
00:02:16.968 --> 00:02:20.115
as the method was, so it shows me that it's the version.

55
00:02:20.115 --> 00:02:22.755
Or some people will write promisified current position.

56
00:02:22.755 --> 00:02:25.087
Whatever you prefer.

57
00:02:25.087 --> 00:02:26.273
And then from that we're going

58
00:02:26.273 --> 00:02:29.279
to return a new promise, right.

59
00:02:29.279 --> 00:02:32.849
And then the promise will have a resolve and a reject.

60
00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:35.656
We'll use an arrow function there.

61
00:02:35.656 --> 00:02:38.078
And then inside of that we just do our work.

62
00:02:38.078 --> 00:02:42.841
So we'll say navigator.geolocation.getcurrentposition.

63
00:02:42.841 --> 00:02:45.192
Now here's the question, what do we pass

64
00:02:45.192 --> 00:02:47.150
for our success function?

65
00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:48.108
Resolve.

66
00:02:48.108 --> 00:02:51.294
What do we pass for our failure function?

67
00:02:51.294 --> 00:02:52.237
Reject.

68
00:02:52.237 --> 00:02:53.304
Right?

69
00:02:53.304 --> 00:02:56.985
So if it is properly done resolve will send

70
00:02:56.985 --> 00:02:58.543
back that position data to us.

71
00:02:58.543 --> 00:03:01.767
And if something happens reject will reject it

72
00:03:01.767 --> 00:03:04.484
and throw an error with whatever error gets passed here.

73
00:03:04.484 --> 00:03:07.102
So that's it and then we can go ahead

74
00:03:07.102 --> 00:03:09.409
and use it so we'll need to make ourselves

75
00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:11.797
an async function called go.

76
00:03:11.797 --> 00:03:15.091
And again the reason being I'm not just doing

77
00:03:15.091 --> 00:03:17.870
this out in the open like I did with this code right here is

78
00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:20.181
because you can not await things out in the open.

79
00:03:20.181 --> 00:03:22.557
You must be inside of an async function.

80
00:03:22.557 --> 00:03:26.553
And let's just run that on page load go.

81
00:03:26.553 --> 00:03:29.548
Then I'll say const position is equal

82
00:03:29.548 --> 00:03:32.048
to await get current position.

83
00:03:35.146 --> 00:03:36.873
And that's it.

84
00:03:36.873 --> 00:03:38.288
We should be able to console.log

85
00:03:38.288 --> 00:03:39.697
the position right after that.

86
00:03:39.697 --> 00:03:41.075
Right, so now there's no callback

87
00:03:41.075 --> 00:03:42.627
we simply use our await keyword

88
00:03:42.627 --> 00:03:44.127
and we click allow

89
00:03:47.265 --> 00:03:49.042
and then after a couple seconds

90
00:03:49.042 --> 00:03:51.109
we should see that data come back, there we go.

91
00:03:51.109 --> 00:03:52.405
Data comes back immediately.

92
00:03:52.405 --> 00:03:53.822
And you can see that this is working

93
00:03:53.822 --> 00:03:57.322
because if up here you were to console log

94
00:03:58.555 --> 00:03:59.388
starting

95
00:04:01.394 --> 00:04:05.061
and down here you were going to say finished

96
00:04:06.015 --> 00:04:07.595
you'll see the starting is done immediately,

97
00:04:07.595 --> 00:04:09.741
now we're awaiting.

98
00:04:09.741 --> 00:04:11.321
And then eventually once it's done, there we go,

99
00:04:11.321 --> 00:04:12.804
then the position comes and then

100
00:04:12.804 --> 00:04:16.437
the finished console log actually runs itself.

101
00:04:16.437 --> 00:04:17.980
Last thing I want to do is get current position

102
00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:19.722
actually takes some arguments.

103
00:04:19.722 --> 00:04:23.085
Sometimes you can set things like how accurate

104
00:04:23.085 --> 00:04:24.812
you want to be depending on how much battery life

105
00:04:24.812 --> 00:04:27.498
the person has and what not.

106
00:04:27.498 --> 00:04:30.130
So in our case we'll use a rest to capture

107
00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:32.383
all those arguments and then we'll

108
00:04:32.383 --> 00:04:35.487
use a spread to pass in spread into those arguments

109
00:04:35.487 --> 00:04:38.863
before resolve and reject that gets passed in there.

110
00:04:38.863 --> 00:04:40.861
And now if I refresh it, allow it,

111
00:04:40.861 --> 00:04:43.671
it still works just as we want,

112
00:04:43.671 --> 00:04:45.331
but if some were to pass us with

113
00:04:45.331 --> 00:04:47.084
an options object inside of there

114
00:04:47.084 --> 00:04:50.162
those would get passed along no problem.

115
00:04:50.162 --> 00:04:52.808
So that's promisifying without any sort of library.

116
00:04:52.808 --> 00:04:56.615
If you do want to library you can check out ES6-promisify,

117
00:04:56.615 --> 00:04:59.059
or if you're using Node there's even

118
00:04:59.059 --> 00:05:01.640
a built in utility in the util package

119
00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:03.727
that comes baked right in with Node.
