<v Wes>Error handling for async/await</v>

3
00:00:04.061 --> 00:00:05.347
is actually very simple,

4
00:00:05.347 --> 00:00:07.560
although it doesn't look as nice in your code,

5
00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.142
which leads some people to not be all that excited about it.

6
00:00:11.142 --> 00:00:13.323
So, the way that it works is you simply just take

7
00:00:13.323 --> 00:00:15.660
all or one of your Await functions,

8
00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.676
anything that needs to be awaited,

9
00:00:17.676 --> 00:00:20.451
and you wrap the entire thing in a try-catch block.

10
00:00:20.451 --> 00:00:22.697
So essentially, we say try,

11
00:00:22.697 --> 00:00:24.364
do all of this code,

12
00:00:27.723 --> 00:00:29.918
and if anything happens,

13
00:00:29.918 --> 00:00:30.751
don't worry.

14
00:00:30.751 --> 00:00:32.581
We're sort of like sandboxed in the confines

15
00:00:32.581 --> 00:00:34.435
of these curly brackets here.

16
00:00:34.435 --> 00:00:36.685
So we will catch the error.

17
00:00:38.091 --> 00:00:38.953
And then in here,

18
00:00:38.953 --> 00:00:43.120
we can just do console.error('Ohhhh nooo!!!'),

19
00:00:44.381 --> 00:00:48.464
and console.error, the actual error that we have.

20
00:00:50.088 --> 00:00:50.921
So there we go.

21
00:00:50.921 --> 00:00:52.306
Start, Ohhhh nooo!!!

22
00:00:52.306 --> 00:00:53.618
That value was too small.

23
00:00:53.618 --> 00:00:54.451
And then at that point,

24
00:00:54.451 --> 00:00:57.575
we'd be able to show our user our actual values.

25
00:00:57.575 --> 00:00:59.968
There is a bit more of a complicated way

26
00:00:59.968 --> 00:01:00.981
that we can do it

27
00:01:00.981 --> 00:01:03.517
by using something called a high-order function.

28
00:01:03.517 --> 00:01:04.778
So let me just explain to you

29
00:01:04.778 --> 00:01:08.126
where I stumbled upon this more advanced function,

30
00:01:08.126 --> 00:01:09.260
and it was in my Node course.

31
00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.167
So in my Node course, we do things often

32
00:01:11.167 --> 00:01:14.784
where we put our routes into variables.

33
00:01:14.784 --> 00:01:18.546
So we'll say like const userPage =, and then we'll have

34
00:01:18.546 --> 00:01:23.369
our router.get, and when somebody visits the userPage,

35
00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.536
we're going to run a function that has a request object

36
00:01:28.593 --> 00:01:30.374
with information about the data coming in.

37
00:01:30.374 --> 00:01:31.597
We have a response object,

38
00:01:31.597 --> 00:01:34.585
which is the information going back to the browser

39
00:01:34.585 --> 00:01:37.029
or to the actual thing that requested it,

40
00:01:37.029 --> 00:01:38.906
and then we have a function called next,

41
00:01:38.906 --> 00:01:43.491
which will allow us to skip on over to the next route

42
00:01:43.491 --> 00:01:44.324
that is in the thing,

43
00:01:44.324 --> 00:01:47.504
or eventually it will trickle down into our error page.

44
00:01:47.504 --> 00:01:48.854
Now, that was really handy,

45
00:01:48.854 --> 00:01:52.252
because what we needed to do is do a database lookup

46
00:01:52.252 --> 00:01:55.355
where we'd see something like const users =,

47
00:01:55.355 --> 00:01:58.337
we'll take our user model, and we would like find them all,

48
00:01:58.337 --> 00:02:01.545
or find them all where the email is equal to wesbos,

49
00:02:01.545 --> 00:02:02.684
or something like that, right?

50
00:02:02.684 --> 00:02:05.004
So, let's say for example this would return,

51
00:02:05.004 --> 00:02:06.939
like, 10 users.

52
00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:10.500
The problem here is that this User.find was promisified.

53
00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:11.333
So that's pretty simple.

54
00:02:11.333 --> 00:02:13.143
We can just type await in front of it

55
00:02:13.143 --> 00:02:16.352
and then make this callback function here async.

56
00:02:16.352 --> 00:02:19.444
And then we would wait for the database to come back

57
00:02:19.444 --> 00:02:20.745
with all of its information

58
00:02:20.745 --> 00:02:22.486
and put it into our users variable.

59
00:02:22.486 --> 00:02:25.204
That is a perfect user of async/await,

60
00:02:25.204 --> 00:02:26.506
because there's no callbacks.

61
00:02:26.506 --> 00:02:29.922
There are multilevels of functions using there.

62
00:02:29.922 --> 00:02:33.561
The downside is that if anything were to ever go awry

63
00:02:33.561 --> 00:02:35.395
with our database lookup,

64
00:02:35.395 --> 00:02:37.408
where maybe the database is connected,

65
00:02:37.408 --> 00:02:39.130
or we had a syntax error,

66
00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.599
or anything that were to go wrong here,

67
00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:42.432
the whole thing would break,

68
00:02:42.432 --> 00:02:44.139
and eventually what's gonna happen

69
00:02:44.139 --> 00:02:46.317
is your node process is just gonna exit.

70
00:02:46.317 --> 00:02:50.484
So you do need to wrap this entire thing in a try,

71
00:02:52.417 --> 00:02:55.602
and then you would catch the actual error,

72
00:02:55.602 --> 00:02:56.435
and then in here,

73
00:02:56.435 --> 00:03:00.451
you would say res.render out the error page.

74
00:03:00.451 --> 00:03:03.724
But the thing here is that this error page,

75
00:03:03.724 --> 00:03:06.026
we would need to do this for every single route.

76
00:03:06.026 --> 00:03:08.586
And if you have 30, 40 pages on your website,

77
00:03:08.586 --> 00:03:10.621
try-catching and rendering out the error page

78
00:03:10.621 --> 00:03:14.223
for every single one is not exactly ideal.

79
00:03:14.223 --> 00:03:16.048
So, what we can do is actually use a concept

80
00:03:16.048 --> 00:03:17.803
called a high-order function,

81
00:03:17.803 --> 00:03:18.636
which will allow us

82
00:03:18.636 --> 00:03:22.413
to sort of wrap this userPage function that we made here

83
00:03:22.413 --> 00:03:25.263
in another function that will act

84
00:03:25.263 --> 00:03:27.091
as sort of a catch-all for all of 'em.

85
00:03:27.091 --> 00:03:29.929
So, let's take a look at how that works right now.

86
00:03:29.929 --> 00:03:31.402
So, obviously, we don't need this code here.

87
00:03:31.402 --> 00:03:32.325
That was just an example.

88
00:03:32.325 --> 00:03:33.400
So go ahead and delete it.

89
00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.197
And then I also you want you to delete the catch

90
00:03:36.197 --> 00:03:38.227
along with the console.errors

91
00:03:38.227 --> 00:03:41.035
and the try in our sync function.

92
00:03:41.035 --> 00:03:42.867
So we are just running an async function

93
00:03:42.867 --> 00:03:46.167
with await inside of it, no try-catch to save us

94
00:03:46.167 --> 00:03:47.895
for when this actually errors.

95
00:03:47.895 --> 00:03:48.803
And let's just double-check

96
00:03:48.803 --> 00:03:50.824
that we're gonna get our uncaught in Promise.

97
00:03:50.824 --> 00:03:51.657
Good.

98
00:03:51.657 --> 00:03:53.193
Then what we can do is we can make

99
00:03:53.193 --> 00:03:55.554
what's called a high-order function

100
00:03:55.554 --> 00:03:58.107
that's going to wrap this function ourselves.

101
00:03:58.107 --> 00:04:01.637
And you can do some more research into what this is,

102
00:04:01.637 --> 00:04:03.378
but essentially what a high-order function is

103
00:04:03.378 --> 00:04:06.545
is a function that takes in a function

104
00:04:07.795 --> 00:04:12.586
as an argument and returns a new function to yourself.

105
00:04:12.586 --> 00:04:15.730
So, it's sort of like a little function factory

106
00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:17.183
that takes in a function,

107
00:04:17.183 --> 00:04:20.077
adds a little bit of its own sparkle on top,

108
00:04:20.077 --> 00:04:23.100
and then returns to you a brand-new function.

109
00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:25.007
So let's go right here,

110
00:04:25.007 --> 00:04:26.946
and we're going to make a function

111
00:04:26.946 --> 00:04:28.529
called catchErrors,

112
00:04:29.421 --> 00:04:31.560
and that is going to take in a function,

113
00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:32.766
we'll call it fn.

114
00:04:32.766 --> 00:04:33.599
Now from that,

115
00:04:33.599 --> 00:04:35.409
we're actually going to be returning a function.

116
00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:36.699
But let me stop real quick.

117
00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:38.589
This fn that's getting passed in,

118
00:04:38.589 --> 00:04:40.016
that's gonna be any function.

119
00:04:40.016 --> 00:04:44.244
You know when I have like an array of items,

120
00:04:44.244 --> 00:04:45.933
and you call .map,

121
00:04:45.933 --> 00:04:48.255
and what is the argument that you give to map?

122
00:04:48.255 --> 00:04:50.576
Well, you give it a function,

123
00:04:50.576 --> 00:04:52.246
or maybe you have like a little arrow function.

124
00:04:52.246 --> 00:04:54.475
Whether it's an arrow function or a regular function,

125
00:04:54.475 --> 00:04:56.792
it doesn't matter, but that is to say

126
00:04:56.792 --> 00:05:01.440
that the argument for map is in itself a function.

127
00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:03.671
And often, people are very comfortable using these map

128
00:05:03.671 --> 00:05:06.312
things no problem and passing the argument to a function,

129
00:05:06.312 --> 00:05:08.650
but when you're on the other side

130
00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:11.112
actually creating a function that takes in a function

131
00:05:11.112 --> 00:05:14.094
as an argument, it can get a little bit wishy-washy.

132
00:05:14.094 --> 00:05:15.151
So stick with me here.

133
00:05:15.151 --> 00:05:16.010
Don't worry if this doesn't

134
00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:18.315
totally make sense right off the bat.

135
00:05:18.315 --> 00:05:22.236
It will definitely comes to you after a couple go's over it.

136
00:05:22.236 --> 00:05:23.636
So, we're taking in a function,

137
00:05:23.636 --> 00:05:27.243
and then we're going to immediately just return

138
00:05:27.243 --> 00:05:28.493
a new function,

139
00:05:30.018 --> 00:05:35.006
and let's just like, console.log the actual function

140
00:05:35.006 --> 00:05:35.839
that came in.

141
00:05:35.839 --> 00:05:38.064
So, and then the way that this is going to work

142
00:05:38.064 --> 00:05:40.891
is we're not going to run go directly right here.

143
00:05:40.891 --> 00:05:43.244
What we're going to do is make a wrapped function.

144
00:05:43.244 --> 00:05:47.411
So let's say const wrappedFunction = catchErrors,

145
00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:50.213
and then we're gonna pass it

146
00:05:50.213 --> 00:05:51.981
the name of the function that we wanna run.

147
00:05:51.981 --> 00:05:53.225
So, go.

148
00:05:53.225 --> 00:05:55.900
Now we have this new function called wrappedFunction.

149
00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:57.190
Let me show you.

150
00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:58.318
Nothing is there,

151
00:05:58.318 --> 00:06:01.401
but if I looked at my wrappedFunction

152
00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:04.044
here, you'll see that this

153
00:06:04.044 --> 00:06:06.469
is just a function that console logs it.

154
00:06:06.469 --> 00:06:08.732
It's a pretty standard little function.

155
00:06:08.732 --> 00:06:11.490
But if I were to run that,

156
00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:14.571
then we still don't run our same function,

157
00:06:14.571 --> 00:06:17.014
but we actually see that the function

158
00:06:17.014 --> 00:06:19.136
is then being passed in.

159
00:06:19.136 --> 00:06:22.129
Now, here is where the magic comes in.

160
00:06:22.129 --> 00:06:24.880
From that, we are going to return

161
00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:27.866
the actual function itself, but we're gonna run it.

162
00:06:27.866 --> 00:06:32.245
So again, at this point, fn is really our go function.

163
00:06:32.245 --> 00:06:33.641
So we're kind of returning go,

164
00:06:33.641 --> 00:06:35.574
but we're making this nice and flexible

165
00:06:35.574 --> 00:06:37.519
so you can pass in any function.

166
00:06:37.519 --> 00:06:41.725
And then we're going to tack on the .catch onto the end,

167
00:06:41.725 --> 00:06:45.182
because this is Promise's after all,

168
00:06:45.182 --> 00:06:48.422
so you can always just tack on a .catch on the end

169
00:06:48.422 --> 00:06:52.261
and then inside of there, you could either pass that off

170
00:06:52.261 --> 00:06:55.365
to an external, like, handleErrors function,

171
00:06:55.365 --> 00:06:57.500
or you could handle the error right then and there.

172
00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:58.718
So let's just do that real quick.

173
00:06:58.718 --> 00:07:01.023
We get the error, and then let's just

174
00:07:01.023 --> 00:07:05.190
console.error('Ohhhh nooo!!!!!'),

175
00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:10.487
and console.error the actual error.

176
00:07:12.598 --> 00:07:15.361
So we have a function that returns a function

177
00:07:15.361 --> 00:07:18.111
that returns a function that runs

178
00:07:19.146 --> 00:07:20.832
but with a catch on the end.

179
00:07:20.832 --> 00:07:23.261
So all this function is doing is running it

180
00:07:23.261 --> 00:07:26.518
and tacking on a catch to catch any errors that we have.

181
00:07:26.518 --> 00:07:28.964
Now we have this wrappedFunction down here,

182
00:07:28.964 --> 00:07:31.496
and if we were to run that wrappedFunction

183
00:07:31.496 --> 00:07:33.019
at the end of the day, we're running go.

184
00:07:33.019 --> 00:07:37.179
We're sort of like taking go, wrapping it in catchErrors,

185
00:07:37.179 --> 00:07:40.540
sprinkling a little bit of extra something something on top

186
00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:41.460
with catchErrors,

187
00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:45.422
and then that gives us a brand-new wrappedFunction function.

188
00:07:45.422 --> 00:07:47.834
So now, when we refresh, there we go.

189
00:07:47.834 --> 00:07:50.478
We hit our first error, which is under 500,

190
00:07:50.478 --> 00:07:52.123
and then we get our Ohhhh nooo!!!!!

191
00:07:52.123 --> 00:07:54.060
That is too small of a value,

192
00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:56.167
because we've wrapped it in this value.

193
00:07:56.167 --> 00:07:58.912
So one other question I get fairly often

194
00:07:58.912 --> 00:08:02.682
is like, that's great, but what if my go function

195
00:08:02.682 --> 00:08:05.341
took an argument, like name,

196
00:08:05.341 --> 00:08:08.216
and then we were gonna like, maybe like,

197
00:08:08.216 --> 00:08:11.870
starting for, and we'll put the person's name,

198
00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:13.787
right, inside of there?

199
00:08:14.754 --> 00:08:16.267
Well, how does that work?

200
00:08:16.267 --> 00:08:20.538
Well, again, you can just pass wrappedFunction('Wes'),

201
00:08:20.538 --> 00:08:23.179
and when we rerun this, it's not gonna work, but watch.

202
00:08:23.179 --> 00:08:25.178
Starting for undefined,

203
00:08:25.178 --> 00:08:28.966
so, how does, how do we get the arguments

204
00:08:28.966 --> 00:08:31.522
to pass themselves through?

205
00:08:31.522 --> 00:08:35.118
Well, what we can do is we can take name in here

206
00:08:35.118 --> 00:08:36.859
and then pass the name here.

207
00:08:36.859 --> 00:08:38.605
That'll work, right?

208
00:08:38.605 --> 00:08:39.873
STarting for Wes!!!
It works good,

209
00:08:39.873 --> 00:08:42.137
but like, that's not very flexible,

210
00:08:42.137 --> 00:08:46.615
because how do we know how many arguments are coming

211
00:08:46.615 --> 00:08:49.458
and what the names of the arguments and parameters are?

212
00:08:49.458 --> 00:08:50.291
So what we can do,

213
00:08:50.291 --> 00:08:54.291
look back to our ES6 rest and spread parameters,

214
00:08:55.479 --> 00:08:58.396
is we can use a rest here, ...args,

215
00:09:00.783 --> 00:09:04.237
to capture all the arguments into an array,

216
00:09:04.237 --> 00:09:08.449
and then we can use our spread ...args to spread

217
00:09:08.449 --> 00:09:12.137
all those arguments immediately back into that function.

218
00:09:12.137 --> 00:09:14.515
So give it a save, refresh.

219
00:09:14.515 --> 00:09:15.544
STarting for Wes!!!

220
00:09:15.544 --> 00:09:16.945
Good, it works no problem,

221
00:09:16.945 --> 00:09:20.730
and if I were to add like a, like a last name variable

222
00:09:20.730 --> 00:09:23.791
where we were to put the person's last name in there

223
00:09:23.791 --> 00:09:26.874
as well, and I were to pass Bos here,

224
00:09:27.898 --> 00:09:28.856
it should just work

225
00:09:28.856 --> 00:09:32.895
without having to modify our catchErrors function.

226
00:09:32.895 --> 00:09:35.159
Beautiful, STarting for Wes Bos!!!

227
00:09:35.159 --> 00:09:37.142
So, give that a couple times over.

228
00:09:37.142 --> 00:09:40.889
Maybe give it a bit of a read through a few times.

229
00:09:40.889 --> 00:09:45.007
But this catchErrors is going to be really handy.

230
00:09:45.007 --> 00:09:48.230
That said, it shouldn't be used absolutely all the time,

231
00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:51.515
because in many cases, you do wanna catch the error

232
00:09:51.515 --> 00:09:52.835
right inside of your function

233
00:09:52.835 --> 00:09:55.263
because you specifically know how to handle it.

234
00:09:55.263 --> 00:09:57.924
If you are catching a form validation error,

235
00:09:57.924 --> 00:09:59.797
you'll wanna handle that differently

236
00:09:59.797 --> 00:10:02.827
than when you're encountering any type

237
00:10:02.827 --> 00:10:05.128
of like a timer error or any other error

238
00:10:05.128 --> 00:10:07.202
that's going to encounter on your website.

239
00:10:07.202 --> 00:10:10.834
So, this is great for a use case where you're handling

240
00:10:10.834 --> 00:10:12.940
all the errors in a similar way

241
00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:15.237
and you don't wanna have to write a try-catch

242
00:10:15.237 --> 00:10:16.984
for every single one,

243
00:10:16.984 --> 00:10:19.404
exactly how we've done it in the Learn Node.

244
00:10:19.404 --> 00:10:21.128
We've got lots of different URLs,

245
00:10:21.128 --> 00:10:23.394
and if any URL breaks,

246
00:10:23.394 --> 00:10:26.118
then we immediately will do the exact same thing

247
00:10:26.118 --> 00:10:26.951
for each of 'em.

248
00:10:26.951 --> 00:10:28.721
We will render out the error page

249
00:10:28.721 --> 00:10:30.327
and show them the actual error.

250
00:10:30.327 --> 00:10:32.576
However, in some other use cases,

251
00:10:32.576 --> 00:10:34.267
we wanna have a custom error.

252
00:10:34.267 --> 00:10:35.716
And if that's the case,

253
00:10:35.716 --> 00:10:38.038
then we will catch it ourselves

254
00:10:38.038 --> 00:10:39.334
and deal with it directly.

255
00:10:39.334 --> 00:10:41.283
So, hopefully that helps you a little bit.

256
00:10:41.283 --> 00:10:42.739
I know this stuff's a little bit hairy,

257
00:10:42.739 --> 00:10:45.103
but I'll see you in the next video.
