00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:04.657
<v Instructor>Alright, let's do a quick review</v>

3
00:00:04.657 --> 00:00:05.939
of custom promises.

4
00:00:05.939 --> 00:00:09.880
Any function that returns a promise has a promise-based API

5
00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:12.621
and can be used interchangeably with either

6
00:00:12.621 --> 00:00:14.696
then then then catch or the async await,

7
00:00:14.696 --> 00:00:16.256
which we're gonna learn about in a second.

8
00:00:16.256 --> 00:00:19.022
So, let's take an example of a function where you want to

9
00:00:19.022 --> 00:00:22.142
maybe, like, sleep or breathe or wait for a couple seconds.

10
00:00:22.142 --> 00:00:24.744
It's not a function that's gonna execute and run

11
00:00:24.744 --> 00:00:27.342
immediately, we sort of, like, want to make a breathe

12
00:00:27.342 --> 00:00:29.800
function that waits for four sections, and then after

13
00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.400
that four seconds is finished, we will then do whatever

14
00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.682
the next task at hand is.

15
00:00:35.682 --> 00:00:37.719
So, previously, the way that worked is, we would have,

16
00:00:37.719 --> 00:00:41.303
like, a breathe function, we would breathe for a second,

17
00:00:41.303 --> 00:00:43.522
and then, when that's over, we would have a function

18
00:00:43.522 --> 00:00:46.024
that's a callback, and then if we wanted a breathe

19
00:00:46.024 --> 00:00:48.894
inside of that, well, we would just copy that

20
00:00:48.894 --> 00:00:52.184
and then breathe inside there, and maybe that one

21
00:00:52.184 --> 00:00:54.744
would be, like, two seconds, and you get the point, right?

22
00:00:54.744 --> 00:00:57.144
All of a sudden, we start getting, like, I could just start

23
00:00:57.144 --> 00:00:59.943
pasting them in, paste them in, I might pretty

24
00:00:59.943 --> 00:01:04.274
or clean it up, what we're writing is callback hell.

25
00:01:04.274 --> 00:01:06.236
We don't want to be doing that, we want to be writing it

26
00:01:06.236 --> 00:01:09.079
as sort of, like, flat as possible.

27
00:01:09.079 --> 00:01:11.255
So, a really nice solution to that is allow your function

28
00:01:11.255 --> 00:01:14.156
to return a promise, so we're gonna make a function called

29
00:01:14.156 --> 00:01:17.559
breathe, and that's going to take an amount

30
00:01:17.559 --> 00:01:21.255
that we should breathe, and from that, we're just going to

31
00:01:21.255 --> 00:01:25.422
immediately return a new promise, and that promise

32
00:01:26.898 --> 00:01:30.656
takes the function as well, so we're going to have a resolve

33
00:01:30.656 --> 00:01:33.735
function for when the promise is successfully done,

34
00:01:33.735 --> 00:01:36.674
and we have a reject function for when anything goes wrong

35
00:01:36.674 --> 00:01:38.775
inside of this promise and we need to abort

36
00:01:38.775 --> 00:01:41.319
or bail on the function together.

37
00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:43.450
So, good, we've got that up and running here.

38
00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.807
Now what we're going to do is just wait for the amount

39
00:01:45.807 --> 00:01:49.109
of time that they want to breathe before we resolve.

40
00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:51.647
So we'll use a setTimeout for that, and we are going

41
00:01:51.647 --> 00:01:54.010
to just run a little in-line arrow function

42
00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:56.970
where we will resolve and say done.

43
00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:00.010
And when you resolve a function, you sometimes want

44
00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:03.685
to pass back a value to the actual user, so actually,

45
00:02:03.685 --> 00:02:06.906
maybe we should interpolate the extra value that we have,

46
00:02:06.906 --> 00:02:10.739
so, done for amount milliseconds.

47
00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:17.245
Good, and then we also want to run that after the amount.

48
00:02:17.245 --> 00:02:20.010
So this is just a little timer that will wait however long,

49
00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.380
then we pass it, and then console log done for that amount.

50
00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.577
So let's go ahead and try to use this.

51
00:02:26.577 --> 00:02:29.537
We'll say breathe, we want to breathe for maybe a second,

52
00:02:29.537 --> 00:02:33.238
and then, when that is finished, we are going to get

53
00:02:33.238 --> 00:02:36.678
the response that comes back, and let's just console.log

54
00:02:36.678 --> 00:02:39.958
the response to see what that looks like.

55
00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:43.521
So, open this up, I'll refresh, and after a second,

56
00:02:43.521 --> 00:02:45.718
we get done for a hundred milliseconds.

57
00:02:45.718 --> 00:02:48.460
Now, what if we wanted to do four or five of those,

58
00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:49.777
one after another?

59
00:02:49.777 --> 00:02:52.417
Well, what we can do here is we can just return another

60
00:02:52.417 --> 00:02:56.584
breathe function, which will go for maybe 500 milliseconds.

61
00:02:59.297 --> 00:03:02.718
And we'll chain a .then onto that.

62
00:03:02.718 --> 00:03:04.198
There was a response.

63
00:03:04.198 --> 00:03:05.201
You get the point, right?

64
00:03:05.201 --> 00:03:08.004
We can console log here and see what what we got.

65
00:03:08.004 --> 00:03:12.544
So, one second, half a second later, we've got those values.

66
00:03:12.544 --> 00:03:14.230
Let's just go nuts a little bit here.

67
00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:17.366
You can just copy/paste these, chain them on as far

68
00:03:17.366 --> 00:03:19.551
as we want, and then just change the values

69
00:03:19.551 --> 00:03:21.727
for however many we want.

70
00:03:21.727 --> 00:03:26.384
That's not what I want, we want a return, a breathe of

71
00:03:26.384 --> 00:03:29.227
maybe 600 milliseconds, and then we can just chain these on

72
00:03:29.227 --> 00:03:32.310
for as long as we could possibly want.

73
00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:36.477
So here, 500, 600, 200, 500,

74
00:03:38.027 --> 00:03:42.194
2000, 250, 300, 600, good.

75
00:03:44.326 --> 00:03:46.826
So let's see what we got here.

76
00:03:50.923 --> 00:03:53.526
There, we've nicely chained these along with a fairly

77
00:03:53.526 --> 00:03:56.624
good-looking API, which is our then then then then.

78
00:03:56.624 --> 00:03:58.464
Well, what about this reject here?

79
00:03:58.464 --> 00:04:01.946
We've only resolved, and in a perfect world, your functions

80
00:04:01.946 --> 00:04:04.144
will always work out perfectly, but what if something

81
00:04:04.144 --> 00:04:05.344
were to go wrong?

82
00:04:05.344 --> 00:04:08.667
So, let's say, for example, you should pass

83
00:04:08.667 --> 00:04:11.488
at a minimum, 500 milliseconds, anything under

84
00:04:11.488 --> 00:04:14.905
500 milliseconds is going to be an error.

85
00:04:15.894 --> 00:04:18.443
So what we can do here is we can say if the amount

86
00:04:18.443 --> 00:04:22.610
is less than 500, we can reject, and the way that would

87
00:04:23.648 --> 00:04:27.315
reject is say, that is too small of a value.

88
00:04:30.646 --> 00:04:33.664
Now when we run this thing, we get one second,

89
00:04:33.664 --> 00:04:36.944
500 milliseconds, 600, and then, bzz, we get an error here.

90
00:04:36.944 --> 00:04:39.883
Uncaught in promise, that is too small a value, right?

91
00:04:39.883 --> 00:04:43.104
So the error got thrown, but we didn't actually catch it,

92
00:04:43.104 --> 00:04:45.227
we didn't do anything with it, and ideally,

93
00:04:45.227 --> 00:04:48.683
we would show that to the user as some sort of mistake.

94
00:04:48.683 --> 00:04:51.951
So what we can do is, if anywhere along these then then

95
00:04:51.951 --> 00:04:54.902
then then then then thens, something that goes wrong,

96
00:04:54.902 --> 00:04:58.683
we tack a .catch onto the end, which'll give us our error,

97
00:04:58.683 --> 00:05:02.960
and we can just say console.error, which is the err,

98
00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:06.710
and maybe just console error, you screwed up.

99
00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:11.093
You scwrewed up!

100
00:05:12.043 --> 00:05:13.460
Dwight Schrute.

101
00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:15.217
Alright, here we go, you scwrewed up.

102
00:05:15.217 --> 00:05:16.643
That's too small a value, good.

103
00:05:16.643 --> 00:05:18.204
So we've actually caught the error.

104
00:05:18.204 --> 00:05:21.349
So that's the basics of promises.

105
00:05:21.349 --> 00:05:24.088
If you want more experience with that, go back to all

106
00:05:24.088 --> 00:05:26.508
the videos that we have on promises, but what we're gonna do

107
00:05:26.508 --> 00:05:29.308
now is dive into how can we make this look a little bit

108
00:05:29.308 --> 00:05:32.725
better with something called async await.
