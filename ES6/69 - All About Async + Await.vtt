00:00:02.968 --> 00:00:04.637
<v Wes>Real quick before we dive into async/await</v>

2
00:00:04.637 --> 00:00:07.195
let's just talk about what do those words even mean?

3
00:00:07.195 --> 00:00:09.126
Asynchronous and synchronous,

4
00:00:09.126 --> 00:00:12.595
you hear them thrown around a lot in JavaScript land,

5
00:00:12.595 --> 00:00:14.985
but let's take a quick look at what that actually means.

6
00:00:14.985 --> 00:00:17.275
So when you execute something synchronously

7
00:00:17.275 --> 00:00:20.734
you wait for the task to be done

8
00:00:20.734 --> 00:00:24.243
before you continue on with the rest of your actual code.

9
00:00:24.243 --> 00:00:26.235
Where has when you do something asynchronously,

10
00:00:26.235 --> 00:00:27.475
you start the task

11
00:00:27.475 --> 00:00:30.913
but then you immediately move on to the next actual value.

12
00:00:30.913 --> 00:00:32.825
That's why we can't do something like this

13
00:00:32.825 --> 00:00:36.270
where we previously had say const response

14
00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.482
is equal to fetch

15
00:00:38.482 --> 00:00:43.214
and then fetched something from like https://github.com

16
00:00:43.214 --> 00:00:44.491
and then the next line

17
00:00:44.491 --> 00:00:48.491
immediately we try to console.log that response.

18
00:00:49.553 --> 00:00:52.673
The reason why response is gonna be equal to a promise

19
00:00:52.673 --> 00:00:55.171
and not the actual value is that

20
00:00:55.171 --> 00:00:58.073
most things in JavaScript do not wait for anyone

21
00:00:58.073 --> 00:01:00.763
meaning that they will execute the fetch,

22
00:01:00.763 --> 00:01:02.582
however, they're not going to sit around

23
00:01:02.582 --> 00:01:04.283
and pause all of JavaScript

24
00:01:04.283 --> 00:01:07.793
and just wait until it comes back.

25
00:01:07.793 --> 00:01:09.751
That's what's called blocking in JavaScript

26
00:01:09.751 --> 00:01:12.211
where you block the rest of JavaScript from running

27
00:01:12.211 --> 00:01:14.437
while you wait on this one single thing.

28
00:01:14.437 --> 00:01:16.590
A good example of something that is blocking

29
00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.064
is actually alert.

30
00:01:18.064 --> 00:01:20.276
If we were to just start by

31
00:01:20.276 --> 00:01:22.193
let's do a set interval

32
00:01:24.894 --> 00:01:27.311
let's do something like every

33
00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.024
one second or every 500 milliseconds

34
00:01:31.024 --> 00:01:33.385
will run console.log date.now.

35
00:01:33.385 --> 00:01:34.684
So let's see what we got here.

36
00:01:34.684 --> 00:01:35.517
Good.

37
00:01:35.517 --> 00:01:38.950
Now we're logging the current number of milliseconds,

38
00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:40.492
every 500 milliseconds

39
00:01:40.492 --> 00:01:43.081
but if I were to run alert("hi")

40
00:01:43.081 --> 00:01:44.923
in the middle of this.

41
00:01:44.923 --> 00:01:48.987
You notice how the console logging of date.now just stops?

42
00:01:48.987 --> 00:01:51.739
That's because the alert is blocking

43
00:01:51.739 --> 00:01:53.827
and is not letting anything else go on

44
00:01:53.827 --> 00:01:55.529
and alert, in prompt, and confirm

45
00:01:55.529 --> 00:01:57.178
they're some of the very few things

46
00:01:57.178 --> 00:01:59.241
that actually do do that in JavaScript

47
00:01:59.241 --> 00:02:01.717
and almost absolutely everything else in JavaScript

48
00:02:01.717 --> 00:02:03.445
is asynchronous meaning that

49
00:02:03.445 --> 00:02:05.109
you can launch something up

50
00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:09.276
like for example if I were to try console.log hello.

51
00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:11.517
It's just going to interpolate that

52
00:02:11.517 --> 00:02:14.877
hello well this other stuff keeps on running

53
00:02:14.877 --> 00:02:18.472
not a big deal for that to actually happen.

54
00:02:18.472 --> 00:02:20.687
That is great but it becomes a problem

55
00:02:20.687 --> 00:02:22.384
when we want flow control.

56
00:02:22.384 --> 00:02:23.887
When we want one thing to happen

57
00:02:23.887 --> 00:02:25.675
and then we wanna deal with the response

58
00:02:25.675 --> 00:02:27.938
and then we wanna deal with the second response, right?

59
00:02:27.938 --> 00:02:30.766
Just like we did with our native promises

60
00:02:30.766 --> 00:02:32.105
where we first needed to wait

61
00:02:32.105 --> 00:02:34.237
until we got access to the webcam

62
00:02:34.237 --> 00:02:36.339
and then we wanted to set it to the actually

63
00:02:36.339 --> 00:02:38.192
media and media stream.

64
00:02:38.192 --> 00:02:41.163
Same thing when we did with our custom promises

65
00:02:41.163 --> 00:02:42.723
review that we had here.

66
00:02:42.723 --> 00:02:44.901
We ended up with this okay API

67
00:02:44.901 --> 00:02:47.868
which is chaining then, then, then, then, then

68
00:02:47.868 --> 00:02:49.339
one after another,

69
00:02:49.339 --> 00:02:51.715
but we still don't have the ability

70
00:02:51.715 --> 00:02:53.717
to do something like this.

71
00:02:53.717 --> 00:02:55.517
Where I could just run

72
00:02:55.517 --> 00:02:58.478
breathe, breathe, breathe, breathe, breathe, breathe

73
00:02:58.478 --> 00:03:01.144
and after every single one

74
00:03:01.144 --> 00:03:03.208
you would wait a second then run the next line,

75
00:03:03.208 --> 00:03:05.795
wait a second then run the next line, wait a second

76
00:03:05.795 --> 00:03:07.928
or wait for another ajax request

77
00:03:07.928 --> 00:03:09.544
and then run the second ajax request.

78
00:03:09.544 --> 00:03:10.976
You get the point right?

79
00:03:10.976 --> 00:03:13.291
We need a way to essentially

80
00:03:13.291 --> 00:03:15.134
not really pause JavaScript,

81
00:03:15.134 --> 00:03:16.915
but just wait for a second

82
00:03:16.915 --> 00:03:19.443
while the current line finishes executing

83
00:03:19.443 --> 00:03:22.307
without having the downside of the alert

84
00:03:22.307 --> 00:03:24.344
where you block all other JavaScript from running

85
00:03:24.344 --> 00:03:26.413
cause you might have other background tasks,

86
00:03:26.413 --> 00:03:29.114
notifications, downloading stuff,

87
00:03:29.114 --> 00:03:31.587
listening for clicks on other items.

88
00:03:31.587 --> 00:03:33.605
You don't wanna block all of JavaScript from running

89
00:03:33.605 --> 00:03:36.296
just because you have this one piece of your application.

90
00:03:36.296 --> 00:03:39.352
That is where async/await comes in

91
00:03:39.352 --> 00:03:41.211
and why it's called async/await

92
00:03:41.211 --> 00:03:45.160
is because you need to first make an asynchronous function

93
00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:49.213
and then inside of that function you can await values.

94
00:03:49.213 --> 00:03:52.016
Let's actually go back into our custom promises

95
00:03:52.016 --> 00:03:56.142
and let's just take out this breathe function real quick

96
00:03:56.142 --> 00:03:58.836
and let's go ahead and paste it in.

97
00:03:58.836 --> 00:04:00.832
Now there's nothing that we need to do

98
00:04:00.832 --> 00:04:02.829
to this breathe function

99
00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:04.395
to make it async/await

100
00:04:04.395 --> 00:04:06.547
because at the core

101
00:04:06.547 --> 00:04:09.650
async/await is just built on top of promises.

102
00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:12.288
It is not a alternative to promises,

103
00:04:12.288 --> 00:04:14.650
it is not a totally different way of doing it.

104
00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:18.049
You must have a function that is based on promises

105
00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:20.697
in order to async/await anything.

106
00:04:20.697 --> 00:04:22.341
That's why we have all these APIs

107
00:04:22.341 --> 00:04:23.861
that are built on promises

108
00:04:23.861 --> 00:04:25.922
and then we're going to be able to async/await

109
00:04:25.922 --> 00:04:27.215
the actual values that come.

110
00:04:27.215 --> 00:04:28.048
Good.

111
00:04:28.048 --> 00:04:30.798
Don't touch that function at all.

112
00:04:31.705 --> 00:04:32.911
The way it's gonna work is we're gonna say

113
00:04:32.911 --> 00:04:35.828
await breathe(100)

114
00:04:37.189 --> 00:04:40.783
and then we're going to await breathe(500)

115
00:04:40.783 --> 00:04:43.563
and we're going to await breathe(5000).

116
00:04:43.563 --> 00:04:44.453
You get the point right?

117
00:04:44.453 --> 00:04:46.434
On and on and on one line after another

118
00:04:46.434 --> 00:04:49.226
without any thens, without any callbacks, without anything

119
00:04:49.226 --> 00:04:51.554
but this is what is called top level await.

120
00:04:51.554 --> 00:04:53.426
We are not allowed to do this.

121
00:04:53.426 --> 00:04:56.434
If I actually were to run this and refresh

122
00:04:56.434 --> 00:04:59.495
it'll tell us await is only valid in an async function

123
00:04:59.495 --> 00:05:01.664
because this await function

124
00:05:01.664 --> 00:05:04.333
cannot just be done willy nilly out in the open.

125
00:05:04.333 --> 00:05:06.005
It needs to be done in a function

126
00:05:06.005 --> 00:05:08.186
that's been marked as async.

127
00:05:08.186 --> 00:05:10.786
So what we're gonna do is we're gonna make a function.

128
00:05:10.786 --> 00:05:13.575
I'll say function, we'll call it go()

129
00:05:13.575 --> 00:05:16.555
and we can then inside of that await

130
00:05:16.555 --> 00:05:17.430
and it's still gonna break,

131
00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:18.269
but I'm gonna show you.

132
00:05:18.269 --> 00:05:20.362
We'll say await,

133
00:05:20.362 --> 00:05:23.016
we're going to await the breathe function

134
00:05:23.016 --> 00:05:26.594
which is going to wait for 600 milliseconds.

135
00:05:26.594 --> 00:05:28.532
Now we're still gonna get that error.

136
00:05:28.532 --> 00:05:31.200
Await is only valid in an async function,

137
00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:33.863
however, if we now mark this function as async

138
00:05:33.863 --> 00:05:35.472
by just putting the word async

139
00:05:35.472 --> 00:05:37.013
in front of the word function.

140
00:05:37.013 --> 00:05:39.555
You can also mark a arrow function async

141
00:05:39.555 --> 00:05:43.472
by doing things like const go is equal to async

142
00:05:44.443 --> 00:05:46.412
and then it's just in a regular old arrow function

143
00:05:46.412 --> 00:05:47.353
that we have there.

144
00:05:47.353 --> 00:05:49.139
That's the way that you mark that.

145
00:05:49.139 --> 00:05:52.268
Then we we are able to use the await inside of it.

146
00:05:52.268 --> 00:05:53.226
So watch this.

147
00:05:53.226 --> 00:05:56.084
If we console.log('start')

148
00:05:56.084 --> 00:06:00.762
and console.log('end') in the middle.

149
00:06:00.762 --> 00:06:02.849
Oh yeah, I guess we have to call this function

150
00:06:02.849 --> 00:06:05.650
on page loader from the console or something like that.

151
00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:07.082
Then we see start immediately

152
00:06:07.082 --> 00:06:10.002
and then after one second we see end, right?

153
00:06:10.002 --> 00:06:12.860
You notice there is no chaining of callbacks here,

154
00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:15.122
there's no thens that we need to do,

155
00:06:15.122 --> 00:06:17.239
there's no scoping that gets introduced,

156
00:06:17.239 --> 00:06:18.623
it's all one level

157
00:06:18.623 --> 00:06:21.063
and I could do these as long as I want.

158
00:06:21.063 --> 00:06:25.248
We can also capture the value that this function returns.

159
00:06:25.248 --> 00:06:27.282
If I were to say like const the response

160
00:06:27.282 --> 00:06:28.764
is equal to await breathe,

161
00:06:28.764 --> 00:06:31.097
in console.log the response.

162
00:06:32.212 --> 00:06:36.352
Then I could do this a couple times over, why not?

163
00:06:36.352 --> 00:06:37.185
600,

164
00:06:38.189 --> 00:06:39.022
750, 900.

165
00:06:41.602 --> 00:06:44.583
and we can't use response over and over and over again.

166
00:06:44.583 --> 00:06:45.416
Why?

167
00:06:45.416 --> 00:06:47.583
Because it's response two,

168
00:06:48.495 --> 00:06:51.924
response three, and four cause there is a const there.

169
00:06:51.924 --> 00:06:53.391
Good, start.

170
00:06:53.391 --> 00:06:55.100
Uncaught console.logo.

171
00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:57.528
What am I doing here?

172
00:06:57.528 --> 00:06:58.361
Log.

173
00:07:00.314 --> 00:07:01.147
Done.

174
00:07:01.147 --> 00:07:04.203
See we're getting the values that are being resolved

175
00:07:04.203 --> 00:07:06.223
from our promise function

176
00:07:06.223 --> 00:07:08.752
and we're sticking them directly into

177
00:07:08.752 --> 00:07:10.423
our actual variable there.

178
00:07:10.423 --> 00:07:12.330
If I took this await off

179
00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:14.764
breathe would return a promise,

180
00:07:14.764 --> 00:07:17.624
but by putting the await in front of the promise

181
00:07:17.624 --> 00:07:19.764
breathe will immediately return the promise,

182
00:07:19.764 --> 00:07:22.466
but the await function will sort of just be like

183
00:07:22.466 --> 00:07:25.053
all right everybody hold on for a couple seconds

184
00:07:25.053 --> 00:07:27.695
I'm gonna wait until this breathe function

185
00:07:27.695 --> 00:07:31.186
either resolves a value to me or rejects it

186
00:07:31.186 --> 00:07:33.994
and in that case we have some sort of error.

187
00:07:33.994 --> 00:07:37.655
So that's the very basics of how we do async/await.

188
00:07:37.655 --> 00:07:39.716
The most important part that you need to know here

189
00:07:39.716 --> 00:07:42.255
is that there is no top level await

190
00:07:42.255 --> 00:07:46.023
meaning that you cannot just use await out in the open.

191
00:07:46.023 --> 00:07:47.964
You cannot use await just anywhere

192
00:07:47.964 --> 00:07:51.543
you must have to put an async on the word function.

193
00:07:51.543 --> 00:07:54.532
That said sometimes I'm in just a regular old function

194
00:07:54.532 --> 00:07:57.783
and I need to be able to wait for something.

195
00:07:57.783 --> 00:08:00.892
It's no problem to make a function async

196
00:08:00.892 --> 00:08:03.431
to be able to add just a single await inside of it.

197
00:08:03.431 --> 00:08:06.932
There's no other detrimental effects that come of that.

198
00:08:06.932 --> 00:08:09.897
Let's see it one more time,

199
00:08:09.897 --> 00:08:11.159
working really nicely.

200
00:08:11.159 --> 00:08:13.431
Now, what about this?

201
00:08:13.431 --> 00:08:16.751
Where we have this problem if it's less than 500.

202
00:08:16.751 --> 00:08:18.334
Let's make this 300

203
00:08:21.252 --> 00:08:22.874
and we get an error.

204
00:08:22.874 --> 00:08:26.500
Uncaught in promise that is too small of a value.

205
00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:28.298
So the next video we're actually going to deal with

206
00:08:28.298 --> 00:08:31.431
how do we catch that error if there is no

207
00:08:31.431 --> 00:08:35.598
dot then then then catch in async/await.
