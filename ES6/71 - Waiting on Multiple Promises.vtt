00:00:00.141 --> 00:00:02.669
(upbeat whistling)

2
00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:04.261
<v ->Dealing with multiple promises is something</v>

3
00:00:04.261 --> 00:00:06.891
that I've frequently run into when I'm writing code

4
00:00:06.891 --> 00:00:08.969
and you sort of need to be careful here

5
00:00:08.969 --> 00:00:10.901
with this whole await thing.

6
00:00:10.901 --> 00:00:12.560
And the reason behind that is because

7
00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:16.021
not always do you want to do one thing after another,

8
00:00:16.021 --> 00:00:18.600
often you want to maybe fire off six or seven

9
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.619
tasks at the exact same time and then

10
00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:23.531
wait for them all to come back at the end of the day.

11
00:00:23.531 --> 00:00:26.788
So right here I've got my fetch coming off and I'm

12
00:00:26.788 --> 00:00:29.701
going to go off to github to grab my data

13
00:00:29.701 --> 00:00:32.051
and then after that I'm going to go and grab

14
00:00:32.051 --> 00:00:33.901
Scott Talinski's github data.

15
00:00:33.901 --> 00:00:35.837
So what I could do here is I could just pop a

16
00:00:35.837 --> 00:00:37.749
quick await in front of both of them,

17
00:00:37.749 --> 00:00:40.351
but that's going to take much longer than it has to

18
00:00:40.351 --> 00:00:42.811
because it's going to finish this one,

19
00:00:42.811 --> 00:00:45.038
before it even starts this one.

20
00:00:45.038 --> 00:00:46.432
Ideally what we want is for them both

21
00:00:46.432 --> 00:00:49.720
to be gone at the exact same time.

22
00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:51.840
So what we're gonna do is we're going to store

23
00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.840
not the returned results,

24
00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:55.512
which is what await would give us,

25
00:00:55.512 --> 00:00:58.501
but we're gonna store the promise in a variable

26
00:00:58.501 --> 00:01:00.531
called promise one, P1.

27
00:01:00.531 --> 00:01:02.560
And then a variable called P2.

28
00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:07.088
Now I'm down here, how do I wait for both of them

29
00:01:07.088 --> 00:01:08.171
to come back?

30
00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:13.080
Well the way that we do that is we can make a variable,

31
00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.247
let's call it response and we wrap it in a promise.all,

32
00:01:18.396 --> 00:01:21.669
and promise.all takes an array of promises.

33
00:01:21.669 --> 00:01:23.477
So we'll say promise one and promise two.

34
00:01:23.477 --> 00:01:25.736
What that's gonna do is it's sorta gonna make one

35
00:01:25.736 --> 00:01:28.437
mega promise out of these two smaller ones

36
00:01:28.437 --> 00:01:31.487
and the mega promise will not resolve itself

37
00:01:31.487 --> 00:01:35.887
until both promises, promise one and promise two come back.

38
00:01:35.887 --> 00:01:37.999
So if wesbos comes back in a second,

39
00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:39.439
but Scott's takes 10 seconds,

40
00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:42.359
the whole thing is gonna take 10 seconds altogether.

41
00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:44.010
And of course we need to await that,

42
00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:46.500
so we pop await in front of it and then we will

43
00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.831
console.log the response there.

44
00:01:48.831 --> 00:01:51.882
So now if I refresh you'll see response, response,

45
00:01:51.882 --> 00:01:55.781
this is not the end user data you may remember

46
00:01:55.781 --> 00:01:58.181
that this fetch requires us to do sort of a

47
00:01:58.181 --> 00:02:00.882
two parter, where first you fetch the data,

48
00:02:00.882 --> 00:02:04.698
and then you turn it into json which turns another promise.

49
00:02:04.698 --> 00:02:06.130
So there's a couple ways around that.

50
00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:09.301
First and probably easiest is you can just tack a

51
00:02:09.301 --> 00:02:13.629
.then onto each of these so dot then you get your response

52
00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:16.018
and you return the response .json,

53
00:02:16.018 --> 00:02:18.258
you could just use R there to keep it short.

54
00:02:18.258 --> 00:02:21.327
And I'll tack both of that onto each one.

55
00:02:21.327 --> 00:02:24.271
And what that will do is this promise right here

56
00:02:24.271 --> 00:02:27.558
will actually be the second promise that gets returned

57
00:02:27.558 --> 00:02:30.759
right here, not the actual initial fetch one.

58
00:02:30.759 --> 00:02:32.427
Let's see if that works.

59
00:02:32.427 --> 00:02:35.327
There we go, refresh and then we've got --

60
00:02:35.327 --> 00:02:39.358
Oh! No, that's not our data, why is it not working?

61
00:02:39.358 --> 00:02:41.300
Because we're returning the function json,

62
00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.159
make sure you put parenthesis on the end

63
00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:44.788
of our json there.

64
00:02:44.788 --> 00:02:46.129
There we go.

65
00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:50.138
Now open that up, it's an array wesbos and stalinski.

66
00:02:50.138 --> 00:02:51.111
We've got both of 'em.

67
00:02:51.111 --> 00:02:52.978
The other way that you could do it if you don't feel like

68
00:02:52.978 --> 00:02:55.380
tacking a then onto each of them,

69
00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:59.128
is you could take that array of promises,

70
00:02:59.128 --> 00:03:00.939
and map over them.

71
00:03:00.939 --> 00:03:04.009
So here we have is, we await our promise and this is

72
00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:07.503
actually going to be an array and what we could do is

73
00:03:07.503 --> 00:03:10.852
then turn that into another thing that we promise all.

74
00:03:10.852 --> 00:03:13.435
We'll say const data, promises,

75
00:03:15.263 --> 00:03:18.401
you can take the response promises and we just map over

76
00:03:18.401 --> 00:03:19.234
each one.

77
00:03:19.234 --> 00:03:21.861
For each response we're gonna return the response

78
00:03:21.861 --> 00:03:25.052
.json and then this data promises,

79
00:03:25.052 --> 00:03:27.343
if we were to console.log that,

80
00:03:27.343 --> 00:03:30.073
it's not gonna be our data just yet,

81
00:03:30.073 --> 00:03:32.192
but you're gonna see that it is an array of

82
00:03:32.192 --> 00:03:36.303
two extra promises which is turning it into json.

83
00:03:36.303 --> 00:03:41.001
So then we could say const wesAndScott is equal to

84
00:03:41.001 --> 00:03:44.918
promise.all and we'll give it our data promises

85
00:03:47.052 --> 00:03:48.620
and of course we wanna pop an await

86
00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:50.620
in front of all of that.

87
00:03:53.001 --> 00:03:56.668
Then finally we can console.log wesAndScott,

88
00:04:00.703 --> 00:04:04.060
open that up there's the same data that we actually have.

89
00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:06.248
That's totally up to you however you like it.

90
00:04:06.248 --> 00:04:08.549
One other thing I really like to use in conjunction of this

91
00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:11.409
is array destructuring because

92
00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:12.911
I made this variable wesAndScott,

93
00:04:12.911 --> 00:04:16.550
but what we can do here instead is destructure those values

94
00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:20.479
immediately into separate variables wes and Scott

95
00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:23.146
and then we have separate variables called wes and Scott

96
00:04:23.146 --> 00:04:25.528
and then you'll see watch this.

97
00:04:25.528 --> 00:04:27.988
Now we have two separate variables that each have

98
00:04:27.988 --> 00:04:29.697
their actual data inside of it.

99
00:04:29.697 --> 00:04:31.740
That's really handy, especially if you have

100
00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:33.780
an array of values which you need you need to fire off

101
00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:36.220
an ajax request for each of the values.

102
00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:38.967
Let's do another little example here.

103
00:04:38.967 --> 00:04:40.929
Let's comment that out,

104
00:04:40.929 --> 00:04:44.429
and we'll make a function called get data.

105
00:04:48.049 --> 00:04:50.209
And I'll just run the get data,

106
00:04:50.209 --> 00:04:53.018
on load and maybe actually we'll pass it

107
00:04:53.018 --> 00:04:55.251
an array of github names.

108
00:04:55.251 --> 00:04:57.334
So wesbos, and stalinski.

109
00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:00.861
How do you spell his name?

110
00:05:00.861 --> 00:05:01.861
There we go.

111
00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:07.221
And then this is going to take in an array of names.

112
00:05:07.221 --> 00:05:09.771
Now, what you could do here is instead of manually doing

113
00:05:09.771 --> 00:05:12.771
P1, P2, we could say const promises,

114
00:05:15.329 --> 00:05:17.741
is equal to names.map.

115
00:05:17.741 --> 00:05:20.891
So for each name, we're going to map over the name,

116
00:05:20.891 --> 00:05:25.091
and from that we're going to return a fetch.

117
00:05:25.091 --> 00:05:28.640
And that fetch is going to be going to,

118
00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:30.890
I'll just take this URL now

119
00:05:34.519 --> 00:05:39.239
and replace my name with the name property that

120
00:05:39.239 --> 00:05:42.169
we're looping over each one and then we can also

121
00:05:42.169 --> 00:05:46.252
if we'd like we can tack a .then on the end where

122
00:05:48.396 --> 00:05:52.140
the response is turned into json right away.

123
00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:54.340
And then finally all we have to do is

124
00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:56.257
await all the promises.

125
00:05:57.512 --> 00:06:01.253
We'll say const wes, Scott is equal to await,

126
00:06:01.253 --> 00:06:05.420
promise.all and we'll pass it that list of actual promises.

127
00:06:08.701 --> 00:06:10.200
That's really simple, let me go over --

128
00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:12.829
Actually let's make sure it works first.

129
00:06:12.829 --> 00:06:13.861
Oh no!

130
00:06:13.861 --> 00:06:16.021
Then is not a function.

131
00:06:16.021 --> 00:06:20.133
That's because I put the then on the wrong side

132
00:06:20.133 --> 00:06:21.872
of the quote.

133
00:06:21.872 --> 00:06:25.821
And then I could console.log, wes and Scott,

134
00:06:25.821 --> 00:06:28.173
separately, give it save and then when I refresh I see

135
00:06:28.173 --> 00:06:30.092
two separate variables.

136
00:06:30.092 --> 00:06:31.443
What's cool about that is that

137
00:06:31.443 --> 00:06:36.291
I can also just say people and put that into an array

138
00:06:36.291 --> 00:06:39.043
itself if we don't know how many people are coming in

139
00:06:39.043 --> 00:06:40.973
and if we were to add a third,

140
00:06:40.973 --> 00:06:42.390
like darcyclarke,

141
00:06:45.424 --> 00:06:47.714
it's gonna automatically just make three requests for us

142
00:06:47.714 --> 00:06:50.092
each with all of them you can go to the network tab

143
00:06:50.092 --> 00:06:53.981
and see all three of our actual requests have been made.

144
00:06:53.981 --> 00:06:56.592
There's a lot you can do with all of the map

145
00:06:56.592 --> 00:06:59.581
and reduce and all of those other methods

146
00:06:59.581 --> 00:07:02.021
that we learned about in our java script 30 course.

147
00:07:02.021 --> 00:07:05.963
And they can be used in conjunction with a sync,

148
00:07:05.963 --> 00:07:07.963
await and a promise.all.

149
00:07:08.973 --> 00:07:11.072
Last one I want to show you is you can also use

150
00:07:11.072 --> 00:07:14.453
promise.race, we learned about this in a previous video.

151
00:07:14.453 --> 00:07:18.053
For example, if you had multiple requests going off

152
00:07:18.053 --> 00:07:22.061
at once and you only cared for the quickest one to

153
00:07:22.061 --> 00:07:25.031
come back then you could use promise.race and that will

154
00:07:25.031 --> 00:07:27.901
resolve as soon as the first promise of the array

155
00:07:27.901 --> 00:07:29.301
of promises that come back.

156
00:07:29.301 --> 00:07:31.380
I've never actually had to use that in a real world

157
00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:34.220
situation but there could be some use cases there

158
00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:36.643
where you're picking multiple URL's and you

159
00:07:36.643 --> 00:07:38.952
only care about the fastest one to get back to you.

160
00:07:38.952 --> 00:07:42.404
Other than that, I will see you in the next one.
