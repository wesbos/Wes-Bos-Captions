00:00:01.056 --> 00:00:02.755
<v Narrator>Hi, in this video we're gonna make</v>

2
00:00:02.755 --> 00:00:04.564
this interface here where you're able

3
00:00:04.564 --> 00:00:06.245
to manage the users permissions.

4
00:00:06.245 --> 00:00:08.275
So there's a lot really going on here

5
00:00:08.275 --> 00:00:09.383
because we've got.

6
00:00:09.383 --> 00:00:12.124
First of all, we need a new query to fetch all of the users

7
00:00:12.124 --> 00:00:14.952
and their permissions and then second we need a new mutation

8
00:00:14.952 --> 00:00:16.821
which will allow the user to update it.

9
00:00:16.821 --> 00:00:21.369
And at the same time, we also need to you check if the user

10
00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:24.612
who is updating permissions has the permission

11
00:00:24.612 --> 00:00:27.545
to update permissions like, what!

12
00:00:27.545 --> 00:00:30.686
This is gonna be cyclical, so hold on.

13
00:00:30.686 --> 00:00:32.623
Let's kind of break it down into a couple things.

14
00:00:32.623 --> 00:00:35.549
So first thing we wanna do is let's just get a list of users

15
00:00:35.549 --> 00:00:37.645
and their respective permissions,

16
00:00:37.645 --> 00:00:40.337
showing up on the page here.

17
00:00:40.337 --> 00:00:43.351
So, that's going to be a new query

18
00:00:43.351 --> 00:00:46.112
and we're gonna do that on the back end.

19
00:00:46.112 --> 00:00:48.160
So let's open up our schema.

20
00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.689
Let's go to our query and we're just going to say,

21
00:00:50.689 --> 00:00:52.692
we want a new query called users.

22
00:00:52.692 --> 00:00:57.440
And that is going to return an array of users

23
00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.286
or user sorry, and then we're gonna have a bang on the end.

24
00:01:00.286 --> 00:01:01.744
The reason why we have a bang here is

25
00:01:01.744 --> 00:01:06.123
that the array itself is required to be returned,

26
00:01:06.123 --> 00:01:08.321
but the array might be empty.

27
00:01:08.321 --> 00:01:12.965
So we're not going to make the actual user itself a query

28
00:01:12.965 --> 00:01:14.160
because then you could run into issues

29
00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:15.948
where there's no users in your database

30
00:01:15.948 --> 00:01:19.123
or your specific filter, it returns no one.

31
00:01:19.123 --> 00:01:21.266
And we do want it to return an empty array.

32
00:01:21.266 --> 00:01:23.658
Then what do you do when you modify your schema?

33
00:01:23.658 --> 00:01:25.156
You set up a resolver.

34
00:01:25.156 --> 00:01:28.454
So let's open up our query.js.

35
00:01:28.454 --> 00:01:30.079
This is that, we haven't done much work in here.

36
00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:30.982
A lot of our stuff has been done

37
00:01:30.982 --> 00:01:34.267
in the mutation.js of writing resolvers.

38
00:01:34.267 --> 00:01:36.916
But now we're flipping over to query.js right here.

39
00:01:36.916 --> 00:01:39.394
And lets say we have our me showing up here.

40
00:01:39.394 --> 00:01:42.068
So we're gonna make a new one called users,

41
00:01:42.068 --> 00:01:43.452
and that's going to be a sync,

42
00:01:43.452 --> 00:01:46.207
and inside of that we have parent,

43
00:01:46.207 --> 00:01:49.935
our args, our context, and our info.

44
00:01:49.935 --> 00:01:52.682
Then inside of that, we really just need to do two things.

45
00:01:52.682 --> 00:01:57.682
First, check if the user has the permissions

46
00:01:57.818 --> 00:01:59.829
to query all the users.

47
00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:01.819
Because we don't want anyone just come into our API

48
00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:04.703
and running a query and getting the user's email address

49
00:02:04.703 --> 00:02:07.315
and their cards and anything like that.

50
00:02:07.315 --> 00:02:09.455
And second thing what we want to do is

51
00:02:09.455 --> 00:02:14.455
if they do query all the users.

52
00:02:15.003 --> 00:02:16.219
So, first thing I'm gonna do is check

53
00:02:16.219 --> 00:02:17.640
if they're logged in actually.

54
00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.381
So, one is check if they are logged in

55
00:02:21.381 --> 00:02:24.059
and then two is check if they have any questions.

56
00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:27.142
So if there's no ctx.requests.

57
00:02:28.525 --> 00:02:29.699
.userid

58
00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:32.896
then somebody just throw a new error in

59
00:02:32.896 --> 00:02:34.637
and this is something we've done three or four times.

60
00:02:34.637 --> 00:02:37.637
Now you could probably refactor this out

61
00:02:37.637 --> 00:02:39.680
into a separate function that says is logged in.

62
00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.619
That will check, that we'll take in the request

63
00:02:42.619 --> 00:02:44.719
and check for a user ID.

64
00:02:44.719 --> 00:02:46.644
But it's fairly simple, so I don't mind keeping

65
00:02:46.644 --> 00:02:47.650
it as explicit right here.

66
00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.317
So throw a new error, you must be logged in.

67
00:02:52.258 --> 00:02:53.231
Okay.

68
00:02:53.231 --> 00:02:55.340
Then and what we're going to do is check if the user

69
00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:56.173
has a permission.

70
00:02:56.173 --> 00:02:59.950
So if you open up this utils.js file in the source folder.

71
00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:01.896
You see I gave you this little function called

72
00:03:01.896 --> 00:03:03.344
has permission.

73
00:03:03.344 --> 00:03:04.924
And the reason why I've given you this

74
00:03:04.924 --> 00:03:06.054
is because it's a little bit complicated.

75
00:03:06.054 --> 00:03:08.023
Because you might have like a user

76
00:03:08.023 --> 00:03:09.811
which looks like something like this,

77
00:03:09.811 --> 00:03:11.366
or you have the name is Wes.

78
00:03:11.366 --> 00:03:14.979
And the permissions on that user are going

79
00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:19.979
to be something like admin and item update.

80
00:03:20.095 --> 00:03:22.891
Right, those are the two permissions that that user has.

81
00:03:22.891 --> 00:03:24.980
But then you also wanna like check,

82
00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:28.205
if they have any of these.

83
00:03:28.205 --> 00:03:31.990
And we wanna check, do they have permission update or admin?

84
00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:34.740
Right, so we're not checking if they have all of these,

85
00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:35.573
we're just checking like,

86
00:03:35.573 --> 00:03:39.066
is there any overlap between what they have?

87
00:03:39.066 --> 00:03:40.699
and what we're looking for, right?

88
00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:42.729
Because we only need them to have one.

89
00:03:42.729 --> 00:03:45.947
So, what we do here is we make this function

90
00:03:45.947 --> 00:03:49.675
that takes in the user and takes in an array of permissions

91
00:03:49.675 --> 00:03:50.955
that are needed.

92
00:03:50.955 --> 00:03:55.955
And then we filter the users permissions to see if any of

93
00:03:56.086 --> 00:03:59.686
them match the ones that we're specifically looking for.

94
00:03:59.686 --> 00:04:02.344
So we loop over every single permission and we say,

95
00:04:02.344 --> 00:04:04.419
is the permission that is needed included

96
00:04:04.419 --> 00:04:06.786
in the permission that they have?

97
00:04:06.786 --> 00:04:10.747
If so, put it in the array and if that array has no length

98
00:04:10.747 --> 00:04:13.647
at the end of the day, meaning that they have no permissions

99
00:04:13.647 --> 00:04:15.415
we just throw an error.

100
00:04:15.415 --> 00:04:17.445
And I'd like to do this for debugging purposes,

101
00:04:17.445 --> 00:04:19.387
is show the permissions that are needed,

102
00:04:19.387 --> 00:04:21.673
and show the permissions that the user has.

103
00:04:21.673 --> 00:04:24.372
And then that will give us a little bit of a more visual

104
00:04:24.372 --> 00:04:25.205
look into it.

105
00:04:25.205 --> 00:04:26.783
And otherwise, we don't do anything.

106
00:04:26.783 --> 00:04:28.387
And no error we'll be thrown

107
00:04:28.387 --> 00:04:30.667
and that function will just will not return anything

108
00:04:30.667 --> 00:04:32.067
and then we 'll just keep going.

109
00:04:32.067 --> 00:04:35.187
So what we want to do, is go back to our query digest

110
00:04:35.187 --> 00:04:36.328
and import that.

111
00:04:36.328 --> 00:04:39.995
So, we're going to say const has permissions

112
00:04:41.284 --> 00:04:46.284
is equal to require, utils

113
00:04:46.605 --> 00:04:48.346
and we'll take that has permissions function

114
00:04:48.346 --> 00:04:49.179
and go down here.

115
00:04:49.179 --> 00:04:51.078
So we'll just say has permissions

116
00:04:51.078 --> 00:04:55.999
request.ctx.request.user

117
00:04:55.999 --> 00:04:57.599
and we're going to check if they either

118
00:04:57.599 --> 00:04:59.015
have the admit privilege,

119
00:04:59.015 --> 00:05:04.015
or, or and/or the permission update.

120
00:05:04.308 --> 00:05:05.921
Because we don't want to show them this unless

121
00:05:05.921 --> 00:05:08.382
they're able to actually update it.

122
00:05:08.382 --> 00:05:11.328
And then that if that is fine

123
00:05:11.328 --> 00:05:13.479
then it'll keep going if it's not it'll throw an error

124
00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:15.725
and we'll be able to display that on the client side.

125
00:05:15.725 --> 00:05:18.655
And then finally if they are requiring all the users,

126
00:05:18.655 --> 00:05:22.488
so finally we can just return ctx.db.users.

127
00:05:23.741 --> 00:05:26.253
And we can pass an empty where object

128
00:05:26.253 --> 00:05:28.479
because we just want to query all of the users.

129
00:05:28.479 --> 00:05:30.359
And then we just pass the info

130
00:05:30.359 --> 00:05:33.831
and again the info is going to include the graph QL query

131
00:05:33.831 --> 00:05:36.939
that contains the fields that we're requesting

132
00:05:36.939 --> 00:05:38.522
from the front end.

133
00:05:39.891 --> 00:05:42.440
So that looks pretty good.

134
00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:47.440
Now what we want to do, is flip over to our front end

135
00:05:47.644 --> 00:05:49.716
and see if it even works.

136
00:05:49.716 --> 00:05:52.966
So let's go back to our front end here.

137
00:05:54.533 --> 00:05:58.287
Let's create a new page called permissions.

138
00:05:58.287 --> 00:06:01.524
So not in the components folder in the pages folder.

139
00:06:01.524 --> 00:06:06.357
Js, its gonna take all the code from sell.js.

140
00:06:08.027 --> 00:06:09.919
Paste it into my permissions

141
00:06:09.919 --> 00:06:11.148
and then just start deleting stuff.

142
00:06:11.148 --> 00:06:13.546
So I don't need that.

143
00:06:13.546 --> 00:06:17.370
We can keep the place sign-in and inside of here.

144
00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:21.188
We're just going to put a paragraph as permissions

145
00:06:21.188 --> 00:06:25.105
and we'll rename this component to permissions.

146
00:06:26.658 --> 00:06:27.949
Looking good.

147
00:06:27.949 --> 00:06:29.727
So if we go back to our application

148
00:06:29.727 --> 00:06:31.327
and go to four slash permissions,

149
00:06:31.327 --> 00:06:34.244
doesn't work cause I got to start my app.

150
00:06:34.244 --> 00:06:35.636
Moreover here I'll check it, oh.

151
00:06:35.636 --> 00:06:39.671
I think I goofed up another thing on my back-end.

152
00:06:39.671 --> 00:06:42.087
Do I not know how spell require?

153
00:06:42.087 --> 00:06:44.337
Probably screaming at me, and we see

154
00:06:44.337 --> 00:06:47.420
that we have our permissions page popping up.

155
00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:49.271
Good, and then let's go ahead

156
00:06:49.271 --> 00:06:51.789
and make a permissions component cause we didn't.

157
00:06:51.789 --> 00:06:53.429
You never really wanna do a whole bunch of work

158
00:06:53.429 --> 00:06:55.473
on a specific page, not to put everything in

159
00:06:55.473 --> 00:06:56.621
its own component.

160
00:06:56.621 --> 00:07:00.371
So I'm gonna flip over to the front end here.

161
00:07:01.624 --> 00:07:04.856
Go to my components and create a new one called

162
00:07:04.856 --> 00:07:06.689
capital P permissions.

163
00:07:07.576 --> 00:07:11.606
JS and we're gonna import query from react-apollo.

164
00:07:11.606 --> 00:07:15.023
I'm gonna make our permissions component.

165
00:07:23.942 --> 00:07:27.622
And then inside of that, we want a query component

166
00:07:27.622 --> 00:07:31.590
that takes in a query called all users query.

167
00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:36.590
We haven't written that yet but we will in just a second.

168
00:07:36.645 --> 00:07:39.978
Inside of that, we'll give ourselves the

169
00:07:42.003 --> 00:07:43.971
brackets of death.

170
00:07:43.971 --> 00:07:47.061
Just paragraph hey and inside of there

171
00:07:47.061 --> 00:07:50.978
it will have data loading an error.

172
00:07:52.602 --> 00:07:55.435
Up here will import the error from

173
00:07:58.584 --> 00:08:00.167
error message

174
00:08:03.925 --> 00:08:06.425
and will render out the error.

175
00:08:10.357 --> 00:08:11.190
Aah!

176
00:08:15.324 --> 00:08:17.942
I'm gonna wrap that in a div

177
00:08:17.942 --> 00:08:19.352
and put the arrow inside of that

178
00:08:19.352 --> 00:08:22.742
and the paragraph just says hey.

179
00:08:22.742 --> 00:08:26.659
All right we got to export default permissions,

180
00:08:28.989 --> 00:08:30.896
and then we'll go back to our permissions page

181
00:08:30.896 --> 00:08:32.658
and import the permissions component.

182
00:08:32.658 --> 00:08:37.491
So import permissions from

183
00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:46.756
then render out instead of a paragraph.

184
00:08:46.756 --> 00:08:49.423
Let's render out the permissions

185
00:08:53.276 --> 00:08:54.461
component.

186
00:08:54.461 --> 00:08:58.044
All right, so what do we got going on here?

187
00:08:59.588 --> 00:09:00.975
Duplicate declaration permission.

188
00:09:00.975 --> 00:09:03.823
Okay, cause you can't import a component

189
00:09:03.823 --> 00:09:05.242
and also have this thing.

190
00:09:05.242 --> 00:09:10.242
So let's change this thing to permissions page.

191
00:09:14.302 --> 00:09:15.465
All users queries not too fine.

192
00:09:15.465 --> 00:09:16.809
Okay, now we're back in business.

193
00:09:16.809 --> 00:09:18.979
We'll go back here, we got to write this query here.

194
00:09:18.979 --> 00:09:23.300
So say const all_users_query is equals to

195
00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:25.133
we need to import gql.

196
00:09:26.511 --> 00:09:28.020
So we'll go ahead and write a query.

197
00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:30.671
That's going to query all of our users and from each user

198
00:09:30.671 --> 00:09:34.212
we wanna return the ID, the name, the email

199
00:09:34.212 --> 00:09:37.044
and the permissions of that specific user.

200
00:09:37.044 --> 00:09:40.822
Lowercase p on that, and now that we have

201
00:09:40.822 --> 00:09:43.272
this query running, are you able to refresh.

202
00:09:43.272 --> 00:09:46.342
Gql is not defined, I don't know how to type!

203
00:09:46.342 --> 00:09:49.967
There we go, shoot has permissions is not a function.

204
00:09:49.967 --> 00:09:52.043
Flip back to the back end here.

205
00:09:52.043 --> 00:09:54.649
Const has permissions, is that not called

206
00:09:54.649 --> 00:09:57.759
has permission S?

207
00:09:57.759 --> 00:10:00.138
So take off the S there.

208
00:10:00.138 --> 00:10:02.138
And take off the S here.

209
00:10:07.038 --> 00:10:10.237
Out read property permissions of undefined,

210
00:10:10.237 --> 00:10:12.646
and the reason why this is happening is

211
00:10:12.646 --> 00:10:17.646
because we are passing the user to the has permission,

212
00:10:17.897 --> 00:10:20.295
and then if we open up our utils it's looking

213
00:10:20.295 --> 00:10:22.139
for user.permissions.

214
00:10:22.139 --> 00:10:24.245
But one thing that we actually forgot to do,

215
00:10:24.245 --> 00:10:27.656
I forgot to do is that, we never populated the user

216
00:10:27.656 --> 00:10:29.273
on every thing or request.

217
00:10:29.273 --> 00:10:31.975
We only are populating the users ID

218
00:10:31.975 --> 00:10:35.157
and if you remember back, way back a couple videos ago.

219
00:10:35.157 --> 00:10:37.934
How did we actually populate the users ID

220
00:10:37.934 --> 00:10:38.906
on every single request?

221
00:10:38.906 --> 00:10:41.335
We'll use a little bit of Express middleware.

222
00:10:41.335 --> 00:10:43.565
So we can write another piece of Express middleware

223
00:10:43.565 --> 00:10:46.549
that's going to populate the user on every single request.

224
00:10:46.549 --> 00:10:47.435
So let's do that now.

225
00:10:47.435 --> 00:10:51.714
I think it's in index.js, here we go and then this is

226
00:10:51.714 --> 00:10:53.324
where we decoded the JWT.

227
00:10:53.324 --> 00:10:56.023
So we can put the user ID on each request

228
00:10:56.023 --> 00:10:58.098
and we just popped a little bit of middleware in there

229
00:10:58.098 --> 00:11:00.623
where we decoded that and put it

230
00:11:00.623 --> 00:11:02.343
on the request and called next.

231
00:11:02.343 --> 00:11:04.994
So what we're going to do here is the second piece

232
00:11:04.994 --> 00:11:09.270
of middleware is create a middleware

233
00:11:09.270 --> 00:11:14.270
that populates the user on each request

234
00:11:14.349 --> 00:11:16.736
cause we want access to the user on each request,

235
00:11:16.736 --> 00:11:18.520
if they are logged in.

236
00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:19.353
Pretty simple,

237
00:11:19.353 --> 00:11:24.353
so we will take the server.express.use.

238
00:11:27.828 --> 00:11:31.152
That takes in a request, a response, and a next

239
00:11:31.152 --> 00:11:34.723
and first thing I say, if they aren't logged in

240
00:11:34.723 --> 00:11:38.723
skip this, so if there is no quest that user ID,

241
00:11:42.382 --> 00:11:43.632
just call next.

242
00:11:45.470 --> 00:11:49.576
And we actually want to return next because

243
00:11:49.576 --> 00:11:52.004
then we want this function from stop running.

244
00:11:52.004 --> 00:11:53.395
Otherwise we're going to query them.

245
00:11:53.395 --> 00:11:55.937
So set const the user is equal to a weight.

246
00:11:55.937 --> 00:11:58.559
So we should actually mark this as a sync,

247
00:11:58.559 --> 00:12:01.429
if we're gonna use a weight and we're gonna use the db.

248
00:12:01.429 --> 00:12:04.837
Remember we imported the database up here.

249
00:12:04.837 --> 00:12:06.420
Database.query.user

250
00:12:08.825 --> 00:12:11.252
and the where of the user is going

251
00:12:11.252 --> 00:12:15.151
to be equal to the ID is the request.userID.

252
00:12:15.151 --> 00:12:18.454
So we're gonna find a user where the ID is equal

253
00:12:18.454 --> 00:12:20.544
to the request ID which we populated

254
00:12:20.544 --> 00:12:24.853
in the previous middleware and we're awaiting it.

255
00:12:24.853 --> 00:12:26.630
And then we also need to pass you know

256
00:12:26.630 --> 00:12:28.798
that these queries here take two arguments.

257
00:12:28.798 --> 00:12:31.853
First, the where query but second, we need to know

258
00:12:31.853 --> 00:12:33.373
what fields we're gonna be grabbing.

259
00:12:33.373 --> 00:12:36.620
So we can just pass that in single ticks

260
00:12:36.620 --> 00:12:38.545
and this can just be a graph QL query.

261
00:12:38.545 --> 00:12:40.782
We want the ID of the user, we want the permissions

262
00:12:40.782 --> 00:12:42.672
of the user, we want the email

263
00:12:42.672 --> 00:12:45.963
and we want the name of the user.

264
00:12:45.963 --> 00:12:49.546
Then if we, let's just console.log the user

265
00:12:51.002 --> 00:12:53.002
and hit next.

266
00:12:54.473 --> 00:12:58.652
A bet on every single request that we have now,

267
00:12:58.652 --> 00:13:00.492
we're going to see the information about these are,

268
00:13:00.492 --> 00:13:02.576
if you are signed in.

269
00:13:02.576 --> 00:13:04.925
There we go, so every single request that you have

270
00:13:04.925 --> 00:13:06.301
it's gonna hit the database real quick

271
00:13:06.301 --> 00:13:10.213
and grab the current user that we're looking for.

272
00:13:10.213 --> 00:13:12.138
And then we see the permissions.

273
00:13:12.138 --> 00:13:14.135
The last thing we need to do to get rid

274
00:13:14.135 --> 00:13:16.037
of this cannot read permissions on to find.

275
00:13:16.037 --> 00:13:17.356
Is you need to put this user

276
00:13:17.356 --> 00:13:20.696
on the request much like we did right here.

277
00:13:20.696 --> 00:13:24.226
So simply say a request.user is equal to user

278
00:13:24.226 --> 00:13:26.157
and then call next.

279
00:13:26.157 --> 00:13:31.157
Give that a save, and a bet now if your refresh this page,

280
00:13:31.168 --> 00:13:32.787
now it actually worked.

281
00:13:32.787 --> 00:13:35.453
But now it tells us we do not have submission,

282
00:13:35.453 --> 00:13:38.813
sufficient permissions and min permission,

283
00:13:38.813 --> 00:13:40.864
update, you have user.

284
00:13:40.864 --> 00:13:42.904
So that's fine, but this is a bit of a chicken

285
00:13:42.904 --> 00:13:44.724
and the egg problem because like how are you going

286
00:13:44.724 --> 00:13:46.874
to get permission update or admin,

287
00:13:46.874 --> 00:13:48.812
if you don't have the interface?

288
00:13:48.812 --> 00:13:50.047
And how will you build the interface

289
00:13:50.047 --> 00:13:53.689
if you don't have the administrative privileges?

290
00:13:53.689 --> 00:13:55.619
So what I like to do for this is you can

291
00:13:55.619 --> 00:13:58.038
either like write some code where the first person

292
00:13:58.038 --> 00:14:01.576
who signs up for this application is an admin

293
00:14:01.576 --> 00:14:03.878
and you could you could do that when you sign up.

294
00:14:03.878 --> 00:14:06.529
You query all the users, and if there are no existing users

295
00:14:06.529 --> 00:14:08.992
then that person is the admin or you can just manually

296
00:14:08.992 --> 00:14:11.851
go into your database and add that in as you need to.

297
00:14:11.851 --> 00:14:13.440
And that's exactly what I'm going to do here.

298
00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:15.386
So we're going to go into Sick Fits, I'm going

299
00:14:15.386 --> 00:14:18.474
to find myself and you see that my permissions

300
00:14:18.474 --> 00:14:20.882
already has user in it because that was the default

301
00:14:20.882 --> 00:14:22.962
that we put in the signup mutation.

302
00:14:22.962 --> 00:14:25.694
I'm also going to add in the admin.

303
00:14:25.694 --> 00:14:28.122
So go ahead and update.

304
00:14:28.122 --> 00:14:30.789
Now if i refresh this.

305
00:14:32.466 --> 00:14:35.734
(laughing) one more error, all kinds of trouble here.

306
00:14:35.734 --> 00:14:39.367
Shoot ctx.db.users is not a function.

307
00:14:39.367 --> 00:14:43.620
So let's go back to our query here,ctx.bd.

308
00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:47.165
I think it is not ctx.db

309
00:14:47.165 --> 00:14:51.248
and of course, it's ctx.db.query.users.

310
00:14:52.813 --> 00:14:54.003
And will this be it?

311
00:14:54.003 --> 00:14:55.170
Will it be it?

312
00:14:56.146 --> 00:14:59.616
It works, awesome,so we are returning users.

313
00:14:59.616 --> 00:15:02.086
Now we can head back to our front end

314
00:15:02.086 --> 00:15:05.014
which is our permissions here and we should be able

315
00:15:05.014 --> 00:15:08.347
to go in here and console.log, the data,

316
00:15:09.859 --> 00:15:11.886
or, or and this is that little trick again

317
00:15:11.886 --> 00:15:15.374
if you console log data or, or, it will still return

318
00:15:15.374 --> 00:15:16.592
this data here.

319
00:15:16.592 --> 00:15:19.990
But more importantly console.log the data that we have here.

320
00:15:19.990 --> 00:15:22.998
So let's see if that works, open up your dev tools.

321
00:15:22.998 --> 00:15:25.786
Give it a refresh, you'll see that under permissions

322
00:15:25.786 --> 00:15:28.485
on line 18 or console logging the users

323
00:15:28.485 --> 00:15:31.955
that gives us an array and in every single one

324
00:15:31.955 --> 00:15:33.792
you see the email, the ID, the name

325
00:15:33.792 --> 00:15:35.768
and the actual permissions.

326
00:15:35.768 --> 00:15:37.787
Good, so let's write a little bit of code just

327
00:15:37.787 --> 00:15:39.526
to loop over those users so we can actually

328
00:15:39.526 --> 00:15:41.776
get them visually showing up.

329
00:15:41.776 --> 00:15:45.693
Give yourself a div H1 tag, manage permissions.

330
00:15:46.906 --> 00:15:49.085
We are going to use a style table

331
00:15:49.085 --> 00:15:50.456
that I've already created for you.

332
00:15:50.456 --> 00:15:52.513
So let's jump up to the top of this file

333
00:15:52.513 --> 00:15:54.933
and import the capital T table

334
00:15:54.933 --> 00:15:58.016
from the styled components directory.

335
00:16:02.005 --> 00:16:03.277
And then we'll go down here

336
00:16:03.277 --> 00:16:05.947
and give ourselves a capital T table,

337
00:16:05.947 --> 00:16:08.697
inside of that you need a T head,

338
00:16:09.773 --> 00:16:12.514
inside of that you need a table of row,

339
00:16:12.514 --> 00:16:13.934
inside of that you need a TH.

340
00:16:13.934 --> 00:16:15.824
Aren't you glad we don't have to do tables anymore?

341
00:16:15.824 --> 00:16:16.657
This is a nightmare.

342
00:16:16.657 --> 00:16:19.240
Name, email

343
00:16:20.697 --> 00:16:25.175
and then we'll go down right below T head

344
00:16:25.175 --> 00:16:27.508
and give ourselves a T body.

345
00:16:28.493 --> 00:16:33.013
And we'll take the data.users

346
00:16:33.013 --> 00:16:35.930
and map over it, and for each user.

347
00:16:37.523 --> 00:16:41.853
Let's just return the user.name just to dump it

348
00:16:41.853 --> 00:16:44.106
on the page, make sure it's working.

349
00:16:44.106 --> 00:16:47.098
There we go, we've got the name and the email

350
00:16:47.098 --> 00:16:50.466
and then you see Wesbos, Wesbos, Wesbos, dog lover.

351
00:16:50.466 --> 00:16:52.182
Now the other thing that we need, you can see

352
00:16:52.182 --> 00:16:55.128
that here we need to have a heading

353
00:16:55.128 --> 00:16:59.199
for every single permission that we possibly have.

354
00:16:59.199 --> 00:17:01.563
So what I'm going to do is make a quick little array

355
00:17:01.563 --> 00:17:03.733
of all of the possible permissions.

356
00:17:03.733 --> 00:17:06.744
We could also write a query here to query this

357
00:17:06.744 --> 00:17:10.230
from the back end, a list of possible permissions

358
00:17:10.230 --> 00:17:12.593
and then that query would return a list of them

359
00:17:12.593 --> 00:17:13.673
and we could loop over it.

360
00:17:13.673 --> 00:17:14.654
But find it's easier just

361
00:17:14.654 --> 00:17:17.684
to maintain an array of possible permissions.

362
00:17:17.684 --> 00:17:19.271
So we'll go here and I'm going to paste it

363
00:17:19.271 --> 00:17:21.572
in const possible permissions equal

364
00:17:21.572 --> 00:17:23.591
it's an array of admin user.

365
00:17:23.591 --> 00:17:27.148
I don't create, update, delete and permission update.

366
00:17:27.148 --> 00:17:29.209
Those are the ones that we're using in this tutorial.

367
00:17:29.209 --> 00:17:30.398
You can make up your own.

368
00:17:30.398 --> 00:17:33.398
Additionally just make sure that you mirror them

369
00:17:33.398 --> 00:17:36.668
to the enum that we we did on the back end.

370
00:17:36.668 --> 00:17:40.835
So we'll go back over here or underneath the email

371
00:17:42.308 --> 00:17:46.847
and we'll take the possible permissions

372
00:17:46.847 --> 00:17:48.430
and map over those.

373
00:17:49.282 --> 00:17:52.172
Take each permission and from each permission,

374
00:17:52.172 --> 00:17:57.005
we're just gonna return a TH that has the permission

375
00:17:58.209 --> 00:17:59.042
in it.

376
00:18:00.165 --> 00:18:04.022
There we go, so name, email and then a heading

377
00:18:04.022 --> 00:18:06.054
for each of the possible permissions.

378
00:18:06.054 --> 00:18:10.387
And then we're going to have a final TH.

379
00:18:12.053 --> 00:18:15.622
Just as a pointing down emoji or an arrow

380
00:18:15.622 --> 00:18:18.588
or something that's going to be this one right here

381
00:18:18.588 --> 00:18:22.215
because we need another row for our update.

382
00:18:22.215 --> 00:18:24.584
All right that's looking pretty good and now we need

383
00:18:24.584 --> 00:18:26.202
to like fix this right here where

384
00:18:26.202 --> 00:18:27.883
we're mapping over the users.

385
00:18:27.883 --> 00:18:31.182
And rather than map over every single user right inside

386
00:18:31.182 --> 00:18:33.468
of this, there's going to be a lot of logic

387
00:18:33.468 --> 00:18:36.136
that's involved with updating their permissions.

388
00:18:36.136 --> 00:18:38.276
So we're going to kick off that

389
00:18:38.276 --> 00:18:40.596
to a separate component which we'll create right here.

390
00:18:40.596 --> 00:18:44.596
So we'll say class user extends react component.

391
00:18:47.468 --> 00:18:50.193
Right now we just have a render, which is going

392
00:18:50.193 --> 00:18:54.624
to return a TR as we return a table row inside

393
00:18:54.624 --> 00:18:57.634
of the table body for every single user that we have.

394
00:18:57.634 --> 00:19:01.405
And then inside of that we just need to have some TD,

395
00:19:01.405 --> 00:19:03.634
table datas that will match up with all

396
00:19:03.634 --> 00:19:06.402
of the table headings, name, email, each permission

397
00:19:06.402 --> 00:19:07.842
and then a button to update.

398
00:19:07.842 --> 00:19:10.092
So let's say here we'll say

399
00:19:13.459 --> 00:19:16.679
const user is equal this.props.user

400
00:19:16.679 --> 00:19:21.140
and then inside of here, let's just put the user.name

401
00:19:21.140 --> 00:19:22.723
and the user.email.

402
00:19:24.237 --> 00:19:27.449
Then we should be able to map over this.

403
00:19:27.449 --> 00:19:31.407
For each user we're gonna render out a user component

404
00:19:31.407 --> 00:19:34.907
that has a user prop passed in.

405
00:19:37.847 --> 00:19:39.849
And it's yelling at me here,

406
00:19:39.849 --> 00:19:44.639
your render method should have a return statement.

407
00:19:44.639 --> 00:19:47.479
You should know how to spell return, there we go.

408
00:19:47.479 --> 00:19:48.636
Hey, look at this!

409
00:19:48.636 --> 00:19:52.985
Okay, so this is the heading part that we did,

410
00:19:52.985 --> 00:19:56.255
and then these are each of the table rows.

411
00:19:56.255 --> 00:19:57.655
And now what we need to do

412
00:19:57.655 --> 00:20:01.113
is loop over the users permissions and put checkboxes

413
00:20:01.113 --> 00:20:04.196
for if they have those things or not.

414
00:20:05.412 --> 00:20:09.245
So we'll take each of the possible permissions

415
00:20:10.361 --> 00:20:13.209
and we'll map over those again,

416
00:20:13.209 --> 00:20:17.042
and for each permission we are going to return

417
00:20:19.091 --> 00:20:19.924
a TD.

418
00:20:22.083 --> 00:20:24.583
Then inside of that of a label

419
00:20:26.363 --> 00:20:28.718
and this is gonna be calculated since it's going

420
00:20:28.718 --> 00:20:31.809
to be unique to the user and the permission.

421
00:20:31.809 --> 00:20:34.659
So you can use curly brackets and backticks in there

422
00:20:34.659 --> 00:20:36.720
and we're going to use

423
00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:40.159
the user.id

424
00:20:40.159 --> 00:20:43.659
a dash permission dash

425
00:20:47.616 --> 00:20:52.066
the actual permission that we're looping over here in that,

426
00:20:52.066 --> 00:20:53.506
and then inside of the label.

427
00:20:53.506 --> 00:20:57.245
We're just going to give ourselves an input with the type

428
00:20:57.245 --> 00:20:58.245
of checkbox.

429
00:20:59.164 --> 00:21:01.564
And we're gonna have a whole bunch of properties,

430
00:21:01.564 --> 00:21:04.266
on this input that are going to allow us

431
00:21:04.266 --> 00:21:06.375
to update the user's permissions

432
00:21:06.375 --> 00:21:07.903
and save it in state locally.

433
00:21:07.903 --> 00:21:09.813
That's gonna be in the next video, but right now,

434
00:21:09.813 --> 00:21:11.194
this is getting a little bit confusing.

435
00:21:11.194 --> 00:21:13.765
So I wanna make sure that we've got all on the page here.

436
00:21:13.765 --> 00:21:15.675
There we go, we've got all

437
00:21:15.675 --> 00:21:18.756
of the different users checkboxes showing up.

438
00:21:18.756 --> 00:21:20.734
Finally below this loop, we want low

439
00:21:20.734 --> 00:21:22.984
and last TD inside of that.

440
00:21:24.422 --> 00:21:27.044
We want to give ourselves a sick button, I think I given.

441
00:21:27.044 --> 00:21:28.470
Yeah, we have a sick button.

442
00:21:28.470 --> 00:21:31.470
Let's import that import sick button

443
00:21:35.020 --> 00:21:36.137
and go down here.

444
00:21:36.137 --> 00:21:37.470
It solves a sick

445
00:21:40.727 --> 00:21:41.973
button

446
00:21:41.973 --> 00:21:43.390
that says update.

447
00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:48.001
Bam, so this doesn't do anything yet, we have

448
00:21:48.001 --> 00:21:50.941
to code a whole lot of logic in mutations in here.

449
00:21:50.941 --> 00:21:54.090
But so far what we did in this video, is we've queried

450
00:21:54.090 --> 00:21:56.169
all the possible users, we did a whole bunch

451
00:21:56.169 --> 00:21:58.134
of work on the back end to make sure that if anyone

452
00:21:58.134 --> 00:22:00.425
is running this query they do have access

453
00:22:00.425 --> 00:22:02.396
to be able to run this query.

454
00:22:02.396 --> 00:22:05.956
We take it, and we can actually delete that.

455
00:22:05.956 --> 00:22:09.395
We are checking for errors in splaying if there are any

456
00:22:09.395 --> 00:22:11.656
and then we take all the possible permissions

457
00:22:11.656 --> 00:22:12.563
to loop over them.

458
00:22:12.563 --> 00:22:14.573
We take all of the users and loop over them,

459
00:22:14.573 --> 00:22:18.663
and then for each user we loop over the possible permissions

460
00:22:18.663 --> 00:22:20.093
and output a checkbox.

461
00:22:20.093 --> 00:22:21.490
Now we're going to set those to checked

462
00:22:21.490 --> 00:22:24.010
and unchecked depending on, if they have

463
00:22:24.010 --> 00:22:25.037
that permission or not

464
00:22:25.037 --> 00:22:26.627
and then we're gonna write the mutations, so that

465
00:22:26.627 --> 00:22:29.568
when someone clicks on update, it will go to the back end

466
00:22:29.568 --> 00:22:30.833
and perform that mutation.

467
00:22:30.833 --> 00:22:33.391
So hopefully you got that one, we'll see you next video
